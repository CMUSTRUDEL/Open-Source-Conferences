hi everybody welcome I have a pleasure

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,890
this afternoon Glen Campbell he's the

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:30,960
manager of developer relations at

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:33,390
rackspace hosting Glenda's little deep

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,070
it all over for PHP open cloud library

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,870
and the site claim the website framework

00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:44,489
this computer experience done in a while

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:46,500
ago 1970s and in the last several years

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,290
he's been involved in the OpenStack

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,910
compute project including the

00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:56,670
integration of Rackspace's

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:58,110
next-generation cloud previously is also

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,770
going to manager and the senior

00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:04,800
architect at Yahoo and he has experience

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,800
in building before new extremely large

00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:13,280
website which sustained massive amounts

00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:13,280
of traffic from San Antonio Texas

00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:30,170
so it's a bit interesting for me

00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:31,850
arriving in Canada yesterday when I came

00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:34,250
through border control and showed on my

00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:36,850
passport they said have you come from

00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,590
any country that has Ebola infections

00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:43,460
and I said well I just got off a plane

00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:46,370
from Texas and I said no we mean one of

00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:49,600
the Western African ones that has so

00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:51,979
America doesn't count that apparently

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,210
which is very unusual for America not to

00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:55,910
count it something but I'm in that case

00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:58,160
I'm very glad for it I'm going to talk a

00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:00,350
little bit about how to succeed with

00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,450
open source and this this overlaps a

00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,970
little bit with my Coy's presentation if

00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,070
you were here earlier there's some some

00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:09,440
level of confluence there but I'm going

00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:11,450
to talk about attacking open source not

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:17,000
only as a contributor reserved community

00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:20,540
member but also use it to grow how you

00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,220
use it within your company how you get

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:29,560
better at it how you recruit people from

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:32,330
it and so I'm going to start with the

00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,709
question that a lot of people ask at a

00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,300
forum like this you probably don't need

00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:40,459
to ask it but what is open source

00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:42,790
exactly how do you define it you look at

00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:45,200
things like Linux right Linus Torvalds

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:48,380
sort of is the ultimate arbitrator there

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,140
he decides what goes in is Android Open

00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:55,430
Source how many of y'all contributed

00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:57,500
Android right it's it's it's very

00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,780
unusual they don't really accept pull

00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,450
requests from outside it's all done

00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,250
enjoy but yet they release it OpenStack

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:07,430
is really interesting in that it's an

00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:11,750
open source software project but it's

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:13,489
run by the OpenStack foundation and you

00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,780
can buy your way onto the OpenStack

00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:16,130
Foundation Board of Directors by

00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,959
contributing a lot of money so big

00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,130
companies if they contribute a few

00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,110
million dollars to the OpenStack

00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:24,080
foundation get a position on the board

00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:26,209
of directors so it's not necessarily as

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,950
open governance as you like by the way

00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:29,340
how many of y'all

00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,950
familiar with openstack heard the term

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,569
open source cloud management software

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:37,330
similar to what AWS does with amazon

00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:38,920
free and available open source Rackspace

00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,480
and NASA were the founders but there's

00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,750
now a hundred and thirty companies i

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,360
think participating in it so what we

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,660
mean by open source is that it's

00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:52,450
released under an open source license

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:55,299
this is what open source org sort of the

00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:59,799
arbitrator of this decides is what open

00:03:55,299 --> 00:04:02,049
source means a note by the way that this

00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,670
stuff was written by lawyers so these

00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:05,829
are the section headings and each has

00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:08,140
multiple pages of explanation beneath

00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:11,739
them so that that's really what open

00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:13,150
source means if you decide to dig into

00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:14,410
the depths of it which I don't really

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,070
recommend unless you're having trouble

00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:20,889
getting to sleep really what it comes

00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:24,430
down to is if the software is released

00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:26,889
under an open source license we consider

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:30,669
it open source these are the most

00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:32,710
popular licenses if you've ever worked

00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:34,510
for a big company you've probably had

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:37,270
lawyers get really nervous about some of

00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:39,460
this for example at Rackspace we are

00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:44,770
encouraged to use the apache license 2.0

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:48,250
or the MIT license we cannot use

00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:50,680
anything this GP elled right because GPL

00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,270
is one of these licenses that goes far

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,010
beyond the software and actually takes

00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,139
control over any sort of intellectual

00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:58,000
property that the company owns and gives

00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:59,530
that away to everyone and that's not

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
something a for-profit business is

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:05,620
willing to do so that's what open source

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,919
is that's sort of the beginning part of

00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:12,970
it but here's how businesses see open

00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:17,620
source software right it doesn't cost

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:19,780
them anything is that correct no you're

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,700
absolutely right there are costs

00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,490
associated with it just like their costs

00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:28,210
associated with any software there's the

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:30,490
immediate acquisition cost right but

00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:33,070
there's also the costs of deployment of

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,720
training people of doing the maintenance

00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,180
on it of hiring people that know how to

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,569
run it and use it those don't go away

00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:42,259
just because you're using a

00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:43,729
source software they can change it that

00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,559
can change the behavior they can they

00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:48,559
can sometimes give you other options you

00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:49,909
wouldn't have but you need you aware

00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:51,649
that your costs simply don't go away

00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:53,929
just because you're using an open source

00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:56,270
package as having a chat with some

00:05:53,929 --> 00:05:57,709
people earlier that said people seem to

00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,589
think they just buy the software it will

00:05:57,709 --> 00:06:01,610
install itself right it doesn't do that

00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:04,879
it's no different than any other

00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,439
software that away sometimes you don't

00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:10,779
really want to use always open source

00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:12,889
software we don't use it for anything

00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:15,709
software that has to do with

00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:18,349
confidential proprietary information so

00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:21,020
for example the rackspace code that uses

00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:22,909
that that handles credit card payments

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,319
we don't want to give that away so no

00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:29,089
one can get access that's totally

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,889
proprietary in eternal likewise there

00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:32,779
are companies that put a premium on risk

00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:35,209
management if you work for an insurance

00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:37,279
company or something like that anything

00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:39,529
that introduces risk into their system

00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,229
they want to keep under the covers so to

00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:45,050
speak they want to share the costs and

00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:47,619
price of that but there are some real

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,419
clear advantages to open source software

00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:53,449
the obvious one is the low cost of

00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:54,979
acquisition there's transparency you can

00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:59,209
go in and look at the code and see what

00:06:54,979 --> 00:07:01,579
it's doing right there usually is a

00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:02,899
community that maintains it right you

00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:04,219
don't gotta go hire people to go

00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:06,919
maintain the software for you they're

00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:09,050
out there doing it voluntarily most of

00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:11,059
the time there's a community that will

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,729
support you and help you again if you

00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:15,050
follow my Coy's the the best ones have

00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:17,569
great communities around it if you're

00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,639
using Python or tools out there and very

00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:23,779
often they're the coolest new shiny

00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:25,309
stuff right you've got old legacy

00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:27,050
software that's bending out there for

00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:28,639
years everyone gets sort of tired of it

00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,709
but it goes on making money for company

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,949
so they use it but really this is hot

00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:35,569
and sexy and that's what everyone likes

00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:39,619
now these are all gross generalizations

00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:42,409
right there's a sliding scale of what

00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:44,629
advantages are just the same way there's

00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:46,579
problems for a differing value of

00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:48,050
problems for different people but

00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:49,380
they're generalizations unlike

00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:55,290
generalizations they're off

00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:57,360
true first off open source software was

00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:01,290
not written with your business in mind

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,600
in nearly every case someone out there

00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,670
had a problem to solve they went out and

00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,220
wrote some software they solved that

00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:11,430
problem and there may be a good match

00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:14,040
with a problem your business has but not

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,140
necessarily an exact match so that

00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:20,630
software wasn't written to solve your

00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:23,130
problem development can be very slow

00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:24,630
right if you're if you're in the process

00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,090
of trying to get a product out the door

00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:29,220
in a month it may be better to get 10

00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,900
people stick them in the back room throw

00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,910
some pizza and every day and get code

00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:36,240
out at the end of it to get things done

00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:38,310
quickly in open source it's typically

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,150
community driven and community means oh

00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:44,010
I've got a different opinion than you do

00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,330
I don't like the way you did that I'm

00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,730
going to back your change out and make a

00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,230
fix to it let's add this other feature

00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,670
that don't ask for we'll put that in

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,110
there right those are the sorts of

00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,780
things that go on an open source it's

00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:57,870
not as rapid development as traditional

00:08:54,780 --> 00:09:01,230
heads down development there and maybe

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,910
missing features right this open source

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,040
project may do ninety percent of what

00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:09,290
you want and they may be very hesitant

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,940
to add those new features in for you a

00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,980
lot of times there are support there's

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,710
community out there but they're not on a

00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,420
pager they don't respond when your site

00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:21,720
or when your application is down and not

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,280
running for a time and in fact you may

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,410
be lucky to get a response at all in

00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,820
some cases they may go oh someone else

00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,440
knows better how to answer that question

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,620
and so they wait for someone else to do

00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,170
it and then nothing happens there's no s

00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,660
la's right if you're in one of these

00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:39,570
businesses that relies on risk

00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,550
management there's no liability there I

00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,910
spent some time as a consultant at wells

00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:46,710
fargo bank in San Francisco number of

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:49,380
years ago and they were showing me the

00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,500
machines that actually ran their website

00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,580
the wellsfargo.com and I was going

00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,640
you're using like these fifty five

00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:58,860
thousand dollar son sparks system

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,420
servers you could just go buy a

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,239
two-thousand-dollar server and have a

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,549
bunch of

00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:06,109
to run your site on what is this and

00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:08,179
their their response was I thought very

00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:09,920
telling it said we don't really care

00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:13,519
about the price we just want someone

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,889
there to sue if it breaks right so a

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,529
company like that is only interested in

00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:20,239
risk management they don't care really

00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:22,669
what the cost is they've got the money

00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:24,350
for whatever they need to do what they

00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:26,359
want to have is shared liability if

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,459
their side goes down and someone they

00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:30,459
can sue and get some money from if they

00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:34,220
can't process transactions for a while

00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:36,079
and then finally in most open source

00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,029
cases there's not going to be anyone to

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,189
sort of do the integration into your own

00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:43,480
internal systems you're going to have to

00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:46,459
take that on yourself and do it manually

00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,290
so these are some gross generalizations

00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:50,509
sort of big descriptions what we're

00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,970
going to get into is sort of the

00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:56,529
relationships that you can have with

00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:59,029
open source software first one is a user

00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:01,850
right how many of y'all use open source

00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:04,600
software ever installed WordPress or

00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:07,339
okay nearly everyone here is a user

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,439
second one is a contributor you've

00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:11,569
actually written code submitted it I bet

00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:13,399
we got a few of those here to put a pull

00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:16,549
request or something less less than the

00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:18,439
user right how many of you are an owner

00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:20,480
you've actually had a project that you

00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:22,540
started that you built that you sort of

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,949
gave to the world and lead for a while

00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:28,730
much smaller a couple of people okay

00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:31,429
great and then finally the pundits you

00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,439
know the people who all the trolls who

00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:36,379
sort of loiter around and make problems

00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:37,639
for things they're real Lakes is I'm not

00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:40,220
going to ask you to raise hands there by

00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:42,610
the way we're going to go over each of

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:46,309
those in more detail though okay

00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:48,799
starting with the users now the users

00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:51,919
here what they could get from working

00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:54,589
with open source software is they get

00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:59,089
really existing software at little cost

00:11:54,589 --> 00:12:00,439
and no effort right they sometimes get

00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:02,779
along without a very passionate

00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:05,600
community to support it you know

00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:08,029
WordPress is a great example it's free

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,470
there's literally hundreds of thousands

00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:12,139
of people who will answer your questions

00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,370
if you have a problem that comes up with

00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:17,540
your running it

00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:19,980
the quality is somewhat variable right

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,149
you don't have any control over that in

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,370
the end you're going to sort of take

00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:25,320
what you're given and then the

00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:29,250
documentation on an open source project

00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:32,190
is again highly variable some of them

00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:34,350
are brand if you look at django for

00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:40,890
example the docs off they are great you

00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:42,450
have questioned the other okay right so

00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,760
there's tons of projects out there that

00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:46,890
have brilliant documentation others that

00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,050
have little or none you get a readme

00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:51,029
file that says here's this

00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:55,160
unintelligible set of commands to run

00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:57,750
and install this and good luck right now

00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,300
if you're a user of an open source

00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:02,070
project you don't have any of those

00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,110
guarantees of support you don't have an

00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:05,490
800 number you can pick up and call in

00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,839
the middle of the night if something

00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:11,279
breaks right you don't have a trusted

00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:13,050
supplier who can come over and fix

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,519
things and they're not going to give you

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:18,870
a refund if something doesn't work there

00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:20,130
there's also no commitment to do the

00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,399
things you want if you wanted to add a

00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:25,980
feature to this package you can ask you

00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,320
can submit an issue but very often

00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:31,140
you're going to get the well patches are

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,180
accepted right like Mike said in the

00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,339
last session there's no commitment to

00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,750
add those or do things you want you're

00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,220
going to sort of be best there and then

00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:41,220
there's course again no help with

00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:45,720
integration so if you have a project

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,860
that uses open source software one of

00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,279
the sum of things you can do is you can

00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:52,290
keep in touch right that community is

00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:54,630
sometimes vague it's amorphous people go

00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,980
on you know they leave for a while to

00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,140
come back they get hired by a different

00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,660
company keep in touch with that

00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,459
community the very least join the

00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,800
mailing list find out where the mailing

00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:08,910
list is keep up with the new releases

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,610
right find out what's coming one of the

00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:12,779
biggest problems I've ever seen is

00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,899
mom-and-pop business goes out they hire

00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:17,279
someone that to come in and install a

00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:19,560
package for their website that person

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,089
goes in and installs it and five years

00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,100
later they're still running that exact

00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:23,550
same version of that software because

00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,070
they can

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,800
for to go bring the guy back right and

00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:31,980
now it's got five years worth of

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,510
documented exploits against it it has

00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,850
all of the problems that have been fixed

00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:37,529
elsewhere if you're going to use it make

00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:40,620
a commitment to keep it up to date and

00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:42,630
keep running it and then when you

00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,269
integrate it have an integration plan

00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:47,370
and test it it's very easy to say but

00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:49,769
it's a lot it's very trivial to sort of

00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:54,720
just grab it and go install but the fact

00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:56,430
is test them before you use them get

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,589
involved with community again follow the

00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:00,329
bug reports you know put the issues into

00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:03,180
github or wherever they're storing this

00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:07,290
do that a great thing you can do is show

00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:10,110
appreciation right yes it may cost a

00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:12,360
little money sometimes but you can do

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,070
wonderful things by buying someone an

00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,240
Android tablet and you'd say thank you

00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,519
for all the work you did on this project

00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,320
you know man they'll love you for that

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,810
and then they'll be much more likely to

00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,640
listen to you in the future finally

00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:26,250
understand that these people who are

00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,890
building this open-source project do not

00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:32,040
work for you they do not have your

00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:34,560
schedules and you can't fire them if

00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,450
they fail to meet them so you go online

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,890
you ask when's the next release of this

00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:41,270
going to be out with this critical bug

00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:44,820
fixed and they say Oh November 30th well

00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:47,279
maybe december are middle of next year

00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,730
right you you can't nail them down on

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,260
that you have to be flexible with it

00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,390
things you don't want to do if you're a

00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:58,140
user you don't want to berate the

00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:59,880
community especially publicity right

00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:03,060
there may be people out there that

00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:05,430
really grind your gears are twist you

00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,779
the wrong way but but shaming someone

00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,980
publicly is about the worst thing you

00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:10,440
can do if you want to get someone to

00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,199
help you in the future try not to

00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,990
complain without offering a solution

00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:17,910
right if there is a problem point out

00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:20,610
the problem is fine but it's even better

00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:24,380
if you can say one way to fix this would

00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:27,810
be and define what that way to fix it is

00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:31,470
another phrase we like to use is assume

00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:35,730
positive intent most people are really

00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:37,200
not out there to get you right you may

00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,380
be paranoid but it's not always

00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,750
true don't interpret someone's bad

00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,750
action like putting a bug in their not

00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,580
trying to drive your business to him now

00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,650
there's always exceptions that prove the

00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:52,110
rule but generally ninety-nine percent

00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:56,900
of the time someone is not out to get

00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:56,900
you they're not trying to hurt you okay

00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:02,370
second level of commitment to open

00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,990
source is being a contributor you get to

00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,579
give back to the community you get to

00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:07,650
add something to of course you got to be

00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:08,940
a coder or another participant in the

00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:12,930
community there's lots of things you can

00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:16,530
do to contribute you get that ability to

00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:18,390
add features and bugs right in rackspace

00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,850
we started out a couple of years ago

00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:23,579
with no sort of SDKs to use with our

00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:25,920
software that was coming so some of them

00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:28,079
we built from scratch others we jumped

00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:32,010
into the existing community so Apache

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,650
Jay clouds is a multi cloud library we

00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:36,570
jumped on board with that we have three

00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,640
people that work with Jay clouds there

00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:41,250
now three official committers on Jay

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,160
clouds and one of them is in fact sort

00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,780
of the de facto leader of it since the

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,010
other leader Adrian Cole had to leave

00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:50,190
and go to work somewhere they didn't let

00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:52,800
him work on it so effectively we're now

00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,930
able to have much more control over that

00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,220
simply by contributing and giving our

00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:59,640
code back to the rest of the community

00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:02,130
there that gives us the influence the

00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,010
guidance and stuff it certainly gives us

00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,990
advance notice of changes Jay clouds

00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:09,000
another great example they recently came

00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:13,250
out with a 1.8 release which dropped

00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,480
support for java 6 right we knew that

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:18,660
well probably a year before anyone else

00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,970
did but the fact is java 6 is old and

00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:24,450
outmoded and was deprecated a couple

00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:25,860
years ago itself but a lot of people

00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:27,300
were caught by surprise because they're

00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,120
still running it in production and I

00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:32,820
can't say who they are but some very

00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:35,820
large companies you get advance notice

00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,740
by contributing to this you get actually

00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,390
some support for integration because you

00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:42,570
have a community there you can talk to

00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:44,550
and if you're a contributor you can help

00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:47,940
align that community with your business

00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:48,790
objectives right so that's all those

00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,240
sort of benefits you

00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:54,940
yet they're still paying with it there's

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,010
not all is everything not everything is

00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,770
perfect right you still don't have

00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:02,500
control over release schedules as much

00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:05,080
as you might like to if you're doing

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,030
this right your business needs cannot

00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,550
Trump the needs of the open source

00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:12,370
community right we all we like to use

00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:14,070
the phrase upstream first if you're

00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:16,480
working with an open source project

00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:19,210
you're much better off to help the

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,620
community first and then focus on your

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,110
business needs if you go in there and

00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:25,150
try to force your business needs to take

00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,530
over the community one you're probably

00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,450
going to fail to you're going to turn

00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:33,040
people against you and it's going to

00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:34,780
make it a lot harder down the road when

00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,330
you're in an open source community that

00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:40,060
means there are other contributors they

00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:42,480
can change things sometimes they can

00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:44,320
change things that you've fixed

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,270
sometimes they can change things that

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,440
you fixed without warning and you're

00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,540
able to get someone else to approve

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,060
their check-in you have to sort of learn

00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:54,100
to live with that and if there is a

00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:59,910
benevolent dictator for life you all

00:19:54,100 --> 00:20:01,870
heard that turd the term right btfl okay

00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,250
sometimes that person doesn't want to

00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,570
help right they've got their other

00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:07,660
objectives they're working for someone

00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:12,190
else right you get you got to get in

00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:15,760
there and sort of negotiate and motivate

00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:18,100
to do the things you want so if you're

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,470
going to manage a project that uses open

00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,720
source in your contributor you want to

00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:25,120
commit to supporting the upstream folks

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,950
before the business that's really key

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,900
and I've seen that succeed in a number

00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:34,930
of ways mainly because people then sort

00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:38,190
of trust you that you have the community

00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:43,240
at heart and not your own business right

00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:44,770
developers tend to be very reactionary

00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,550
if they think someone is trying to

00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:52,120
manipulate them right they don't like it

00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:53,830
at all one of the things you know I work

00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,080
for rackspace I make no secret of that

00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,640
but I'm not going to come here and tell

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,910
you you have to buy Rackspace or why you

00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,410
should write there's a number of option

00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:03,300
out there I'm happy to talk with them

00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:05,910
but that's not my goal here my goal is

00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:08,190
to empower you so that you can look at

00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:10,020
the world and make the right decisions

00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:13,740
whatever those end up to be because then

00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:16,470
we'll all be happier document the

00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,600
dependencies one of the things I've

00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,220
hated about some open source project is

00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,710
you go to the landing page and it says

00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,290
get up and running with this project

00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:27,600
with two lines of code you type in the

00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:32,400
first line of code and it says command

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:34,290
not found right well you can get up and

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,580
running if you're an existing developer

00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:37,230
and if you have the infrastructure built

00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,660
in and if you have these 45 other

00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:42,000
packages that all Ruby developers have

00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:44,280
installed on their system have then yes

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,370
it works fine but know if you're coming

00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:50,880
at it from scratch it fails my first

00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:53,010
interaction there was it didn't work I

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,310
can't trust anything I get right first

00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:59,490
impressions are very important so so

00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:02,580
commit to that dependency management is

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:04,350
a pain but but documented as well I've

00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,990
tried to get this across to my team

00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:10,380
where someone has to be able to go to

00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:12,780
our website and be able to start from

00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,370
nothing and getting a system operate up

00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,770
and operational using the instructions

00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:20,190
we give them we can't assume that they

00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:22,230
have anything else installed there you

00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:24,960
need to commit to testing and doing the

00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:26,580
docs as well as development open source

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,620
docs like what you said are sometimes

00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:32,370
great with so often they're the under

00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:36,330
looked part of the project and that

00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:38,220
means down the road the project will do

00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,990
badly because it's poorly documented if

00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,850
you have that commitment to doing the

00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:46,710
documentation up front you can influence

00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:49,440
that and finally again flexible and

00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:51,180
schedules right if you've got a person

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,420
out there who's delivering a key

00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:57,330
component of this open source package

00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:58,560
and she has appendicitis well you're

00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:00,420
going to have to defer that for a month

00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:05,220
or two right it's not going to happen

00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:07,890
maybe the time you expected it do's and

00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:10,650
don'ts finally don't commit to things

00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:13,120
you can't deliver you know there's a few

00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:15,640
things worse than someone submitting a

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,809
a bug report or an issue and saying I

00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,550
need this desperately and you say oh

00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:22,350
sure no problem and then realizing it's

00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:24,910
much bigger and then you can't do it

00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:28,210
again never be publicly critical of

00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:30,730
anyone this some of this by the way is

00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:32,860
just sort of common sense courtesy by

00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:35,500
the witch which is sadly lacking in the

00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:37,300
anonymity of the Internet so hopefully

00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,100
that'll be a good reminder but but

00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,570
shaming people publicly is almost never

00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:45,640
the best way to get them to do something

00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:47,140
for you don't engage the trolls and the

00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,910
worst thing I've ever seen is someone to

00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,400
go dark and silent have a key

00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:54,130
contributor on a project and then

00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,850
suddenly you get nothing from them no

00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:58,750
response to email you don't know if they

00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:03,280
you know we're murdered in their sleep

00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:04,720
or if they had a car accident or if

00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,700
they've just gotten bored with it and

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,100
went on to something else if you're

00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:17,290
going to can't be there let people know

00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:20,830
about it okay next level up open source

00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:22,990
owners you're the folks that sort of

00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:25,630
need this you build it you get other

00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:28,480
people to engage in rackspace for

00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:30,730
example we built our PHP SDK from

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,980
scratch so we're the owners of that

00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:36,880
whereas with Jay clouds we're a

00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:41,920
participant in an existing community so

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:44,070
open source owners get karma right we're

00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:48,670
any of you hear from mic session earlier

00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:51,820
What did he say about karma yeah it goes

00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:54,640
both ways you get better control over

00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:56,320
releases bug fixes you get to sort of

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,480
choose what goes in you get to choose

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,059
who participates in it you get to choose

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,470
which patches you accept and reject you

00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:04,929
know if someone submits something that

00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:07,900
uses three spaces of indentation instead

00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:10,900
of the god-given then you can reject

00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:14,920
that out of hand you can set the product

00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:17,260
roadmap you can own things you define

00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:19,390
how this gets integrated and you since

00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,310
you're doing it you have the SOA and

00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:24,040
liability that you need to provide but

00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:26,060
it's all on your shoulders downside of

00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:29,630
course is karma

00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:31,670
right if you do this wrong it's going to

00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:35,030
come back and bite you and I guarantee

00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:37,250
that you have a responsibility actually

00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:40,250
to the community the idea of community

00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:45,470
first or upstream first doesn't change

00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:48,800
just because you on the project now bad

00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:52,460
decisions can really seriously ruin a

00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,410
company's reputation I know there have

00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,150
been a couple of major ones in the last

00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:58,850
year to that don't come to mind right

00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:01,840
now part of getting older is your memory

00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:05,660
does something that I forget what it is

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,910
security issues what have you on openssl

00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:10,610
and introduced the heartbleed bug to the

00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:11,870
world right that's that's one of the

00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,060
risks you take when you're being an

00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,920
owner of an open source project is

00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:19,430
having some of that come back to haunt

00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:22,430
you in the future if you're an honor an

00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:26,120
owner you need to be responsive to the

00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:29,560
community one of our rules that we have

00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,490
is we always accept pull requests right

00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:33,560
there's nothing worse than having

00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,360
something sort of arbitrarily rejected

00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:38,150
right up front when you're trying to get

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,040
someone engaged we may go in immediately

00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:42,650
after emerging the pull request and

00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:47,390
adding fixes to it but we love to have

00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:49,760
the contributions there don't play

00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:51,950
favorites you know your contributors are

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,570
valuable you may have one person that's

00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:55,220
brand new and the newbie and they've

00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:58,040
just submitted a one-line fix for a

00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:59,570
small bug that should get as much

00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:03,350
attention as the guy who's been working

00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:05,810
on it three years and has solved some

00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:10,550
major issues for you it helps to grow

00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:14,240
the community this away don't be that

00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:16,160
guy right we've all probably known

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,590
someone like that and worked with them I

00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,900
see a couple people here smiling you you

00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:24,650
you got people in mind you know who that

00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:26,690
guy is and you have actually a

00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:29,390
responsibility as an owner to provide

00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,920
that extra layer of security so if

00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:32,690
you're an open source own or you should

00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,270
be the one who is testing it for

00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,820
penetration for security for memory

00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,530
overflow

00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,530
is for doing all of that right you have

00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:42,090
an obligation not only to your community

00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,620
but also to your company because you've

00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:45,120
got that additional risk of having your

00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:49,470
company's name associated with some

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:51,690
problem that comes up don't push people

00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:53,280
these are one of the great things about

00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:57,860
being an owner of this is you get people

00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,860
doing work for you for free right

00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:02,280
OpenStack has a component called heat

00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:03,870
which does orchestration and it'll

00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,010
create you know you give it a recipe and

00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:07,260
it'll create a whole bunch of

00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,730
infrastructure all at once and that was

00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,290
on our road map but no one had touched

00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,000
it and then someone came along and

00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:13,980
actually submitted a complete

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,070
implementation to our library for it oh

00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,600
my god that's wonderful they've done all

00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,910
this work which probably two or three

00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:25,590
months worked for one of us and they

00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:27,210
gave it to us for free right don't be a

00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:32,730
jerk we already said that last time

00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:35,250
right in the last session a couple of

00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:41,040
random tips if you're an open source

00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:43,800
leader or owner Mike said this 24 hours

00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,500
48 hours for a pull request fully agree

00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,290
with that be responsive even if you

00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,610
can't merge it or do something with it

00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:52,860
respond to it and say thank you very

00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:55,200
much for your contribution I'm on

00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:58,830
vacation in Bora Bora at the moment or

00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,000
on a secret mission for the CIA and you

00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,300
know I'll get back to you when I'm done

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,270
with this you do have to behave with

00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:08,220
sensitivity and without hostility again

00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:10,320
these people really are not out to get

00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:12,240
you they really are trying to help now

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,680
I'll qualify that and say there are

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,790
trolls and pundits and we'll get to that

00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:22,410
when we go to the next section here set

00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:23,610
up continuous integration Mike said

00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:26,120
there's three things you need source

00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:29,190
code control issue tracking and

00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:30,930
automated testing right so set that up

00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,520
you have an obligation to do that to

00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,840
help things out if someone submits bad

00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,550
code they should know it immediately

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:40,050
they shouldn't have to wait for a week

00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:43,110
or two to find that have some really

00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:45,870
simple and useful contribution

00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:48,160
guidelines if you go to the github

00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:51,130
repository for PHP open cloud

00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,230
there's a contributing doc in the root

00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:56,710
directory that you can read it should

00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:58,720
tell people how they set up to use this

00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:01,630
how they can test it what they need to

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,090
do to run it you know the fact that we

00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:06,220
want people to submit new new pull

00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:07,660
requests to the working branch not to

00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:10,180
the master branch all those sort of

00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:13,260
little things tell people up front point

00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,260
them that away if they want to help

00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:21,910
tests hugely important the more tests

00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:25,570
you have we like to encourage people not

00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:27,280
to submit without tests but but like I

00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,720
said we'll jibley merge stuff will

00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,210
always comment on and say we need to

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:35,140
have tests with this when they do the

00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:36,580
code submission have a style guide you

00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,170
know the guy that rejected something

00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,330
because it had indentation of three

00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:43,510
verses for that should be documented

00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:46,390
some more somewhere and if you can that

00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:48,430
should be automated testing right so

00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:49,840
they're Lintz and compilers and tests

00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:52,180
for every language out there that will

00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,710
enforce a style guide for you you know

00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,660
if you want your braces on the next line

00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:59,740
so they line up versus at the end of the

00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:02,410
previous line be clear about it right in

00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:06,400
but but be reasonable with people as

00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:08,710
well I love having vanity badges that

00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,000
show people care you know give someone a

00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,800
badge that they can display on their

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,170
site that says I've submitted five pull

00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:18,070
request to this or fixed a thousand

00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:19,780
lines of code or something the

00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:22,060
helpfulness of the community is is the

00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,230
biggest thing you can do bill that will

00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:26,020
help you out in making this thing

00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:32,730
successful and fundamentally it boils

00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:32,730
down to respecting people finally

00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:43,780
mocking the hem that has feed you and no

00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:47,850
I'm not kidding everyone anyone know who

00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:50,320
clay sirki is clay shirky is a sort of

00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:54,250
technology writer and author and thinker

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:57,520
I attended a talk he gave a few years

00:31:54,250 --> 00:32:00,100
ago where he said there's three classes

00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,720
of problems that an engineer faces right

00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,600
for the first of these is that

00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:06,460
engineering problem right you don't know

00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,530
how to do this so you solve it those are

00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,600
the trivial ones you know if you're a

00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:12,580
writer of code you solve those all the

00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:16,510
time the second one of the managerial

00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:19,150
problems right I need a specialized type

00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:21,190
of machine to test this on I need three

00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:22,270
extra people to help me get this testing

00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,820
done or else I'm not going to get it

00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:26,500
done by the deadline I need people with

00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:29,140
a specific set of skills to develop the

00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,550
front end of this right those are

00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,650
something that a manager can help you

00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:34,360
with you push it up the chain usually it

00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,440
involves spending money but it's not an

00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,140
engineering problem you're not going to

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:43,030
write some code to solve that the third

00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:44,170
one are the political issues right what

00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:47,560
you have to understand about the

00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:49,840
political issues is that the code and

00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,580
the software and the open source project

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,740
is utterly and completely irrelevant to

00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:55,750
those what's happening in a political

00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:58,260
situation is people trying to establish

00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:00,610
dominance or control over a group and

00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,870
the actual net result of how the code

00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:04,210
goes or something is really irrelevant

00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:06,730
to it you need to be aware that those

00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:09,280
exist if you're not good at the Pollock

00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:12,610
six-game asked for help if that's

00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:14,140
happening in your project there are

00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:15,730
people out there who will use open

00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:20,770
source software to stifle competition

00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:23,020
right OpenStack has its own API but it

00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:25,720
also ships with a secondary Amazon

00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:28,000
compatible API that you can install if

00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:30,280
you like well there was a key member of

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,560
the OpenStack technical committee who

00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:36,450
advocated last year that that should in

00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:40,600
fact be the only API that OpenStack

00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:42,040
should ship with it was the de facto

00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,750
standard because the world was using

00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:48,150
Amazon and just putting our resources

00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:50,920
into this other AP I was sort of useless

00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:53,050
right that's a position anyone to sort

00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:55,720
of take but when you understand that he

00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:58,600
runs a consulting business whose job it

00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,400
is to install AWS compatible api's for

00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,690
people's customers you can sort of

00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,870
understand better what his true

00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:07,990
motivations are right in other words his

00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:10,150
motivation was his own business and not

00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:12,580
the success of the OpenStack open source

00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:16,540
community there

00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:18,280
they need to be directly managed you

00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:21,640
know they need to be reached out to and

00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:23,560
I think again Mike suggestion of having

00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,910
a code of conduct is easily the best one

00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,000
there that you have to be prepared to

00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:30,700
enforce right have it documented how you

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,400
expect people to behave you know

00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:35,830
document examples of misbehavior and

00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,360
then ban or get rid of the people that

00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:41,620
are not behaving in accordance with your

00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:43,360
community's policies do not simply

00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:45,610
ignore them because they can do a heck

00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:48,070
of a lot of damage I feel bad that I

00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:49,810
have to even include this right because

00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:51,700
there's so much open source work that is

00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:53,440
really just a bunch of people doing some

00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:57,040
really cool stuff and getting excited to

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,690
share it but unfortunately there's a ton

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,000
of money out there behind some of these

00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:05,680
and that will make people do all sorts

00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,540
of strange and weird things how many

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,410
people or managers have people working

00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:15,240
for you any of you a couple okay you

00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:15,240
don't have to be shy I'm a manager too

00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:21,940
if you use an open source project you

00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:24,640
don't have people working for you that

00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:27,250
don't actually work for you right

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,440
they're doing work on your benefit for

00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:32,590
it for your benefit but you're not

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:38,410
paying them so it's a bit of a strange

00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:41,860
relationship communication is really key

00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:44,260
for these folks software developers

00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,600
especially thrive on recognition so

00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:48,730
calling folks out publicly for the great

00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:52,450
things they did is it is hugely useful

00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:56,230
tool to help keep them motivated direct

00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:58,630
incentives right like I said you buying

00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:00,280
someone an Android tablet will go long

00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:02,650
ways to get them in your camp and help

00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,120
to help you out find out what motivates

00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:06,220
those folks some of them are doing this

00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,630
because it's their job and it's

00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:10,210
important for them to have some of these

00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:11,920
features others just really like the

00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:16,930
community aspect and they really want to

00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:18,790
be feel a part of it the recognition and

00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:22,000
I can't emphasize that enough you know

00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:24,370
finally you like the last one there

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,920
I no longer have to work on the PHP

00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:28,480
library that I started because we had

00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,130
this kid from London who suddenly

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,660
started doing all sorts of contributions

00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:34,510
and stuff so i called him up one day and

00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:36,550
said really a lot of the work you're

00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:38,140
doing it's great I'd like to buy you an

00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:40,720
Android tablet or hire you which would

00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:44,980
you be your choice so he now works for

00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:47,170
me because he's a software developer and

00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:48,520
not doing what it used to be doing he's

00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,980
now getting paid about three times what

00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:53,800
he was paid then so he's a very very

00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:55,750
happy employee and he gets to do what he

00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:59,350
was enjoying doing right he keeps going

00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:02,770
on with it it's been really strange in

00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:07,480
my position managing these SDKs that are

00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:08,890
all open source because we now get to

00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,680
hire people that have actually been

00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:13,450
writing on are working on our code it's

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,580
really rare to actually have someone

00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:18,910
interview that hasn't already

00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:22,150
contributed to one of our projects what

00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:23,170
other business can say that right that

00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:27,270
you're only going to hire people that

00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:29,860
have already been working for you right

00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:33,120
it's a marvelous situation to be in a

00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:36,070
very very high quality state of being

00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:39,610
I've really never had it so easy to put

00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:40,930
a team together you know set the

00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:43,810
expectations we talked about this a

00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:46,870
little bit before for for style for a

00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:48,220
unit test documentation example code you

00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:51,340
know if they've been there awhile point

00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:54,760
out to them that it's not done until the

00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:58,240
docs are done as well deadlines are

00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:03,580
great hard to enforce right and then

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:05,350
finally spend some money on them if you

00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:07,420
go to up to a conference you know have a

00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:08,740
meetup or a party or go buy drinks for

00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:13,090
everyone that contributed to your

00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:16,270
project it will cost far less by the way

00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:18,250
to do that then it will to actually hire

00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:21,190
the people to have done it for yourself

00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:23,140
so that doesn't always help with the

00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,370
accounting people at work who wonder

00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:27,790
what you while you're spending all this

00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:31,240
money on strangers but measure the

00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:32,740
success you know if you don't measure

00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,350
something then basically you don't care

00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:37,740
about it so so keep up with

00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:41,940
recognition and stuff they're finally

00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:43,560
here some other things you can do let

00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:47,310
your developers support other open

00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:50,280
source projects Rackspace has an open

00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:52,160
source policy for allowing our employees

00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:55,560
to participate on open-source projects

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,170
it is an open source open source policy

00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,580
in that it's stored under github and you

00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:01,350
can actually if you want to change how

00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,820
we have our policy about open source

00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:04,770
contributions you can go do a pull

00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,180
request against it it'll get reviewed by

00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:09,390
our lawyers and decide where the puddle

00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:10,950
go in but people who like doing this

00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:14,850
sort of thing that's a huge motivator

00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:17,510
for them if they work for you I

00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:19,920
encourage people to have side projects

00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:22,950
the coolest things happen when people

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:26,510
are just sort of playing around I've got

00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:30,000
one guy that works for me who likes

00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:32,940
ipython you feel ipython scientific

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,160
computing notebooks and things there's a

00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,990
project they have called Jupiter which

00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:40,110
is basically multi-tenancy ipython

00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:42,240
notebooks and he thought you know I bet

00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:45,060
this would be faster if I ran it on bare

00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,770
metal instead of a cloud server and so

00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,180
he started using Rackspace as an

00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:51,120
offering called on metal which lets you

00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:52,440
spin up a bare metal server and suddenly

00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,790
he realized by putting a docker

00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,320
container around each of these he can

00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:59,880
spend them up in less than a tenth of a

00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:02,610
second each so it was about 20 lines of

00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:05,490
code initially that let him do this it's

00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:07,650
now grown a little bit but we've gotten

00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:09,960
new customers because of it he's got

00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:13,200
invited to talk at o'reilly strata he

00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,240
got invited to talk to ma's fast over in

00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,490
London this week he's giving an

00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:20,160
interview with nature magazine on how

00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:21,990
this helps scientific computing this is

00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,550
all a huge benefit to my company just

00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,990
because he was playing around on

00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:27,540
something that actually wasn't in the

00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:32,010
stuff he was supposed to be doing right

00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:35,040
it's brilliant the PR people are looking

00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:37,080
at this going oh well on the PR side

00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,500
that's about 5 million dollars worth of

00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:42,750
publicity we've just gotten for free

00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:45,460
right the sales people know that he's

00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:48,250
already brought in enough new

00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:51,190
customers and new signups there to pay

00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:53,170
his salary five times over that came out

00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:54,940
of him playing around with a little side

00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:57,010
project just because it was something he

00:40:54,940 --> 00:41:01,750
enjoyed and like to do and because we

00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:03,160
let him do that so conferences y'all

00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:06,760
enjoy going to conferences hopefully you

00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:08,920
do right everyone does encourage them to

00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,839
submit you know go off we do that all

00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,060
the time of course that's partly our job

00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:14,800
you know to get out in front of people

00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,750
and convince them that we're not idiots

00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:21,000
I hope I'm doing intuitive job at that

00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:23,530
but building the community I'm going to

00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,800
defer a lot to my koi he's just such a

00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:28,240
good job with this we've talked about

00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,330
some of this and I'm just going to skip

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:35,890
over it I will emphasize again the code

00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:37,270
of conduct right you need to show you

00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:40,300
need to spank what the expected

00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:44,230
behaviors are you need to state what the

00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:47,369
consequences of ill behavior are and you

00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:50,530
need to be prepared to enforce it right

00:41:47,369 --> 00:41:52,599
it's no coincidence that I feel this way

00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:54,430
when a number of people on my team were

00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:55,780
actually the folks that run PyCon over

00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:58,240
the last few years that sort of

00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:02,290
established this as a standard within

00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,810
the industry the ADA initiative has a

00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:07,240
great blog post on how to design a code

00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:12,970
of conduct if you have a community an

00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:16,540
open source project start there right I

00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:19,800
used to have the opinion last year we

00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:21,880
were talking about telling potential

00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,260
events we were sponsoring that we

00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,300
wouldn't sponsor them without a code of

00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:29,080
conduct and I made the argument at the

00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:31,390
time that we don't have enough influence

00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,530
right us withholding a few thousand

00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:34,869
dollars from an event is not going to

00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:36,790
make them change things I've actually

00:42:34,869 --> 00:42:40,300
sort of switched position on that I now

00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:41,890
think we need to be doing that more we

00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,150
need to encourage people to have the

00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:46,570
right behaviors and have the code of

00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:50,369
conducts its really interesting to see

00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:52,210
what happens we mentioned this to a

00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:54,580
conference in Europe that we are

00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:56,620
sponsoring and they said well we don't

00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:59,710
really need it we never had a problem

00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:01,180
right and so we said what percentage of

00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:03,690
the attendees at your events are women

00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:05,740
they said well probably less than 2%

00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:09,010
well that to me sounds like a problem

00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:10,510
right we're keeping half the people we

00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:12,460
should have their away from these

00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:17,490
conferences we need to have a way to

00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:17,490
encourage them and to get involved in it

00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:23,230
hopefully we got a few minutes yell 249

00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:26,730
so I'm going to end it on this any

00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:26,730
questions yeah

00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:46,910
so the question is about hiring people

00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:49,250
from the community can actually leave a

00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:50,810
gap in the community I think you have to

00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,880
make the right decisions they're right

00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:54,710
in our case we were growing and we

00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,780
needed someone that dedicated to this I

00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:58,130
was moving into a management role it

00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:59,720
happened we had had someone who had been

00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:01,490
contributing there you're absolutely

00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:05,330
right some people may be more valuable

00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:06,260
to you as a community member then if you

00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:10,280
hire them and bring them on board

00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:12,050
directly right well you can't hire olive

00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,060
I don't think you ever could but that

00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:18,670
may be a good source of people when you

00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:18,670
do need to hire yeah

00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:28,070
the guy I mentioned was actually based

00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:29,750
in London he wanted to work on the

00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:31,550
continent so he moved himself to Zurich

00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,230
and he's working there and I actually

00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:34,490
wanted to be in Germany but we didn't

00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:36,080
have an office in Germany so now he's

00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:40,150
moving to Berlin next month when we open

00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:43,099
up an office so yes it has some issues

00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:45,470
in fact in within my company Rackspace

00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:46,940
UK and Rackspace us are actually

00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:49,250
different business entities and they

00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:53,900
have different rules and procedures so

00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:56,030
that causes some minor issues I think if

00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,859
I were to go into another country where

00:44:56,030 --> 00:45:00,349
we didn't have a business presence that

00:44:57,859 --> 00:45:02,210
would be nearly impossible because we

00:45:00,349 --> 00:45:03,410
have to pay income taxes and things and

00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:05,839
if we don't have a business presence

00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:12,070
that would stop it so but it's certainly

00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:12,070
possible any other question yeah

00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:21,560
is 45

00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:23,990
it's not

00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:27,860
none of our actually none of our sdk

00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:30,800
code at rackspace all of our production

00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:33,170
code is based on OpenStack but we have

00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,670
code on the back end for integration

00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:36,680
with our billing and customer

00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:39,170
relationship systems and that is kept

00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:42,140
proprietary right we don't want to open

00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:45,340
the kimono for how we process credit

00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:45,340
card payments for example

00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:01,499
primary

00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:08,860
we have a policy that if it's not

00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:12,670
dealing with customer data or financials

00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:15,340
we can open source it and that the goal

00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:17,560
is to be open source by default the

00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:19,240
bigger issue is actually the cultural

00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,670
one and that people are not used to this

00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:24,220
and they're very nervous about being

00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:26,080
open source so a year and a half ago I

00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:28,870
went talk with the docks people the

00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:30,070
right our documentation and and I said

00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:31,780
why don't you open source our

00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:34,480
documentation just put it on github that

00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:36,700
way if someone sees a problem they can

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,530
fix it you got people working for and

00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:40,090
they're like but this would be giving

00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:41,740
away new features and things in advance

00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:45,580
that's coming and people could learn

00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:47,770
stuff and my response was OpenStack has

00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:50,200
a conference twice a year every six

00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:51,490
months with five to six thousand people

00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,140
where they plan out what new features

00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:54,220
are coming what what are the pups

00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:56,380
possibly going to get from our

00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:59,650
documentation that they couldn't get

00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:02,470
from that so yes if there's a fear of

00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:04,330
releasing something that probably needs

00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:07,170
to be controlled but really more of it

00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:14,470
it's more than just a fear than actual

00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:16,570
problem there any other questions I like

00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:18,880

00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:21,460
