the final by this room another happens

00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:33,200
give them and they will deal my name is

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:35,059
mike martin for some college this talk

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,300
is bugging bigfoot is system the houses

00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:45,500
for the performance co-pilot to see you

00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:49,940
and have a yield back so this is a

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:53,989
sovereign here at performance tools in

00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:56,180
here the German a new system stop this

00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:58,430
work is included enabling systems have

00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,579
to baby-proof job programs as well as

00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:04,070
adding performance PDI metrics

00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:07,970
superfluous co-pilot abigail is an

00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:10,280
intern at for the 2014-2015 turn where

00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,960
we go system tab for contributions to

00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,149
systems that vary between but that

00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:18,670
language features and optimization so

00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:18,670
please join me in welcoming Tommy visit

00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:26,050
you can make for their introductions so

00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:30,190
like you mentioned my name is Lucas

00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:33,110
enter our engineer down from slinky and

00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:36,080
we talking about the phones copilot and

00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:37,970
it's a toolkit which will allow you to

00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:45,580
very easily grab a beverage from the

00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:51,040
entire system so we'll have construction

00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:51,040
no photo pilot

00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,560
so analyzing performance how do you

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,290
usually eat it straight on the various

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,750
box you know first thing you might look

00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:16,140
at its various logging form so far six

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:18,180
logs its logic generation Gerald E all

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,250
the pros and cons maybe you know like

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:24,690
pattern but it's very much after the

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:28,650
fact you've got your sis tools right I

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,030
talked to us that you know they're great

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,640
tools but they're not very flexible

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,230
right there profile until tell you what

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,880
they're designed to tell you and you

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,360
wanting more of it or to change how they

00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,610
presented to it's not very useful

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,740
realistically especially devops and hops

00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,470
there's a mixture of scripting languages

00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,360
rate bash or on without you and those

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,890
are more of a black magic that science

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,950
right they're not easily reproducible

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,360
and you might pass down a script to

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,140
another engineer but they might never

00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,900
use it and yeah realistically specific

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,910
tools very poor platform I love for

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,010
letting everywhere but realistically

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,900
it's not cheap pop users perhaps using a

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:11,209
windows box would be I've heard about or

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:14,130
Mac OS and it's a heterogeneous learn

00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:15,880
yes the proper analysis requires more

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,880
contacts that a lot of

00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:22,360
traditional tools allow you so

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,810
introducing performance profile key

00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:28,090
points of interest right it's a toolkit

00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,940
all right big lies they will stand ago

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:34,050
do one thing well and do well and you'll

00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,520
see that throughout the overview of it

00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,230
and complements existing system

00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,210
functionality and this is a big one

00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,950
because you'll never get a systems

00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,450
administrator running away faster than

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,390
telling them you're going to relearn

00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:49,630
this is not gonna happen so we're very

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:53,410
gentle if I the overlaying you applies

00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:55,630
what you want where you want it cross

00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:59,530
platform on it riginal around and I are

00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:02,100
so is joining our SGI sorry and when it

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:05,950
runs on linux windows command revised

00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:08,590
BSP I made sure that it maintains that

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:11,650
ability and there's consistent

00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:13,120
measurement throughout the toolkit if

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,310
you just have a number sitting out of

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,560
you that doesn't mean it why you need to

00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:20,850
know is it killed by the second is it

00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,980
gigabytes of it let's have some context

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:25,030
and it's extremely extensible this is

00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,830
something i'm going to point out

00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:30,570
multiple points gender presentation at

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:33,040
how you can extend and it's open source

00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,350
good background it actually wasn't the

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,849
original open source SGI open source it

00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,610
after the developed

00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:42,129
tenure so it's a great example how I

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:46,300
project candy come up the source and

00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:48,459
still successful at it and that's GI of

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,229
you know will super something when

00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:52,990
they're originally designing this they

00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:55,149
kept the fact that it's running on high

00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:59,039
for computers in mind and decide the

00:04:55,149 --> 00:05:01,689
data structures compliment that and so

00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:04,919
on any given is from scope out of the

00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:07,779
set up you're not to underlying posts

00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:10,269
for symmetric remain agent that's about

00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:12,009
full but that's what actually talks to

00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:13,599
what you're interested in I'll say your

00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:14,860
student very statistics are going to

00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,050
have one of those guys for vendor

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,449
statistics one for the network right

00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,819
it's very specific about what a machine

00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:24,519
you're going to have it's our only one

00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:26,019
of the prometric collection data and

00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:28,449
that's one of those how to talk to the

00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:29,949
agents right there's only one letter the

00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:31,839
end of the agents but we're going to

00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:34,899
simplify that it's simply going to be

00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,759
the agents and pmc my lies exciting

00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:39,259
social me

00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:43,099
so this is what I didn't get a machine I

00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:45,409
look like right let's get a end 11 p.m.

00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:47,300
city than all the various agents have

00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:49,429
installed I love to have an

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,289
application-specific because we know

00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:52,999
what's important for you to measure we

00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:55,819
might not acknowledge that we don't know

00:05:52,999 --> 00:06:00,439
what program you're right so that's

00:05:55,819 --> 00:06:02,389
where you fit so just out of curiosity

00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:05,509
right how many number or how many

00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:07,879
metrics are exposed by default pullers a

00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:11,089
lot on money defaulted or install about

00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:12,079
fifteen hundred different metrics so

00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:14,360
that presents some unique challenges

00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:17,329
right here somebody give you things you

00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,939
can measure how do you categorize and

00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:24,139
there's a huge variation somebody I'm

00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:27,769
statistics some might be a volume if it

00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:30,469
doesn't all be actually the with it so

00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:32,839
have you reliably and predictably mean I

00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:34,489
want one user to know what they're

00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:37,129
measuring and it make sense to the next

00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:40,129
user of the next this event it needs to

00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:42,979
work yet so our answer to that is the

00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:46,099
foremost metric Mason and it's a higher

00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:47,639
galini's right we start with the

00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:50,699
subsystem and working

00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:53,360
be more specific part veteran as an

00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:56,460
example because this might go full slide

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,229
but if I was interested in looking at

00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:02,069
the number of packets that are so you go

00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:06,900
to network of TCP protocol I would say

00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:09,930
the metric name is network PCP powder c5

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:12,240
like fairly simple its report give you

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:16,050
things like syscalls per cpu right no

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,090
it's Colonel dot per cpu on cisco so

00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:21,330
that's all it all fits together from a

00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:23,189
Nene perspective so how do you make use

00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:25,800
of all this we're going to go back this

00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:28,080
time there are several times but on the

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,840
flip side of things all right agents

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,580
phed and you're going to have these

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,189
tools various tools and all the

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,349
different things again use light

00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:40,319
component design all these tools

00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:43,439
presente see you in a different way that

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,409
you want to see it so the imbalance of

00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,629
the current value statistic can find is

00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:52,320
to electric flying machines on american

00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:55,570
rifleman profiler team in Baltimore

00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,520
and all this can be done over network so

00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:00,430
these tools do not have to run on the

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,860
same machine let it run DMC it allows

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:07,140
when your biggest gathering information

00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:09,490
older systems right so we're just start

00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:12,010
in one place is starting to beat to a

00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,890
pulp chemical and it simply displays

00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:17,950
information about imaginary people so

00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:19,780
let's say it's like p.m. info kashti all

00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:22,360
that's going to do is go to the left

00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:26,080
knee a short bit of health effects then

00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,420
describe that by default right 1,500

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,300
metric system display a lot so what you

00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:35,620
can do is you narrow down / subsystem so

00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:38,530
say if you do kinfolk dashti aki get a

00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:41,500
list of all the packing metrics but

00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:44,410
something your small online papel fest

00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,240
we actually can quickly see graph sick

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:50,339
its graphical cycles

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:53,020
so I bought this metric a major soon 10

00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:56,830
welcome bow another tool back in the

00:08:53,020 --> 00:09:01,029
chart folks like current event so say I

00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:02,709
want the total six is called and one

00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:06,130
thing I do point out before display the

00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:08,950
up boys notice I'm ready to go we do

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:10,660
respect access control lists parametric

00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,930
laser machine that money be sensitive

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:17,260
you will respect that I know that proper

00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:19,870
users access those values so I get to

00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,839
this connector you get the metadata

00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,880
right you the metric nature what else is

00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:27,730
running on again this is throwing tired

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,339
network and how can we present it to you

00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:32,350
right so in this case it's a cold

00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:34,779
encounter and it's just going to convert

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:38,050
to a rate per second you can change that

00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:40,180
sampling rate for different clients they

00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,529
decided but this is my default and

00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,390
simply once a second that's going to

00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:48,160
type 0 well this is the greatest

00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:50,770
changing those people so cool you basic

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,079
starting point we're going to focus on

00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:56,220
one tool now called pin water

00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:59,430
like I mentioned before logging is

00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,829
useful right it's been used for ages so

00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,319
this to all it knows is take a specific

00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:05,459
set of metrics you're interested in

00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:09,240
different hopes as really easy to set up

00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:11,550
and it spits out archives will log them

00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,519
for you and what that will do is you can

00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,839
bend these archives in tools it'll treat

00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,559
them like live data so you can

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,660
historical evidence right so basically

00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:25,110
p.m. water breaks logs or future

00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,369
analysis it's important to be able to

00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,980
look back on what happened especially

00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:31,050
say you're just an went down what was

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,819
the current state assistant for half a

00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,420
lot of times you look at failure points

00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:37,980
if they can slow down and by default

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,240
that's a question I get all the time how

00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:43,079
much space does it take up right how

00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,869
much how much realization are using and

00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:48,749
the answers 1 505 sad a rotating press

00:10:45,869 --> 00:10:51,569
for you but no if you do want to lock

00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:54,300
more might take up more and it's

00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:56,189
organized right I hear some more storage

00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,410
people driving a whole bunch of metrics

00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:59,999
from their systems in no way organize it

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,780
they stuff into elasticsearch chillin

00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:02,910
search earlier

00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:06,060
and when the terms and I thought these

00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:07,800
disk usage issues were I'm a body marker

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,290
we don't want to have that problem for

00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:14,490
you it's it's easy to organize is easy

00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:16,350
to look up so few recent developments a

00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,360
few develops work going we're going to

00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:21,120
explain how these big package for Miss

00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:26,310
co-pilot we're very difficult we have a

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:31,230
packet va va bien wet beat and even this

00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:34,280
seeker system inter special so we pull

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,280
up the side here through

00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:41,660
so I hate quotes up from the car

00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,510
uncredited

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,280
if we're running joke aside cache

00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,140
invalidation is an issue that people

00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,940
encounter on systems right you know

00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:53,930
affect your performance and in some

00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:56,900
cases quite significantly so this is

00:11:53,930 --> 00:12:00,440
we're happy to the it supposed to

00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:03,200
write so it's cross-platform again which

00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,120
is important for most go out it and it

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,070
uses the dedicated hardware on your

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,650
machine that looks and performance

00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:13,130
measures right so I machine awesome or

00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:15,470
recent processes are better have it it

00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:19,010
measures things like cache hits or

00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:22,300
misses jumps taken total instructions

00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:25,310
alright so very little little stuff and

00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:27,110
by simply writing an agent for it

00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:29,960
wherever the take those metrics and it's

00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,490
like the entire system right instead of

00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,960
writing this into your C program you can

00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:36,800
just take a look across the system from

00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:39,650
profile so how if it is the end of your

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:43,970
contract this chart instead of being

00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:45,590
updated specific is simply happy so we

00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,540
could just speak values we've written

00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:49,700
this agent how can extract the values

00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,950
and you can do something a simple right

00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:54,620
let me just like here it's going to spit

00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:58,790
up and take metadata to become a values

00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:01,900
but realistically gracious and route the

00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:04,450
percentages to stuff is more important

00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,370
running terminal with one number another

00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,380
bucket terminal with another outcome I'm

00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,390
program I'm lazy I don't want to try to

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,130
grab them number highlighted and true to

00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,840
my folk inator grab another woman looks

00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:18,520
closer that my calculator go all about

00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:21,230
2% passions that's this ridiculous so

00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:24,170
this is a perfect tool to your money

00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:27,380
so again we've got all the tools so now

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:31,370
we want to slit properly or use pmid to

00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:34,010
do if you money is for symmetric suffern

00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:36,980
session it allows you to form a metric

00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:39,680
space expressions for a violation so

00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,930
taking the totes it does it take total

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,150
charge right and you can compare that

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,770
this in a total bottle cap this isn't

00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:48,350
gonna model you can compare those two

00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:50,480
metric values and you compare them using

00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:52,430
ratios channelside risks right it's a

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,740
little scripting language in life and

00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,810
you can run a bed space on let me see

00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:00,470
right so you can raise alarms where

00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:04,310
shell commands log it and again you can

00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:05,600
win some live or archived data so let's

00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:08,750
say you've got a system set up when

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,300
something fatal you can proactively then

00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:13,310
or quadratic vision say look what

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,190
happened write a rule to describe it

00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:18,500
let's say you're gay base eat quick

00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,840
little bit back outside inner curve we

00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,390
can write a script an upset that it

00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:27,860
works and then it's all cheer up systems

00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:29,820
to America and right-clicking run rules

00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,610
across multiple hosts again

00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,980
this is all across the river so let's

00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:37,440
take a look at a simple expression if

00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,330
you look at some of Intel's forwards to

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,910
Allah guides like you mentioned before

00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:44,250
total instructions as a percentage with

00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:47,520
cache misses getting something of

00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:50,850
interest so let's start with that little

00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:53,580
three cash this as a percentage or /

00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:54,780
mobile instructional assistant now

00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,720
that's not useful you watch on that

00:14:54,780 --> 00:15:00,300
percentage so you're just x 500 right

00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,250
that's basic a ripple bit then you need

00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,470
to decide what percentage and like a

00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:08,250
certain bode well for an arbitrary value

00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:10,890
I'll say cube Sun right then we had

00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:14,460
summits which is eme skating saying some

00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:16,770
instant sort it so if this percentage is

00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,650
created with g % what you want to do

00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,100
while you walk something percentage of

00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:26,060
level

00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:31,520
how do you take action occurs that's a

00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:35,210
simple all right so we're gonna do 2pm

00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:38,630
of d.c already should be doing your duty

00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:39,920
to all right it's a fix on cutie but

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,050
maybe you don't want to use that for

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,850
whatever reason I like it but if you

00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:47,360
want to lose your total percentage of

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:52,130
your way let's be flexible and there are

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:55,670
two tools graphite or fam and the

00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:58,360
preacher both what's what using piece of

00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:02,060
these architecture design is easy right

00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:05,810
relatives so again how would it fit into

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:07,850
it with the PM tool p.m. city and then

00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,500
we write the tool level will display the

00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,360
information to graphite order fan out of

00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:15,110
proper length right it is simply

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,360
presenting metrics and I usually we're

00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:20,300
chipping to do a modified version of

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,660
their family around and by doing that

00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:27,350
you get something looks like this pretty

00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:30,830
lights I mean ready right away you can

00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:32,790
see overall trends so on let's see june

00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:35,790
thirteenth you guys by committing

00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:37,350
total voter colonel and prevent you can

00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:40,310
zoom in highlight what's interesting to

00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:42,240
you Admiral bars data and the bottom

00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:45,540
look you've got the access to measure

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,790
samples percentage and the time the

00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:50,250
bottom bar just by slowing across the

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:53,430
network so you can see what some again

00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:56,160
if you get full or something on the flip

00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:59,130
side of things you can use graphite so

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,320
graphite will present to you as our eyes

00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:03,900
let me measure before and you simply

00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,990
open those up navigate your way down the

00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:09,480
course of metrics tree and you highlight

00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:12,240
the metric interested in so this is the

00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:16,890
number of canal users log on and you see

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:19,740
overflow information so cool that I mean

00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:22,950
without rewriting huge you were able to

00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:26,040
present information to you logically and

00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:30,360
today it's peaceful putt offers a really

00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:32,190
wide regulation which is great what

00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,340
happens if you want to go deeper I even

00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:38,520
one more mission of the program was it

00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:41,030
is intrusive we assistant like to apply

00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,030
via help

00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:13,039
so systems often for examining the logic

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:15,090
it's we do so buddies ministers and

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,820
citizens have basically links of

00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:19,619
strength of debuggers trick starts and

00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:23,549
grow flowers so you have the ability to

00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:25,440
trace offense of a good program analysis

00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:28,080
and you have the ability to figure out

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:32,369
what's going on your program and what's

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:35,549
that she goes wrong so other side we use

00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:37,109
scripts and so typical scorpio house

00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:40,559
until will get an event you'll gather

00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:42,599
some information in your printed out so

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,789
what we do with that is we take it we

00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:47,090
convert it into the link Colonel call

00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:51,330
Joe and hope instead

00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:53,010
I'm not I scoot it and we'll get a whole

00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,970
bunch of a printout that will give us

00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:59,700
some information about what's going on

00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:03,730
so scripts basically have two major

00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:06,269
the first one and no points are the

00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:08,739
events that you want

00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:11,200
then you have the hands and the henry's

00:19:08,739 --> 00:19:13,899
bar what it's execute time you have you

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,720
been affirmed and so they're basically

00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:18,549
the way that you'll gather information

00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:24,129
look at stuff and being Prince the

00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:26,710
please so let me give an example a

00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:31,600
sample code we can just use a little all

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:35,409
over so starting off a little choose an

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,989
event to probe and you will just choose

00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:41,980
to get and began basically the start of

00:19:37,989 --> 00:19:44,970
semester so the cancer event and within

00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,970
the hammer will just

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:50,870
another example go that we can look at

00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:53,690
is just tapping when the new bash

00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:56,029
process is started so yeah I'm looking

00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:58,159
on a coke plant this time for will use

00:19:56,029 --> 00:20:01,100
across the stash and we use a function

00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:02,809
name within the handler will just print

00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,559
a simple message that sets the bash

00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:05,559
process is started

00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:10,179
looking at something a little bit more

00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:13,140
complicated we can try and list out the

00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:17,110
functions in the order that process cosa

00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:21,100
so in this case our profile will be the

00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:23,230
process bash and hold it let function be

00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:27,730
a wild cards that we distract any

00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:29,860
function it's called and will actually

00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:32,530
suspect that we wanted to be when the

00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:36,640
function is called by using calm and

00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:39,160
then within the handler will climb print

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,780
out what functional who do that by using

00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,820
TV front which is a helper function

00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,290
announce we're not later and I'll

00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:48,210
basically write out what the pro point

00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:51,720
function is so actually bringing this

00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,720
this is kind of

00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:58,990
so another you seen a couple examples

00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:01,060
where do I should get started like where

00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:04,450
are you started I figure out what you

00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:06,460
can prove so if you don't ask you you

00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:11,140
can go you can look up take row points

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:15,640
there are and you can use I by executing

00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:17,710
south on purpose so just the basic

00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,040
example you have gamma probes Colonel

00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:23,400
groves module probes probes and so on

00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,400
and so forth

00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,710
so within the hammer you can system top

00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,900
has very many features that you find

00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:34,810
them in language so you have the

00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:38,200
Global's local streams integers so on so

00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:40,420
forth which shows we also have

00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,220
additional handy features like

00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:46,380
associative arrays for each loops

00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:49,660
aggregates macros and original matching

00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:52,900
so now we have the pro point type so you

00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:55,590
have high she gets started writing so

00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:58,720
for this will you use the single and

00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:03,310
we'll see mobile basically possible

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:07,870
total types or pro boxer so to do so you

00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:12,610
just use staff dash l and you'll give an

00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:14,890
example pro point hope so we'll just

00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:17,660
take the profit stop and we'll look at

00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:21,140
any function with that

00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:24,940
so venomous will get this time output

00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,940
you can see that there are two different

00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:30,870
weapon system top goes on context

00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:35,400
variables

00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:38,670
curves can access the content sir so you

00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:41,470
can actually listen using slap dash

00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:44,320
capital L which is

00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:47,340
lower case and so in this case we'll

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:51,640
look at que pasa stop create and

00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:53,620
obviously the key process of you is

00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:57,090
there and i'll also show up whole bunch

00:22:53,620 --> 00:23:02,620
of different variables

00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:06,990
Chloe play and a whole bunch of helpers

00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,990
you can also see the context variables

00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:17,430
top sets are the library

00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:20,010
the main purposes by level of

00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:21,900
abstraction so the user doesn't have to

00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:26,970
know the exact details of the track to

00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:32,010
do so for example we can look at K cross

00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:34,650
country and what it actually is is the

00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:37,650
pro point kernel function called process

00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:40,200
stuff return and those kinds of mouth

00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,910
full kind of hard to remember whereas if

00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,949
you look at keep a substrate that

00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:48,409
something simple something

00:23:44,949 --> 00:23:51,709
so que pasa stop create action alias for

00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:54,440
Carla actionable well and feel actually

00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:59,179
see huh you got us all the illest probes

00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:01,339
by using snapped up profiles within

00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:06,799
tablets we also have helper functions

00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:10,989
and look at an example you can will use

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:13,879
que pasa Sophia's 4.84 point sir and

00:24:10,989 --> 00:24:17,179
within handler will try and print out

00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:20,779
what processes started so que pasa sup

00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:23,269
Erica she has a variable new PID but

00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:25,249
just printing out of the PID is never

00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:27,859
really helpful so what we'll use is a

00:24:25,249 --> 00:24:30,919
helper function guidance exact name and

00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:36,169
it will convert the new p IE into a

00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:38,409
process in place and so brain script we

00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:38,409
will

00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:46,299
for the sevierville of functions and top

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:50,830
sets you can just use that code

00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:56,710
functions along the helper functions we

00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:59,620
have help of rebels so example we'll

00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:04,549
look at what all the system

00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:07,520
and within handlers you can just print

00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:10,190
out what name was this call was and what

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,309
the parameters were so in this case mate

00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:17,090
and arms are both upper function helper

00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:19,309
various parts actually special or using

00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:22,070
the same size of special because we have

00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:25,039
in cases where signs on both sides both

00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:29,120
sides l basically print out the

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:32,230
parameters in the next for mature so

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,230
Brian my script

00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:36,680
output and as you can see the helper

00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:39,260
functions are doing useful because you

00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:41,180
don't actually need to know what in this

00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:43,010
case what the parameter names are and

00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:45,080
how many parameters are so in the first

00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:46,450
line you'll see there's only three

00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,750
parameters

00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,750
there

00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:55,140
so you've once I put a couple propyne

00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:58,570
types are what you pay stick and help

00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:00,880
handlers but how you really tell any

00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:03,850
together into something that's more

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,150
useful so as I mentioned it's kind of

00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:08,890
system tap abuses further but it's a

00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:12,850
little bit more money you can actually

00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:18,610
like help fix your bubbles that you

00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:20,790
found so looking at an example something

00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,790
like

00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:26,760
program and what it basically does is

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,620
sometimes it was super

00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,090
message

00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,840
ah

00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:52,150
so excuse program is to get less time

00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:56,680
and if you have the country that's the

00:26:52,150 --> 00:27:00,370
tough line over there and it happening

00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:04,540
stopped show

00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:07,090
so getting some kind of program of this

00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:10,900
you want to figure out what's wrong this

00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:13,570
is a simple example and it doesn't have

00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:16,630
much of body ratio source code source

00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:18,790
for the small it doesn't do much for

00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:21,840
this is kind of thought process can you

00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:24,809
apply to watch yourself programs

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,460
the source code is just large there's so

00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:29,480
much to read there's so much to look at

00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:32,340
and so much to just understand with it

00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:36,059
so system talk can really help with that

00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:38,429
and so going through this process we can

00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:40,559
think that where do you serve coke where

00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:44,520
you sir figure out with problems might

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:46,620
occur and if we take the row of looking

00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,570
at functions specifically we can think

00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:51,510
about will dysfunction X never called

00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:54,149
function block and it does look what

00:27:51,510 --> 00:28:00,990
parameters like what's when are using

00:27:54,149 --> 00:28:02,159
has been are you turtle then at the atom

00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:04,230
once you figured out what the problem

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:08,820
might be you can think about working

00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:12,480
what can you do this so sorry with we're

00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:14,340
home yeah listing modes really useful in

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,020
this case we just lists what functions

00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,020
are we know options are

00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:24,650
so thinking about what functions call

00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:28,820
what we can work as may never

00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:34,580
superb again between good ones we knew

00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:37,130
that made of sleep so to do so just to

00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,630
show how to figure out what functions

00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,520
might actually also you can use this

00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:43,340
kind of example we're getting you're

00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:45,680
using this single and you're specifying

00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,930
the processes Terminator a function of

00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:50,540
the main and you're also using a

00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:53,120
colleague khinkali is basically the

00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:54,940
function that's being called by me and

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:59,470
in this case believe it as a while

00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:59,470
functions a bunch of the Vico

00:29:00,879 --> 00:29:08,749
and if you notice we also have a context

00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:10,460
variable but the community so that was

00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:15,219
really just a starting point figure out

00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:15,219
where the problem like what to look at

00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:25,759
so moving on from that like how do you

00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:28,099
determine where when it ends and from

00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:32,899
that what about their turns out you from

00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:36,799
Ziggler so we can write a script that

00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:39,019
will basically shows what the return

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,010
value from sleepers entity which really

00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:44,370
deserted

00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:46,140
so soon with a variable old num we'll

00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:49,590
just said to negative one for the time

00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:51,570
being and with an honor perfect we'll

00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:54,570
use pools the study that to be

00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:56,990
Terminator process terminated functions

00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,990
number

00:29:57,169 --> 00:30:02,370
so if not we'll just check if the

00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:04,470
current num that's being returned from

00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:05,789
sleeper is going to be less than or

00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:09,299
equal to the old them that we have

00:30:05,789 --> 00:30:11,610
before if so we're just going to further

00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:16,629
narrow same introducing with every

00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:21,110
problem otherwise we'll just move on

00:30:16,629 --> 00:30:24,500
so actually run the script just use

00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:26,509
system tab will use the dash Speedway to

00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:31,190
specify that we want the program turn

00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:33,559
Terminator only sorry we use the dash t

00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:35,690
play to specify that we want the script

00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:38,809
only run for his bone mr. modern

00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:42,980
sciences and I also actually start also

00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:46,279
terminated so running the script we get

00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:51,500
and you can see it was an error on fire

00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:54,259
so we found in problem so another thing

00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:59,919
at what's actually wrong with it how can

00:30:54,259 --> 00:31:03,559
we fix again will be a source code

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:07,399
typical summation would just be num + +

00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:11,509
someone's you can fix but what happened

00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:12,500
this is like this examples really simple

00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:13,850
but what happens if you're actually

00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:20,509
looking at something much larger

00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:26,590
something that's not so what do you

00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:32,630
really do it that one well alternative

00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:36,620
increase for us this is bull gasps there

00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:41,890
with the global keep track of what the

00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:45,230
actual number is from that whoa the

00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:50,140
probe and will be processed traumatic

00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:50,140
function sleeper and generic terms Oh

00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:58,130
we'll look at if we want if mum is

00:31:56,299 --> 00:32:01,250
actually less than equal to what the

00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:04,429
actual de mexico city and so when crease

00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:07,419
I program and set that to return value

00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:10,720
or voice to the return value of sleeper

00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:16,480
this way in

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:20,669
phil has the actual done if not numb is

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,669
actually increasing like it should be

00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:37,389
so the result from remote it basically

00:32:35,139 --> 00:32:39,970
tells to sum up that you know your

00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:42,759
changes context variable so in this case

00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:45,039
it's basically saying that you know that

00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:47,909
you can gain confidence variable and

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:55,500
that you are sure that it's okay and

00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:55,500
everything is fine institution so great

00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:05,970
exactly so hopefully there are two

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,440
takeaways from this one when there's the

00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:10,620
impending Terminator apocalypse you

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,340
system tap and two that's the type of

00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:17,250
information we want to get involved PCP

00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:19,110
it fits the bill so how we make use of

00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:21,750
this information you know it's got

00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:24,600
valuable output and you were able to

00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:26,010
vary specify various pro points right

00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,360
depending on what you want to see

00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:29,460
depending on let's say network latency

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,280
we can specify that insistent app this

00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,660
is great some things like perfume aight

00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:37,050
not be able to get that information or

00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:39,150
change the output and exposes a little

00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:40,470
information safely right that's a big

00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:42,540
thing we don't want to you know have

00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:45,660
users risk whose information or

00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:47,910
something like that so how this would

00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:51,120
fit in right again instead of fabulous

00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:52,740
time we're going to say assistant app so

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,120
as the example you know this is what

00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:57,120
we've been currently working on this is

00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,680
still death so one partial ask

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,030
yourselves was how can we determine the

00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,890
network latency on the network device

00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:04,230
that information isn't typically

00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:07,680
available through annual various means

00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:09,929
so what we did is we have this PM day

00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,340
that we've specially written and we're

00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:13,980
gonna have the output kernel module from

00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:15,810
system tap and the trick here is to get

00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:18,090
the system kernel module to spit into

00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:19,560
the PM da or the agent correctly right

00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:22,020
that's how it's all going to fit

00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,240
together and by writing a special

00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,830
assistant app script and formatting it

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,679
properly right we're hoping to get this

00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:30,870
more programmable in the future we had

00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:33,990
an engineer write a script that you

00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:35,700
specify the network devices he was

00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:38,070
interested in dev one and dev to or

00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:40,139
total eyes and ethernet actually exists

00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:44,310
he runs the script and then in a

00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:47,070
different terminal here an EMF 0 FD stop

00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:48,870
JSON and this is all still moving parts

00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:51,240
but the JSON is actually really nifty

00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:53,580
because there are other tools that use

00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,050
JSON to communicate like stats d this

00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,850
could potentially be used for something

00:34:55,050 --> 00:35:00,360
like that too so it's still very well

00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:02,520
input and if you look at the output dev

00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:05,640
one dove two nothing but the value of

00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,840
the transmit latency is 319 we're still

00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,930
working on things like the units i know

00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:11,859
that's very important

00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:14,680
and the transmitted count is valued at

00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:16,270
you know what two million change right

00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:19,510
so these are the type of low-level

00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:20,890
information that sorry sounds good type

00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:23,349
of low-level information that we're

00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:25,119
interested so hopefully this is giving

00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:26,829
you a couple examples and how you can

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,589
get you the information you want out of

00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:33,540
various applications and display to you

00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:37,089
correctly thanks very much any questions

00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:38,890
no hopefully you can contribute this is

00:35:37,089 --> 00:35:46,990
where you'll find us feel free to pass

00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:48,819
dress oh sorry good oh yeah yeah

00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:50,980
absolutely we actually had a contributor

00:35:48,819 --> 00:35:54,700
on line you fed information from various

00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:57,400
home automation home automation systems

00:35:54,700 --> 00:36:01,470
I fed into PCP so then he turned around

00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:06,420
his browser and saw the information so

00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:11,170
anything else yeah where these tools

00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:13,119
stand with respect to support for non

00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:20,769
x36 architectures

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:22,359
specifically arm 3264 well its variety

00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:25,329
of architectures arm 60-foot particular

00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:27,849
maybe should be fine yeah all we should

00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:31,390
get your name sorry my name's dave

00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:36,549
rowley i'm also our bed at I'm also PCB

00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:38,349
developer those particular hardware

00:36:36,549 --> 00:36:41,049
architectures I have to go back to you

00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:43,630
out and a lot of a full list of

00:36:41,049 --> 00:36:45,759
platforms you can also do that this

00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:50,950
quite an extensive some of them are very

00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:52,839
well take pride are different work it

00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:54,880
struck me that when especially you're

00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:57,789
talking that hash this isn't supported

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,769
it the collection mechanism for some of

00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:02,529
like instruction camels and so on must

00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:05,249
be must be very architecture specific to

00:37:02,529 --> 00:37:09,759
to get that information so many areas

00:37:05,249 --> 00:37:12,490
for example 11 agent is called linux and

00:37:09,759 --> 00:37:15,039
someone who collects external metrics

00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:18,750
and for every black one the report will

00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:21,120
be equivalent of that particular agent

00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:27,080
try to write them as orderly as possible

00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:30,210
but you know something's just systems if

00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:32,700
you want to either contact us or leave

00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:36,210
us your contact information would be

00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:39,080
advocating that fulness I just don't

00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,080
want to say yes

00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:56,290
yeah agent yeah it varies depending on

00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:58,690
what you're trying to do we have

00:37:56,290 --> 00:38:00,940
beginner programming guides and

00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:03,640
introduction tools do you write in

00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:10,290
Python parole or see ya you can do them

00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:12,610
all so whatever you're comfortable yeah

00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:16,210
those different languages and there's

00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:19,030
actually a skeleton agent that you can

00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:23,050
use a starting point the rampages have

00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:29,470
to follow certain protocols rules and if

00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:32,200
you start this the skeleton there's also

00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:37,960
a agent a sample agent which you can

00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:40,930
take a look at it there's nothing else

00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:45,580
thanks very much oh sure what's the

00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:47,350
documentation extensive yeah so one

00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:49,360
manual in particular I encourage you to

00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:51,730
look at was the PCP enter guide it's

00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,300
online as well in PDF form and it comes

00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:56,650
both there's a systems programmer

00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:59,370
version and a user administrator guide

00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:02,580
so it depends what paper comes out

00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:02,580
there's also

00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:10,420
you know the metric between space

00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:12,850
represents an API and how you access it

00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:16,750
presents an API as you want to write a

00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:20,670
tool and the other side is the protocol

00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:23,230
for the ages of ultra representative API

00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:25,780
so that's actually pulled is fully

00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:30,430
described and Amanda gauges get the saw

00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:33,610
us all but also on the website we call

00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:36,100
them the books there's programmers guide

00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:38,530
that describes all that and there's also

00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:41,080
a Sisyphean guide which is tailored more

00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:46,470
to a system and using existing

00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:46,470
components to set up whatever you want

00:39:49,260 --> 00:40:00,900
oh well thanks very much everybody and

00:39:51,270 --> 00:40:05,390
John Reznikoff just like to you just saw

00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:05,390
smoke covered things thanks very much

00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:17,440
cuz I talk really quickly if I'm our way

00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,440
