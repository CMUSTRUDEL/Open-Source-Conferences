present and open up funny in lagos it

00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:27,180
and he received a bachelor's mathematic

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,100
from the University Waterloo 2005 with

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,440
honors in computer science and spent

00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,710
most of his professional career during

00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:37,680
parallel garbage collector IBM is that

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,170
currently buildings open up autonomy ink

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,809
as a technology startup to solve

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,970
problems with online all gardens in here

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:49,290
here to go to talk about be on

00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:52,110
open-source frigerator systems all right

00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,340
so yeah thanks for the introduction so

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,160
I'll try and get through this fairly

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,450
quickly but one of the ideas as well as

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,649
if you have any questions isn't going

00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,219
through like I do want to have sort of

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,690
time at the end up actual Q&A but also

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,979
if there's something specific that you

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,180
think is misleading you want me to

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,830
address right away just put your hand up

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,810
and I can't get to it before the end of

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,149
the slide cuz i wanna make sure i don't

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,000
get off on some some tangent that

00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:16,050
someone's missing something so yeah well

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,240
one of the things also want to mention

00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,340
is if you're interested in issues such

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,060
as federated systems Blaze's doing a

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,430
talk in this room in an hour which is

00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,420
closely related to this area but we made

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,460
sure that we're not going to be

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,260
redundant or anything so it'll actually

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,170
they'll build on top of each other not

00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,490
actually be conflicting so what i'm

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,070
going to talk about is how the ideas

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:41,070
behind can the open source movement how

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,570
we've gone we've kind of grown beyond

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,939
what some of the protections those gave

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,470
us work and what we could do to kind of

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,240
extend those into kind of a new era

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,210
where everything's kind of network

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,750
connected and and remote services so

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,460
it's all about federated systems so just

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,780
get sort of a background about how i'm

00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,250
going to be going through this what i'm

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,689
going to be talking about so i'm going

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,610
to just do a quick rundown of kind of

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,610
what i mean by walled gardens this is a

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,630
concept that we're probably all

00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,799
relatively familiar with but just to

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,829
make sure that i kind of communicate

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,600
what I mean talk about why open source

00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:14,700
on its own isn't enough to solve those

00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,209
specific problems why we need something

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:21,030
that's a bit more what does open source

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:22,859
itself actually mean in terms of what

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,910
did we actually benefit from the open

00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:25,470
source movement what were some of the

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,000
core principles that actually were

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,130
beneficial to us there

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,900
and how do we sort of move those forward

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:35,580
as the problem changes underneath us

00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,110
which brings me to actually trying to

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,970
apply this to federated systems okay

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,700
well what is it what does Federation

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,740
mean what is a federated system where

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,470
are some examples of how we're doing

00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,180
this already how we actually have

00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,670
federated technology within the internet

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,590
and there's some of those things which

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,270
are already solved problems and then we

00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:58,560
look at distributed social networking

00:02:54,270 --> 00:03:00,390
this is a sort of it's sort of the the

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,220
classic problem we're trying to solve

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,720
the one that a lot of people are dealing

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,980
with directly saying that what's going

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,560
on with social networking is really

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,570
causing some problems and how can we

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,220
solve that so distributed social

00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,950
networking is really sort of the the

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,550
perfect next target for using federated

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,720
systems and federated technology and I'm

00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,300
just going to kind of wrap it up with

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,610
talking a bit about some of the open

00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,170
source opportunities through up metonymy

00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,890
things like what we actually give out

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:31,140
and how to find that information income

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:34,380
of the components involved there so

00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:36,209
first of all with walled gardens this

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,590
comes down to the idea that you've sort

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:39,269
of an inside and outside on the inside

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,400
you have the central absolute authority

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,530
so they're going to define the

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,290
information that's available itself what

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,239
you actually can say but also the

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,430
software meaning how you can say it so

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,260
not only are you now subject to some

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,850
external this sort of authority that

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,590
actually controls the system in terms of

00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,650
talking about what you can and can't say

00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,480
which which may be a concern for you but

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,070
also if you want to do something like

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,760
build a piece of software that actually

00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:07,230
kind of uses this the existing

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,650
communication networks are the existing

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:12,269
data in some way that you want you may

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,769
not be able to there's going to be

00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:16,019
strong limitations in terms of what you

00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,880
can really do because the software isn't

00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,530
something you're running it's something

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,660
they're running now within this walled

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,790
garden and those of us of course on the

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,710
outside have either no access or limited

00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,780
access to the system so this is the kind

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,300
of problem you get where someone sends

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,130
you a link to something online and you

00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,410
click on it and you get a login panel

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,419
instead of getting information and this

00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,220
is of course a huge problem is really

00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,720
counter to the purpose of the internet

00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,180
and where

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,740
going now this also brings up some other

00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,710
questions and this has been a huge issue

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,990
recently with concerns like NSA spying

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:50,930
and the idea that your data is being

00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:53,780
harvested for marketing reasons well

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,760
who's listening in on this and why who

00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,550
actually has access to the information

00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,750
or even the associations between people

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,970
and ideas that you're actually putting

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,070
in these systems what are they doing

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,480
with that information and part of the

00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,130
problem you have with these environments

00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,000
is we don't really know who's doing that

00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:12,290
and there's really no way to find out it

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,230
also creates a single point of failure

00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,820
so yeah sure they're actually going to

00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,380
be load balanced and geographically

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,530
distributed within any one of these

00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:23,510
services but there's still this idea

00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,700
that if someone wanted to control your

00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:28,190
access to one of these services it would

00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,830
not be very hard they're essentially you

00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:32,120
want to stop people from organizing if

00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,590
they're trying to protest against some

00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,900
of your government is doing well we'll

00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,190
just mess up the DNS record for facebook

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,440
and suddenly they lose the ability to

00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,450
talk to each other which doesn't really

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,640
make any sense because they were kind of

00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:47,000
all nearby and there's lots of problems

00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,830
related to that which come up so open

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,120
source on its own isn't enough because

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,660
the real question is what does the

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,100
source actually give you and this is

00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,470
where we run into the limitation for

00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,380
example look at facebook if you had

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,180
facebook source code you could not run

00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,190
facebook not because you don't have the

00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,229
hardware maybe you could but because

00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,910
it's not about the code it's actually

00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:10,300
about the networks within it so all of

00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:12,320
these users on their existing system

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,390
they're not going to migrate to yours

00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,460
and there is no compatibility between

00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:20,690
the two they are built to be distinct

00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:22,070
entities that control the world so it's

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,410
not the code that's going to help you

00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,390
it's where the users are now a slightly

00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:29,030
different example which is not quite as

00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,590
concrete not as severe but kind of

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,630
points out one of the other issues

00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,210
related to this which is if you had say

00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:38,570
the code for Google Docs well you could

00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:40,820
kind of run in but all your data already

00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:43,430
exists somewhere else so you have to

00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,990
move that for you you have to move it

00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,360
over to where you're putting this now

00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,950
who really owns the data if it's

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,720
physically with in someone else's data

00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,129
center and they physically control the

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,729
software used to manipulate it

00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:57,349
on which level is it yours I guess you

00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:59,330
have a password somewhere and that kind

00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:01,550
of represents ownership but is it really

00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:03,229
the same and do you migrate all your

00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:06,139
data through just a million copy paste

00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:08,989
operations so what do we need beyond the

00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:11,330
source itself what's sort of the next

00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:13,099
step to take this forward and to that I

00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,800
think we need to look at some of the

00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,389
core ideas behind what open source

00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,179
really meant to us where the benefits

00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:21,589
were and why it was why it ended up

00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:22,639
being so useful for us in the first

00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:24,469
place because it wasn't just about

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,939
moving source code around notes it's

00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:29,209
about the principles behind how we

00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:30,679
actually needed that and this now this

00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:32,749
is going to be as many different

00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:35,119
interpretations and definitions of this

00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:36,769
as there are users but I've kind of

00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:39,649
whittled it down to sort of three core

00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:41,509
ones that I see come up a lot as sort of

00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:43,309
why people want to buy why people like

00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:45,439
open source the first one is it's

00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:47,059
educational well this is just great

00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,949
quick start learning opportunity you

00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:51,469
want to know how to do something why not

00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:53,269
look at how someone did it but then you

00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:54,529
you can learn it that way and a lot of

00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:56,240
people especially when they're just

00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:58,399
starting out in something this is a

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,929
great way for them to just see okay how

00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,610
do I conceptualize a problem of a

00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:04,069
certain size how do I understand how to

00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,699
perform this kind of operation so while

00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:09,289
you look at the source right our TFS

00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:11,569
another one is the free as in beer idea

00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:14,990
a lot of open source software is free

00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:18,639
you don't pay Apache a bunch of money to

00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:21,319
download compile and run a web server

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,629
you often will pay for something like

00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:27,369
maybe you want a documentation or

00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:30,139
services associated with it support and

00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:31,729
maybe you if you wanted them to fix

00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:32,990
something for you or God you've had a

00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:35,419
feature for you while you're going to be

00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:38,050
paying someone to do that but just to

00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:41,029
get it as it is right now is the sort of

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,529
single packaged idea that usually

00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:44,389
doesn't cost anything so to a lot of

00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:47,389
people it was just that availability of

00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:50,060
free software in a monetary free sense

00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:52,040
and the other big kind of pillar is the

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,589
free as in speech and this is where it

00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,779
comes down more to kind of a right that

00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:59,480
you believe you possess the idea that

00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:01,970
you have some sense of freedom within

00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,069
the world and this really comes down to

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,630
making sure nobody can control you

00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:07,400
you're no longer subject

00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,980
to the business whims of some company

00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,570
providing a product if they decide now

00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,640
they want to be purchased by another

00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:15,770
company that maybe has that you have

00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,070
some incompatibility with you're no

00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:20,450
longer sort of up the creek there's

00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,980
always some weight you can get out of

00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,870
this you can either use the source

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,780
yourself to liberate your data or your

00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,880
processes or you could at least pay

00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:30,500
someone else to do it there's there's at

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,000
least a way to get there from here no

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,630
matter what was going on you weren't

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,150
completely tied down so how do we apply

00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:40,730
these ideas to what we're doing now on

00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:42,500
on the internet well a bunch of these

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,480
things are quite clear things like the

00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,980
educational case well as long as you

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,420
didn't know how need to know how that

00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,040
particular product works you could

00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,880
probably find the source to something

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,410
that would help you out there's the free

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,390
as in beer well most things are propped

00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,920
up advertising anyway so for the most

00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,620
part you're not really paying out of

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,790
pocket for a lot of what you're using

00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,820
you're paying in one sense but at least

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:06,500
not money but the free is in speech the

00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,300
idea that nobody control you can control

00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,520
you this is something that we've sort of

00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:13,160
we don't really have an answer for this

00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:15,200
one so this is where I say that

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,790
federated systems are kind of the way

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,020
forward the thing we need to look at as

00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:23,600
we kind of expand upon this so what is

00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,850
Federation then well at a score at its

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,620
core idea is just a collection of

00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:30,020
semi-autonomous components so

00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,100
individually each of them represent

00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,810
something autonomous they don't

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,580
necessarily need to be connected to the

00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:36,650
entire Federation an order from the

00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:39,380
function they can basically function

00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:41,810
just as they are or as a partial network

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,850
that still has partial capability it

00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:46,400
isn't in all or nothing and it's not

00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,470
monolithic so which this means that they

00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,240
need some notion of interoperability now

00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,590
in a technical space this is going to

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,630
mean something like oh there's some sort

00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:55,160
of protocol like when you're sending

00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,140
email there's a protocol for how to do

00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,760
that things like this it comes down to

00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,500
that that kind of the technical language

00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,780
that actually fills in the barrier

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:06,020
between these these autonomous

00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:07,580
components and this of course is to

00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:12,170
facilitate at a basic level information

00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:14,300
sharing the all of these components

00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:16,400
either represent data or they represent

00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,740
capabilities so your interoperability is

00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,930
how you expose that across them

00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,010
and data and information sharing

00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,690
especially becomes important when you do

00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:25,970
start looking at things like federated

00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:28,010
social networking because there's issues

00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:30,320
of where does information actually lived

00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:32,080
and that factors into some your

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,339
decision-making in the design choices

00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,470
now this leads to sort of a

00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:40,100
decentralized organization concept there

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,959
is no centre of it the internet on a

00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,420
whole kind of already is organized this

00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:46,820
way there is no center of the internet

00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,709
it the fact that we've elected to make a

00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:52,790
few centers of the internet is more of a

00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:55,700
bug than a feature but at its core we

00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:58,880
shouldn't be limited by those things so

00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,470
order some just so that make it clear

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,420
this is not something brand new and

00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,339
crazy this is sort of like no we already

00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:07,459
we've already done this before several

00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:09,440
times and in fact sometimes when we've

00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:11,930
done this if we've managed to continue

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,279
caring about those factors the Federated

00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:16,790
systems have lasted longer than any

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,410
close analogue because everyone can

00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:21,529
become involved you're not limited by

00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:24,649
one company so obvious one of course is

00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:27,110
email well you're all a user at a server

00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:29,690
there's no email corporation there's no

00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,490
mr. or mrs. email who receives you know

00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:33,589
who you buy stamps from or something

00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:36,140
like that it's something that everyone

00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:38,630
could kind of play along everyone had a

00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:41,570
vested interest in becoming part of this

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:42,829
game and they could think and compete

00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,630
there with value add and all those

00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:47,300
things so this is basically just a data

00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,740
exchange system now and it's passive now

00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,839
one of the reasons i want to point that

00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,450
out is that it's something that's fairly

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,399
low cost in terms of computation if

00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:58,459
you're not receiving email you're not on

00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:00,140
the cpu so it doesn't matter this makes

00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:01,730
it easy to deploy this now another

00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:06,140
example which is more recent than that

00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:07,310
of course is XMPP or jobber which is for

00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,320
the most part people use it as a

00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,570
messaging system but I can do a lot more

00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,640
now instant messaging at its core is

00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:15,829
presence the idea that you need to be

00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,300
able to tell people you are there and

00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:20,450
have them be able to track that

00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:23,329
information now this is an active idea

00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:28,459
because presence is an active activity

00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:30,290
you can't be only running when someone's

00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:30,690
looking at you because in a presence

00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,970
network

00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:35,340
sort of always looking at you and this

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,840
of course is the basis for primarily

00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:40,320
instant messaging but they do other

00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,820
things with it as well now open ID is

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,910
sort of another one of these I think is

00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:47,210
worth mentioning because it's actually

00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:50,220
the problem it solves which is federated

00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:52,170
identification is actually sort of part

00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,550
of the overall distributed social

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:57,660
networking issue that you'd need to

00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:59,280
solve it is one component of that that

00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,790
you can have kind of this single sign-on

00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,230
for the internet and that's really kind

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,940
of part of what we're going to have to

00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:08,370
do any way to solve some of these other

00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,330
problems so it's another example of that

00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:14,370
and of course it's passive too because

00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:16,170
unless your your identity broker is

00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:20,220
directly answering an identification

00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:22,170
request it's not doing anything so the

00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,000
next big one of course is the one we

00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:26,280
have today the distributed social

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,310
networking and this is a huge problem if

00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:31,290
you look at something like the list of

00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:33,540
distributed social networks on Wikipedia

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:36,300
it's like enough is like a hundred of

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:39,000
them or so lots and lots of people are

00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,290
trying to solve this problem and so I'm

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,570
going to talk about sort of some of the

00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,250
issues related to this and because throw

00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,170
up an autonomy this is also one of the

00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:48,120
problems that that cyst themselves going

00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,980
to talk about just some design decisions

00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,750
that have been made with some of these

00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,190
different organizations and how they

00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,360
tried to solve the problem and some of

00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:57,450
the differences that come about because

00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,460
of that so this is all about fixing that

00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,900
walled garden problem now this is only

00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,090
one way of looking at the walled garden

00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,700
problem but it's a really really good

00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:07,050
one because we have lots of examples so

00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,310
you have to answer questions we're doing

00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,040
this like where does the data itself

00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:13,170
actually live and what can data do are

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,880
we just talking about data reading and

00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,200
writing your key value pairs or

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,820
something like that or are we actually

00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:21,180
talking about capabilities that are

00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:23,220
exposed by different components and this

00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,570
changes how you look at how to solve it

00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,940
depending on how you want to answer

00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:28,440
these questions so I'm going to talk

00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,500
about three sort of different approaches

00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,300
now the one which is seems to be by far

00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,490
the most common is what I refer to as

00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:38,160
the server oriented approach the idea

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,630
where it's sort of building distributed

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,270
social networks the way you build email

00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:43,670
servers where there's a user at a server

00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,460
all their information

00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:48,800
is effectively contained within that now

00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,150
there's interaction between servers but

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,120
it's all really about the user

00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:55,250
containing data within one place and

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,600
this is this seems to be by far the most

00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,340
common way of trying to solve this

00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,140
problem by looking around to some of the

00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,960
up some of the solutions that do exist

00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:05,510
today now the other one I wanted to talk

00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,130
about in detail as well is application

00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:10,160
oriented now this is help natano me

00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:12,980
works it's where instead of things being

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,350
based around users in servers now you're

00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:18,080
instead just talking about applications

00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:20,720
basically just web web services

00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,390
effectively that exist as this kind of

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,930
complex mesh across the entire Internet

00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,710
where one user can actually be their

00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:29,630
capabilities can be scattered across

00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:32,870
multiple machines and multiple domains

00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:35,000
and some of the changes this has in

00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:37,160
terms of hype to look at it and one of

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,320
the other approaches which I don't know

00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,240
of any actual solution using this but

00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,610
every time you try and talk about these

00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,140
ideas this is one of the questions it

00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,150
gets asked is why not use a blockchain

00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,620
approach why not why not solve

00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,990
distributed social networking the same

00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:53,780
way you solve Bitcoin or namecoin or

00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,190
something like that and I'm not going to

00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,410
talk about that's a great detail because

00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:59,630
there's no examples of people doing this

00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:01,880
that I'm very familiar with elyse but it

00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:03,950
does raise some questions such as does

00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,800
every node maintaining the blockchain

00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:08,930
have to have a copy of everyone's data

00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,460
that they've ever put on this and what

00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,760
kind of limitations exist in terms of

00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:15,530
what they can actually do and how do

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,780
they pay for that storage and that

00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:20,450
computational overhead of maintaining

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:22,250
information in this this block chain

00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:24,020
which is replicated everywhere and are

00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,580
there is are a finite size to it things

00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:28,250
like that questions which are

00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:30,530
complicated so looking at this kind of

00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:32,450
from the diagram perspective server

00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:35,750
oriented is all based on the idea that

00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:37,340
you have servers everything sort of

00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,650
starts with that the server itself is

00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,450
actually what gives you the Federation

00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:44,630
machinery the protocol for connecting

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:48,680
the dots within that you're going to

00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:52,820
have some collection of users and some

00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:54,230
some kind of data and now often in these

00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,670
systems and this is going to be

00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,900
potentially a bit of a simplification

00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,820
but

00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,620
it's often based on the idea that data

00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,160
exists within the server and there's

00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,780
this concept of data having a type and

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:09,020
the capabilities of the server define

00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,910
what data types it can understand so in

00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,560
this case for example the purple data is

00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,120
not the same as the green data they're

00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,800
different types they're effectively

00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:21,140
different kinds of applications using

00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:23,150
this so a user has data ownership and

00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,560
they have some sort of data access rules

00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,600
that they can describe things like

00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,940
permissions but all the data that they

00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:32,210
own is on the same server where they

00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:34,280
live now of course you can have

00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,900
connections between users and

00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:39,230
potentially those connections can go

00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:41,690
across the actual server boundaries

00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:43,730
themselves now in this case with

00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:47,690
something where server a does not

00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:50,510
understand the the purple data so the

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:52,310
line connecting it is dotted so in that

00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,050
case you'd have something where okay

00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,340
yeah can access that data but perhaps

00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,110
it's either going to ignore it because

00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,750
it can't understand it or just not ask

00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,280
for it so this is sort of a common model

00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,950
and it's it's very it has a certain

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,660
elegance to it because it means things

00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:07,280
like extensibility are fairly easy to

00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,620
implement you don't worry about what

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,480
it's going to mean on the actual

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,310
federated data communication layer

00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,080
that's just something the server handles

00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:17,090
for you you just define a new data type

00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,220
and you can now perform different kinds

00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:21,970
of operations if another server doesn't

00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:24,260
have your extension it'll just ignore it

00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,550
so this makes it fairly easy to do this

00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,160
but of course there's also a lot of

00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:29,960
limitations which is part of why the

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,520
open autonomy with open autonomy I went

00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,250
a different direction with this which

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,230
was instead of it being about data it's

00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,330
more about like none of you like all of

00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,190
these things on this slide since they're

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,290
just data items there's no ability to

00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:44,030
ask some operation to occur you're

00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:47,090
instead just reading and writing data

00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:48,830
tuples and again this there could be

00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:51,950
certain implementations which do a

00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:53,270
little differently than this but also

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,430
you have one of the other issues which

00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:57,320
is that all of your data for one user is

00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:59,270
now in one place you can't do something

00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,730
like say okay I want all my social

00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:03,320
networking handled in this system okay

00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:05,180
now I want to maybe add some sort of

00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,710
off-site you know cloud storage backup

00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,620
or something like that just when we use

00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,760
cases I want to deal with

00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,920
well that has to now be in the same

00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,410
system has to be on the same server

00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:18,050
there's kind of for every user all their

00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:19,670
information goes in one place so it is

00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,290
simple but does have a few limitations

00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,420
but because they were only looking at

00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:24,800
solving this is the most part when

00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,480
solving that distributed social

00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,790
networking problem it usually isn't

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,960
really a problem that's that's a

00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,970
limitation they're willing to absorb

00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,560
because it keeps things simple and

00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:36,650
they're still able to solve their

00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:38,210
problem now looking at it from an

00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,820
application oriented perspective this is

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,560
sort of a another example there another

00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,330
example of how you can use federated

00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,070
systems to solve one of these situations

00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:49,070
now this is based more on the idea that

00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:51,770
it's not about data it's about

00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:54,950
applications and capabilities so in this

00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:57,080
sense you've got a collection of instead

00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,690
of data items it's actually effectively

00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,340
web services and there's some ability

00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:03,050
for them to communicate with each other

00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,580
in a way where they are had they have

00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:07,010
trusted communication they know who's

00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:08,480
talking to them things like that so I'm

00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,310
going to actually draw the server's last

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,130
on this slide because the in this case

00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:15,350
they actually don't factor into it but

00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:18,200
it really comes down to we have a bunch

00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:20,540
of users now in this case because there

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,800
are no servers or at least the servers

00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,900
are not part of the design of how the

00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,280
system would have to work when you're

00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,530
looking at how the federated

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,150
communication has managed how you decide

00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:31,250
who you're talking to and what they're

00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:34,070
allowed to do it all has to actually go

00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,810
through some abstraction of a user so in

00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:38,060
this case we'll say that okay users are

00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:39,410
also just the entry point that you use

00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:42,500
will say it's just another kind of

00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:44,210
application and these can be connected

00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:47,030
because remembers users want to be able

00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:49,520
to describe their whatever their actual

00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:51,530
in the real world or at least in some

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,150
sense networks are between other users

00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,250
they want to be able to grant access to

00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:59,240
each other and know what's going on

00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:01,160
relative to each other then each of them

00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:05,000
can actually owned some collection of

00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:06,560
applications now all applications in

00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,590
this system just to keep it simple are

00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:12,170
owned by a user and in this case it's

00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:14,810
it's kind of a similar diagram to what I

00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:16,520
had last time except instead of it being

00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:18,620
about data and types it's about

00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,720
applications and capabilities all these

00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,600
applications have some sort of protocol

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,160
that exposes

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,150
what they can do and how you ask them to

00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:30,120
perform it and in this case all of the

00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:31,740
actual like the extra complexity that

00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,110
you see in this kind of situation is

00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:36,900
that now all of those protocols need to

00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:39,510
have some notion of what the actual kind

00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,549
of Federation protocol itself is because

00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:44,190
they can't rely on the idea that oh the

00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:46,980
server does it for me now of course it's

00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:48,600
not some monumental amount of effort it

00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,789
is basically just some software library

00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,530
link in it would do this for you but it

00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:54,090
is something that changes kind of where

00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,980
you draw some of the lines when you come

00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:59,340
down to design it and actually going to

00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,809
deploy things so just as an example of

00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,179
how you could draw this let's say the

00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:05,159
servers are like this now some of the

00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:08,280
users actually have capabilities that

00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:10,409
are not where they live so this is this

00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,830
solve some issues like yeah maybe I want

00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:14,909
to have maybe I want to have say

00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:16,710
off-site cloud storage on 10 different

00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:18,780
systems and then kind of treat it almost

00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:21,480
like a bit of a you know use the

00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,620
internet like my own personal raid well

00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,000
okay you could do that when you have a

00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:27,299
system like this that's based around

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,360
kind of breaking those boundaries and of

00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:32,309
course just a one thing to consider

00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:35,059
about this too is the way I've drawn

00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:38,039
this weather sort of the the three

00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:39,659
different servers here and how

00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:42,179
everything is partitioned around those

00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:43,890
is fairly arbitrary it just allowed to

00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:45,299
show some of these connections and

00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:47,460
interesting ways you could actually

00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:50,400
build this in a totally different way

00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:53,070
where say all the components here are on

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,230
one server or all of the components here

00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:57,450
are on their own server all

00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:01,169
independently it doesn't matter from the

00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:03,419
perspective of what's actually of how it

00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:07,850
actually would work it becomes just a

00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:11,010
performance concerned by that point so

00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:13,260
kind of getting past that then and if it

00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:15,030
is something that you sort of interested

00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,289
in or at least want to know kind of how

00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:19,530
some of the parts of it are put together

00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:22,890
and and what you can you can look at all

00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:25,140
this is available all the sources

00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:27,600
released under MIT license essentially

00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:30,669
because it was concise and it doesn't

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,859
limit what people can do with it

00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:35,230
it actually the server reference

00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:37,779
implementation itself is available and

00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:39,539
it's PHP which was basically just to

00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:42,279
make sure it can be deployed anywhere

00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:45,070
because yes this has been tested on

00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:48,070
anything from fairly high end VPS is all

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:50,559
the way down to your five dollar a month

00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:53,919
web host all the way down to a Raspberry

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,929
Pi that I've got so it kind of runs

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,450
however you want it to it's just an

00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:59,769
issue of performance really but

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:01,090
relatively little of the functionality

00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:04,539
is affected by running it in very

00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:07,779
restricted environments there's also

00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:10,090
part of the open-source offering is

00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:12,039
client-side applications which are in

00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:14,139
Java these primarily are basically just

00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:15,940
to show off kind of how you can interact

00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:18,549
with the system this way a lot of us is

00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:20,379
demonstrations the capability but they

00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:23,499
do actually work this is providing

00:25:20,379 --> 00:25:27,009
things like if you want to have things

00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:29,190
like file synchronization to a backup

00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:31,629
system that's built on top of this

00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:34,359
that's one of the use cases that I have

00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:35,619
they use a lot for example and because

00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:37,289
that's part of the reference

00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:40,239
implementation this is sort of the

00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:43,210
do-it-yourself Dropbox or Google Drive

00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:45,070
right just get those put it on wherever

00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,809
you've got space maybe it's something

00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:48,309
you're buying maybe it's some friend of

00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:51,039
yours who just lending your web space or

00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:55,570
something and you just kind of connect

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:57,279
the pieces and it'll work there's of

00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:59,799
course the RPC glue layer which is

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:02,289
because all these because it's all based

00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:03,249
around application protocols now well

00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:05,109
there's a way that you can actually

00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:06,519
describe those protocols so this is if

00:26:05,109 --> 00:26:10,119
you would take it and actually try and

00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:12,009
extend it further the actual machinery

00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:16,029
exists to do this for you so you would

00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:19,690
specify VES as some sort of some RPC

00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:22,299
specification written in some simple XML

00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:24,789
file and there's some sort of free

00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:27,340
marker based java support for actually

00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:30,929
turning that into all your incoming and

00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:35,190
outgoing glue code for PHP and Java and

00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:37,389
I keep meaning to do one for Python and

00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:40,210
something which is large something which

00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:41,830
is from an open-source perspective is

00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:43,419
more just an interesting curiosity but

00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,680
it's actually part of the system as how

00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:46,110
it

00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:49,440
deployed which is something called the

00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:51,780
PTP c compiler which is a PHP to PHP

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,520
compiler which essentially just does

00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:56,250
some in lining and dead code elimination

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,990
things because deploying systems like

00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,930
this based around PHP can be kind of

00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:03,330
unwieldy due to include path management

00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:04,620
and things like that so this is this is

00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,750
more something you'd be looking at from

00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:10,080
perspective they had as something

00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:12,570
operate on bison grammar files things

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,060
like that but those are again just tools

00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:17,130
that are available for everybody if

00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:19,080
they're used to that so all that

00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:21,330
information is available it's it's all

00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:24,090
linked through open autonomy com for the

00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:28,400
most part the actual code is all hosted

00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:31,950
out of sourceforge so there any

00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:40,590
questions or comments or ramps or

00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:44,670
anything because I do have like which

00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:50,000
wonder is it in the slice well until the

00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:50,000
next one starts yeah

00:27:50,909 --> 00:28:01,259
yes any questions or anything related to

00:27:53,460 --> 00:28:03,720
this it's got to be something maybe a me

00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:09,090
something but I want you to know the

00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:13,950
difference between the vacation and in

00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:15,929
peer-to-peer hmm appears red so did the

00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,940
last example they dedicated the last

00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:20,309
case for conversion right the

00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,409
application yeah application oriented

00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:26,009
yeah approachable so yeah the difference

00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:27,720
between these of your spirit it

00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:30,059
basically has to do with how the

00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,919
discovery actually works and who

00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:33,269
actually decides because there's the

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,590
issue of essentially what you're

00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:41,669
building is a it's a multi-application

00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:43,409
system with multiple owning users

00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:45,299
effectively is what it looks like so

00:28:43,409 --> 00:28:48,029
each of the components need to be able

00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:49,409
to find each other and they do that and

00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:51,779
also when they find each other they need

00:28:49,409 --> 00:28:53,460
to know how much they're allowed to talk

00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:55,349
to other people like okay if some

00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,659
application starts talking to me as

00:28:55,349 --> 00:29:01,320
another application on a network how do

00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:04,019
I know who owns that application how do

00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,340
I know if I trust them to talk to me how

00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:10,169
do I know that they're allowed to talk

00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:11,879
to me so that's how the and also how did

00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:14,519
it find me so the idea is in those

00:29:11,879 --> 00:29:17,570
situations the components I'll find each

00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:20,729
other through sort of a shared user

00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:23,369
relationship that they already have so

00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:28,169
you issue his service hmm you shoot your

00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:30,599
service for 4 of it for example I can

00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:33,149
see that you can you sucker reference

00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:36,359
implementation so i am assuming that

00:29:33,149 --> 00:29:38,519
behind this application oriented there's

00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:43,159
there's a server behind this that does

00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:46,379
it the bridge between music um well it's

00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:48,809
it's essentially just more of a common

00:29:46,379 --> 00:29:51,419
library entail use like it is running on

00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:53,549
this is just it's running us some peach

00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:55,919
set of PHP applications on top of the

00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:58,289
patchy so that actually does run the

00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,029
this is how it's executing but the

00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:03,419
actual way that the communication itself

00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:07,029
is mediated it is all based around

00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:09,490
essentially what's this one library but

00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:11,769
something me you did mention which I

00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:13,539
won't also point out is that part of the

00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:17,529
advantage of having a system like that

00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:19,510
is that if you aren't exposing any

00:30:17,529 --> 00:30:21,909
services or any can connect any

00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:24,659
capabilities you're just consuming them

00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:27,340
then there's no real need for your

00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:29,799
application even be reachable on the

00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,850
Internet so this is where things like

00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:33,039
you can actually have native

00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:36,880
applications that interact in this kind

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:39,130
of this application mesh which is

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,230
actually alluded to up here the

00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:42,789
client-side applications are examples of

00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:44,889
that how you actually interact with a

00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:47,620
system like this without actually having

00:30:44,889 --> 00:30:49,269
any web components at all like aside

00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,429
from this one centerpiece of it and the

00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:53,320
one and the services that are being

00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:55,179
offered any of the consuming

00:30:53,320 --> 00:31:01,630
applications don't actually even need to

00:30:55,179 --> 00:31:03,460
be running on a web server the does that

00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:05,889
answer does the first part of that

00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:09,669
answer your question yeah I think I'm

00:31:05,889 --> 00:31:12,220
having a hard time understanding how the

00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:15,549
application oriented approach really

00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:23,110
works and then you have your cell phone

00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:26,590
for example why so in the classic

00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:29,200
degraded scenario we will be using for a

00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:33,549
simple server between us or you know

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,649
social servant for example but in any

00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:39,039
are in your application oriented

00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:41,830
scenario I'm having a hard time figuring

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:44,169
out how how it really works for me to

00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:45,200
communicate video I mean for me to find

00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:49,010
you

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:51,860
sent messages are it is it ph appears as

00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:56,000
i said i mean my cell phone communicate

00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:57,649
directly with the our cell phone no in

00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,120
this case they'd all be based on the

00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:03,639
idea that the applications themselves

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:06,529
are finding each other through user

00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:09,019
relationships the user relationships are

00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:13,120
the discovery issue of how you actually

00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:18,980
find other people that like for example

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:23,000
hmmm yeah yeah exactly it is it is a web

00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:25,519
of trust system great and it's just kind

00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:30,679
of how how they step through that it's a

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:32,630
decision I recall this to the radio

00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:34,639
system hmm I wouldn't call this for the

00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:36,950
radio system no candidate but it but i

00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:39,799
think it's a it's a major improvement

00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:43,730
over the classic for the rated system

00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:46,309
scenario which is would you use who have

00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:50,330
a server right and you don't control

00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:52,519
your data sometimes so in your scenario

00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:54,500
you aren't in control of your data

00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:58,309
because you run your own application

00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:00,880
that communicates yeah this is the

00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:04,580
reason why like the reason why this is

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,470
would constitute a federated system is

00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:10,370
because it's a it's interoperability

00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:13,070
between semi-autonomous components or

00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:15,649
any part of this can disappear as long

00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:17,690
as it wasn't the part that you were that

00:33:15,649 --> 00:33:19,850
was the thing that tells you what you

00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:22,610
can do which is a personal connection in

00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:23,990
this case then everything else was still

00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:26,210
work and even if that would happen to

00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:29,179
you no one else who's using any system

00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:32,649
related to this is affected so there

00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:32,649
need not be any connection

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:46,309
what sort of major security concerns you

00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:49,580
how this yeah one of the things that

00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:51,890
I've looked at is first of all I don't

00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:53,809
think that as as an actual

00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:56,179
implementation example I don't think

00:33:53,809 --> 00:33:58,910
that open economy has been pushed enough

00:33:56,179 --> 00:34:02,000
to really get a lot of the examples of

00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:04,429
that flushed out I know that one of the

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,149
one of the concerns I've had when

00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:10,340
looking around at some of the existing

00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:13,520
discussions that that come up come about

00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:15,200
when people look at building how they're

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,669
going to implement a solution like this

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:21,530
because one of them comes up every month

00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:23,780
there's sort of this interesting problem

00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:25,909
they have about deciding okay which part

00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,889
of how many levels of the stack do we

00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:29,869
have to solve ourselves and so some of

00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:32,659
them will do things like say okay here's

00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:34,550
how our encryption system will work or

00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:36,320
this is how our hashing system will work

00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:39,010
or something like that whereas others

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,929
will say okay this is how our

00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:44,149
communication protocol works on top of

00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:47,080
pre-existing SSL connections so they

00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:49,490
assume things like HTTPS already exist

00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:52,399
which is the assumption which an

00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:54,200
autonomy makes as well but that's been

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,490
one of the one of the things I've

00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:59,420
noticed is a big difference between

00:34:55,490 --> 00:35:01,700
these and because it's sort of a hot

00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:04,310
issue it isn't something that I think

00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:07,640
gets as Frank a discussion as I'd really

00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:08,900
like to see because it's very easy in a

00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:12,260
lot of these situations or people just

00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:15,770
panic and say no you need all security

00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:17,300
all the time in all parts and that's not

00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:19,480
the same thing as actually solving the

00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:23,810
problem necessarily it's just sort of

00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:25,600
saying trendy things so but yeah I think

00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,790
that

00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,470
it is an interesting issue because they

00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:33,340
haven't really there isn't sort of one

00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:35,050
answer to it and it seems like there

00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,840
should be a bit more of a kind of common

00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:39,010
baseline decision below this just

00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:45,910
because they're actually all trying to

00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:48,250
do sort of the same thing yeah this

00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:50,230
system is some of those systems are some

00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:53,380
of them some of them actually have their

00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:55,780
entirely own protocols and it really

00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:57,700
just depends on how they wanted to

00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:00,460
deploy how much control they wanted over

00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:02,110
some of the ways the system worked as

00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:06,070
far as i know most of them are using

00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:07,240
sort of an HTTP or https instruction but

00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:11,710
not all them because i have seen some

00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:12,970
recently that don't any other questions

00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:21,670
or comments or anything related this

00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:26,010
yeah the same kind of who is going to

00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:29,860
use this this seems more like an open ID

00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:31,750
person so the same type of person who's

00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:36,670
gonna set up their own open ID server

00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:39,550
with set up something very well that's

00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:43,500
basically no I think that's that's

00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:46,630
pretty those should be repeating these

00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:50,380
for the recording but yeah the question

00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:52,540
was is this situation something that

00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,920
would be kind of targeting the same kind

00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,820
of people who would be setting up their

00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:00,370
own open ID to an open ID kind of

00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:04,930
identity broker and yes they would that

00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:06,820
is these are very similar to in terms of

00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:08,830
I think the mindset regarding the people

00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:11,740
who'd be looking at this as being the

00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:15,640
same you easily be looking at the same

00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:17,980
crowd of people yes

00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:20,890
you think that it would be easy to

00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:25,240
expand the usability over words more

00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:27,040
comfortable with facebook connect or the

00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:32,800
ability for the people who set up their

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:34,960
own system to be able to have their

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:40,770
friends of family as an example also

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:45,100
part of their system or is this it

00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:47,980
you're wanting to make it for more users

00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:49,780
like have you I guess the layman's

00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:53,680
version of my question would be how do

00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:55,900
you time to get a lot more using okay so

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,090
the question is how do you get more

00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,530
users on this kind of system and how do

00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,630
you do things like make sure your

00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:04,620
friends or family for example could

00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:09,040
actually get online with this as well

00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:11,830
yeah okay so in that situation any one

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,690
of these basically anyone could run one

00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:16,180
of these but because whenever you're

00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:18,340
setting it up somewhere it's it's going

00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:20,050
to be some software which runs for it

00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:22,210
doesn't matter how many instances of

00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:24,100
users you have it's just they're just a

00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:26,800
different instance of the application

00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,030
running there so in those cases if you

00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,890
were to take something like say the

00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:33,190
reference implementation it should

00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:34,450
easily on its own scale 2,000 or so

00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:36,250
users before things start getting

00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:43,420
unwieldy in terms of just how it is

00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:45,850
implemented the the actual kind of the

00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:48,070
cost of a lot of the inter application

00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:52,000
connections really depends on what the

00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:53,890
density of that network is so that the

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,150
kind of broader question of scalability

00:38:53,890 --> 00:39:00,040
sort of depends on what you do with that

00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:01,840
this has been sort of similar to some

00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,390
discussions that have gone on regarding

00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:07,270
XMPP because there's big concerns there

00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:11,700
of what the actual can internode

00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:15,280
scalability is and that's also kind of

00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,990
it it's sort of a concern that gets

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,090
voiced every once in a while but it does

00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:24,520
not appear to have really grounded

00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:27,700
anyone so it's there is that issue of

00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:29,050
okay how do you want to build this which

00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,550
does come up but

00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:33,130
it's hard to be able to determine what

00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:36,490
the real limitation limiting factors

00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:37,660
would be because you're looking at okay

00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:39,280
what are the use cases that would

00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:43,240
actually push the network to its limits

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,620
and are those different than these cases

00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,060
which would push a walled garden to its

00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,500
limits as well but because they

00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:50,470
internalize the infrastructure you just

00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,820
don't see where that happens because

00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:53,140
they also have to deal with these

00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:55,500
problems they just kind of do it

00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:59,020
internally in terms of what the actual

00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:05,610
connection between distributed nodes of

00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:05,610
some sort are does that answer that yeah

00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:16,240
okay is there anything else are we good

00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:18,550
sure fine when it's fired the data

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,670
server or figure out ways connecting to

00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:23,860
how does it do that the server

00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:25,420
configuration could change in the sense

00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:34,180
that is there a centralized location

00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:37,330
where the site sign on no be in this

00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:39,730
situation the idea is that it's all what

00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:42,610
you'd actually end up doing is if you

00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:44,350
wanted some sort of white pages so the

00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:46,600
question is how do you actually find

00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:48,040
other other users and how does your

00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,980
client application actually find

00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,390
something to connect to right yeah so if

00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,430
you wanted you could build something

00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,690
that was effectively a white pages for

00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:57,340
this because again you're looking at a

00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:00,220
system which is without central

00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:01,390
authority or structure so there is no as

00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,890
a side effect of the way to implement

00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:04,680
that there is no single place where

00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:07,120
you'd say I want to go find at the users

00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,680
and you'd end up with the situation

00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,120
where you can kind of like you have now

00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,590
with actual data on the internet where

00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,710
there's search engines and things like

00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:16,030
that that connected it isn't all in

00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:20,680
wikipedia even though it might actually

00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:23,080
be so there's the way that your actual

00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,730
clients the client applications know how

00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,110
to do this is because they're all

00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:28,090
connected to an identity and they know

00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:30,640
where that is so that's actually I they

00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:32,880
maintain that connection now how the

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,530
actual identities find each other is

00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:39,100
through the users actually building the

00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:40,900
connections so this is it just means

00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,140
that instead of you know saying oh look

00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,789
me up in this direct

00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:46,700
tree somewhere you'd instead do

00:41:43,789 --> 00:41:49,220
something like say yeah here's here's my

00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:51,470
actual my identity like here's this URL

00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,819
or here's this QR code because we're

00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:57,260
standing in front of each other holding

00:41:52,819 --> 00:41:59,869
phones anyway diagram you had up there

00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:06,319
with three different servers connecting

00:41:59,869 --> 00:42:08,480
to that it's an add-on there's no there

00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:10,309
would be no there'd be no look up across

00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,460
them because they that would require

00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:14,809
that there be sort of a leader now it's

00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,519
possible you could build a system where

00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:19,250
they knew about each other but that

00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:20,869
would be it kind of an add-on is it kind

00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:27,650
of like that sounds like there's no

00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:29,000
central database yeah yes but that's

00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:31,609
actually a very good way of explaining

00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,039
that that it's it's like email in the

00:42:31,609 --> 00:42:35,420
sense that how do you find the email

00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:37,940
address of someone you're looking for

00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:39,470
well you ask them for it and that's how

00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:45,109
those connections are built there is no

00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:47,569
central authority those systems were

00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:51,789
operating on the same name so how do i

00:42:47,569 --> 00:42:51,789
know which instance will connect you or

00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:58,369
they're all completely independent so

00:42:55,220 --> 00:43:00,980
it's not the it's not like you're a name

00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:02,539
it's more like you're it's kind of like

00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:04,430
how with email you have this idea that

00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:06,019
there's a user and a server and that

00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:09,789
gives you your your to level namespace

00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:12,170
in this situation they use URLs and

00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:14,390
those uniquely identify them as well

00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:17,450
because that provides you a namespace

00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:19,339
that's global because of DNS and then

00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:21,710
sub namespaces just because of how the

00:43:19,339 --> 00:43:23,269
server is organized so that way they'll

00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:25,069
end up that they are all globally unique

00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:30,289
as a side effect of that kind of two

00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:33,789
level namespace idea so anything else

00:43:30,289 --> 00:43:33,789
any other questions

00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:39,630
