I'm going everyone hope you hope you

00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:31,190
could hear me I was a bit struggling

00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:34,290
about what the pathetic talk about today

00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:37,350
but I kind of settled on giving you a

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,449
little kiss green on Twitter's kind of

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,690
approach to open source and also a

00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:43,800
little bit about our changes on an

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,360
infrastructure community from the

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,399
technology stack that we kind of started

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,720
within the companies where we are ok and

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,290
kind of tell you a little bit about that

00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,940
story so before I kind of dive in you

00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:57,329
know obviously shameless self-promotion

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,579
here so please tweets I love you know

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,489
reading the feedback hopefully you know

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,860
I can always talk to every every tweet

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:07,940
that isis love criticism and love ideas

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,340
so please please send them my way so

00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:13,619
connections on for the agenda I going to

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,110
introduce Twitter like I'm assuming you

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:20,070
know who doing here has has heard of

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,670
Twitter it was not that's for the better

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,570
question

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,070
yes perfect okay so we'll talk a little

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,340
bit about footer in terms of like how

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,330
how we as a company see see the service

00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,420
and I'm going to dive in a little bit

00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:35,580
about our open source kind of philosophy

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,920
within the company of helped establish

00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,210
about four years ago then I'm going to

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,920
talk a little bit about the history of

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,600
the Twitter stack which is kind of our

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,159
infrastructure and then I'm going to

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,310
wrap things up to Sun you can through

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,649
the box and then hopefully I'll leave us

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:53,310
with at least 15 minutes for questions

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,600
so first up you know what is twitter I

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,119
know this sounds like a very good

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,679
question but from our perspective as a

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,830
company we essentially see it as a

00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:02,729
real-time Public Information Network

00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,380
essentially connect to shoot connecting

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:06,450
with what you find is interesting so

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,580
whether you follow food trucks or the

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,259
economist or you know ever whatever you

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,819
know needs your fantasy but at the heart

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,980
of the service is essentially the

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,700
concept of tweets so technical level

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,750
tweet 140 characters okay not so much

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,410
you know technically about two hundred

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,090
fights but you've been on Twitter for

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,959
all you see that people do interesting

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:29,489
things with the space so I think

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,290
Shakespeare had the old quote I think

00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:33,150
brevity is the soul of wit so in

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,829
committee constraint people could do

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,299
interesting things within that beam so

00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:37,410
this is kind of what my favorite whole

00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:40,799
twitter accounts that all they do is

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:42,570
just like see you ask a our goal medical

00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:48,810
use kind of like harkens back to the old

00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:51,150
days of SD are so scale Twitter so we're

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,730
basically doing over 500 million squeeze

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:57,120
a day do some math that's about three

00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:59,640
half billion per week so you know decent

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,250
amount of traffic if you do a little bit

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:07,290
more math steady state that's about six

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:09,150
thousand leads per second the

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,090
interesting thing about this is

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,519
it's not always a thousand per second

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,310
there's an earthquake in this area near

00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:21,000
the San Francisco office 30 seconds we

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:23,129
obviously go up my favorite a scenario

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,280
is you know that the Conte demonstrate

00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:27,900
this problem is in Japan huge users of

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,310
Twitter love it I guess cuz they

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,689
probably you know it's you know

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:35,939
described more in the short medium that

00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:38,340
the language but a few years ago there's

00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:40,859
this famous anime show you know

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,500
Miyazaki's a very good cuz you can't

00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:45,090
remember them but custom skies movie

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,569
this is the first time it was going to

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:51,060
be displayed on TV and people really

00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:54,450
stoked and for some reason someone

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,829
decided to you know get everyone

00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,090
together and say there's a certain part

00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:58,379
in movie when you know they're basically

00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,849
gonna like you know attack dislike

00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,769
floating castle bring it down and they

00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:03,959
Nathan eight and they say something i

00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:05,609
don't know japanese that well but you

00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,709
know i said she translated to jump to

00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:09,480
twitter but essentially they they all

00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:12,239
stay at the same time at this moment in

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,319
the movie and they did a first in 2011

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,419
when we had no idea they were going to

00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:19,199
do this and you know it absolutely like

00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:21,959
destroyed in all these five thousand pay

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,570
per second it's in seducing contacts you

00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,280
know New Year's Eve at least 130 not

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,570
less your news new years he was thirteen

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,409
dollars per second so it's pretty

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:36,900
considerable and the funny thing was

00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:38,370
they decided to do this knocked over a

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,139
little bit more prepared and organized

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,419
and Twitter was much much much larger

00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:43,949
service thankfully at this time they

00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:46,260
also changed the way our like technology

00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:48,539
stack worked so like you know I don't

00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,990
think you have a loyal that often these

00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:53,080
days but we didn't expect this a lot of

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,340
traffic but we were

00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,620
want a parrot on an engineering

00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,889
perspective and your kind of handle but

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:04,960
it was it was a hell of a surprise okay

00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:06,430
okay goodbye farewell so enough enough

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,199
of like what is better i'm sure most of

00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:13,150
you understand kind of how the service

00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:14,319
works but when i first stunned one of

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,310
the first things I had to do when I

00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:19,629
joined twitter was to establish program

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,569
office with an accompanying trying to

00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:25,289
dictate whatever philosophy would be and

00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:28,110
part of that was defining set of

00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:31,750
optional operating principles we should

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:34,090
everything assess as a company and I'll

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:38,639
go through all these but the first one

00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:41,590
is pretty simple pretty straightforward

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:47,529
generally I think companies and people

00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:48,669
have it early it generally like that you

00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:50,469
know if endings are scratched you know

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:52,779
they call it a naive syndrome and so by

00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:54,939
default a Twitter we basically force

00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:57,099
everyone to use open source software

00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:59,050
they can if they kind of want to go on

00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:01,960
their own and create some new like key

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,940
value store a better benchmarking

00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,930
against you know you know the popular

00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,610
with your projects would be something

00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,529
similar and prove that we are actually

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,089
creating you know could be the

00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:12,460
performance of something that is spoken

00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:15,550
and may have a large community behind it

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,379
that you could benefit so it's basically

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,900
there so we don't read that so pretty

00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:21,370
straightforward most companies try to do

00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,759
these days these days I'll poke at least

00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:28,810
you never know and kind of as a result

00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,830
of this philosophy we generally pretty

00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,289
much majority of the Twitter

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,169
infrastructure is running

00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:35,819
focus for these days so I mean this is

00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:37,860
just like all the cool open source of

00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:40,409
project logos i could find it's like I

00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,029
could cram in one slide but we

00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:43,129
definitely run more than this but you

00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:46,559
know there's some examples that we

00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:47,969
Jenkins for continuous integration labor

00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:50,759
combination of puppet chef I actually

00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:53,189
publish up Hannibal on the back end for

00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:56,009
managing servers just a node in there

00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:59,159
but mostly as a kind of little internal

00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:01,349
tools or a huge on JD and shopping days

00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:03,779
they run it over the JDK is per source

00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:05,099
control rail skills existent and so I

00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:06,689
could you of course for long-term

00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:09,300
storage I'll go through some of these

00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:11,879
some technologies later but I've been a

00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,699
 feel free to ask questions I'll

00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:17,009
answer devotees but the kind of next

00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:20,580
operating principle as a company that we

00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:22,830
come up with is you know you never want

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,119
to open source something that makes

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,279
business value you actually want to make

00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:29,309
money business value and I was stuck

00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,569
just people being employed so I put

00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:32,189
every visit in this philosophy like you

00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:34,439
know if you define your secret sauce as

00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:36,389
a company that is much easier to have

00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:40,939
discussion of what you get both in

00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:43,620
verses you cannot and within the company

00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:45,930
for us there's there's a few things I

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,430
think that mean put our unique is you

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,069
know there's not many companies that

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,589
operate on us on our scale so software

00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:54,559
that may always uniquely scale through

00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:57,430
our knees maybe maybe secret sauce

00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:59,860
obviously our ad platform everything

00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:02,170
twitter.com the structure that's all

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,770
secret but everything else essentially

00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:07,330
is pregame to open and so within our

00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,310
engineering organization we allow

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,930
engineers that really you know open

00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:13,030
things and it makes the conversation a

00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:15,340
lot easier of patient week openness or

00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:17,830
not if it's you know the secrets also

00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,210
defined body look at your company so

00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,910
kind of another reason why the majority

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:24,160
of our stuff out there is is open source

00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,810
and so like I said you know your secret

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:32,230
sauce and makes that conversation much

00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:33,670
easier Oh another story so you know it's

00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:36,370
another story how this works this is hot

00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:39,580
so a few years ago I couple engineers

00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:41,860
come to me and he said hey Chris me 10

00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,960
sources you know google CSS for a month

00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,450
right all blueprint and you know I'm

00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,820
like an old leg Linux you know Colonel

00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:52,180
like JDM guy these days so my fellow

00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,500
front and stuff socks hate this kind of

00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,360
it looks like their stuff out there like

00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,300
this there's no really secret sauce

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,790
involved here and so we opened it but

00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,780
you know as as part of opening it we

00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,490
have a change of name blueprint

00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:06,790
trademarks we were named the project to

00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:09,400
the bootstrap and they became the most

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,930
popular project on get up just

00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,390
absolutely crazy me but I guess people

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:15,110
really ain't writing like what you eyes

00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,029
so

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:19,459
and now I don't know now I know you

00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:21,529
distract myself but as of course of this

00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:23,480
we also open sourced a lot of other of

00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:24,829
our front-end technologies because your

00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,750
Twitter's our service we don't you know

00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:29,029
because the way we structure our

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,700
JavaScript code really like secret sauce

00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:33,589
No so we opened up something called

00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,450
power which is a package manager giver

00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:37,130
for the JavaScript practice kind of like

00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,380
npn but more focus on the client side

00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:44,540
stuff and flight which is just kind of

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:46,640
the way the structure or the other thing

00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,560
we do is you know as a side effect of

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,950
you know being a gold being pretty open

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,230
and opening these technologies is you

00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:56,360
want to assume that what you're working

00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,920
on in term may be looking source later

00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,019
on that's kind of like within our

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,029
culture we have this cake tin where you

00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:03,560
pretend that like you know you're not

00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:04,790
you or did you and your team are

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,019
knocking the only people i look at your

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,700
boat it's actually gonna be everyone

00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:10,459
essentially in the future so let me make

00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,410
sure that it dependencies on animal

00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:13,820
basis we don't like try to like bring in

00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:16,430
the whole world and it kind of keeps our

00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,630
quality early not really high-end when

00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,430
we go to go to source things that makes

00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,839
a lot easier because you don't have to

00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,430
drink in the whole world or actually you

00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:23,949
know what was just a complicated

00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:28,240
licenses

00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:28,240
makes life a lot easier

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,710
the other thing we do it is when you

00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,480
open source something got open source

00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,490
some are right back in a day this is

00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,779
much harder like you know I Bobby I was

00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,490
talking about like Gophers that looks

00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:47,230
sweet how many people remember that

00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:49,180
stuff but but these days these days we

00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,550
hope to get out it's it's you know it's

00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,959
generally where many people accept

00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,029
what's the largest social coding site

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,279
out there the tools are pretty good you

00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,540
know i like them personally but on a

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,490
statement office or something you might

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,649
use something that and the 40 people use

00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:05,020
these is and actually lower the barrier

00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:07,930
contribution for your project so we

00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:11,920
absolutely love working with them or you

00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:14,080
can give them a correlating to this is

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,430
febrile you know open source how many

00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,880
ways right like then you can like maybe

00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:20,589
over sir just up at apache awesome we

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,600
love open source foundations but we

00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:25,209
prefer not to actually start our

00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,130
projects there we prefer to first focus

00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:28,570
or someone get up see if we can build a

00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,830
community around and see if there's any

00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,709
traction are we actually solving

00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:34,660
something useful to the world or is it

00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:36,400
just useful to us it doesn't get any

00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,720
traction you think it's better to kind

00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,000
of fail fast and say okay it's probably

00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,830
kind of probably gonna die out if a

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,020
project grows and gets a huge community

00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:45,850
okay even have larger companies of all

00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,550
that so you eventually may want to move

00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,560
to a neutral independence foundation and

00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:53,800
kind of establish a better reference for

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,750
positives essentially our philosophy on

00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,060
that we love we love our fans that like

00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:01,510
apache of somebody's foundation HD

00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,950
sponsors the other thing we do in

00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,590
regards the licensing

00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:07,300
so open source license amy is always

00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,970
like a you know heated discussion

00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,540
flavors of the source attention not

00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:16,090
dragged myself down getting through that

00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:18,190
wonderful session but within Twitter we

00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:19,720
essentially default permissive licenses

00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:23,440
for the majority of our open source

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,180
software the reason we do this is our

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,590
general goal when we open source

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,720
something a Twitter you want pretty much

00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:31,540
everyone to use it right like we want to

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,640
minimize the barriers of you the infuser

00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,260
software so you proper larger company an

00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,000
easy way to do this is the different

00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,310
permissive license so something like MIT

00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,530
or ESP or patchy pretty much you can do

00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:43,450
whatever you want sauder the code so

00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:45,820
we're comfortable with that you can give

00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:48,460
a little bit of the role during that but

00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,170
not too much so we prefer that we want

00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,440
the community to flourish around our

00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:55,420
project and one interesting thing is

00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,560
google this actually is happening the

00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,240
straightest like an older slide i

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,460
probably should have removed it but

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,340
whatever you know there's been a trend

00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:05,760
of overtime that popular press not copy

00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:09,250
left on poppy left licenses tend to be

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,480
growing at quite quite a large pace and

00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,720
i think a lot of that needs to do with

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,690
it it's just easier to use software as

00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:19,360
legal issues but one of my favorite

00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,580
quotes recently is no key no anti res he

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,600
is the lead of a key value store

00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:28,570
progress kind of crazy italian guy but

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,100
one of his blogs he was like you know

00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,480
debating about like you know the nature

00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,520
of open source and all this warm stuff

00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,320
and one pretty good quote that kind of

00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,420
stuck out to me which kind of course

00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,220
cons to my own personal

00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,450
it's like first of all open source of me

00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,190
is not a way to contribute to free

00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:43,200
software necessarily but it's a way to

00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,370
trick me chica manatee this means a lot

00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,050
of it you know this means a lot of

00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,910
things because I don't really care what

00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,380
people through with my code North they

00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,089
release back of modifications I just

00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:53,040
want you know people use my foot one way

00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:55,139
or another in any kind stays with like

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,779
especially I really want people have fun

00:13:55,139 --> 00:14:00,570
learning stuff make money with my coat

00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:02,370
and for me other people making money out

00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:04,769
of something I wrote it about something

00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:07,709
I lost is something like it and so it's

00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:11,010
kind of my personal feeling and also

00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:14,220
subscribe for instances the other thing

00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:15,470
we do is I don't know how you know how

00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,180
many people aware but there's kind of

00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:20,010
you know hot this around like you know

00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,660
actually hiring companies so it's really

00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:25,050
hard to find telling these days and so

00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:26,790
it's common to hire a very small company

00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:29,070
with a few engineers or noble titles

00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,990
engineers and just apartment for the

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,000
talent person necessarily software that

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:36,449
they've developed overtime and so we

00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,389
have a policy to always include open

00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:43,019
source in any you know M&A original neck

00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:46,230
position discussions you know it's it's

00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:47,730
sad to see could go two ways right so as

00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,940
a result of this policy we had a couple

00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,589
acquisitions that we actually open

00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,600
source the whole thing so we parted

00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:57,240
company called whisper systems they

00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,980
develop this really cool android kind of

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,350
a Christian so I've secrecy related

00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,449
software so you can make you know you

00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:06,050
know we're having the calls but also

00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:06,050
centrally

00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,800
all that stuff and that's all on github

00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,300
and actually it's like a queue it's like

00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,720
it's huge i think is always included by

00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,250
default if you unlock here in richmond

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,200
and cytogenetic actually texted

00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,420
directorships they're like ball mount so

00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,370
school things what happens when yoga

00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,200
games the other other thing was we just

00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,120
acquired like a handful of engineers

00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,890
disk or they wrote this little you know

00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,650
cute little bubbly be testing framework

00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:33,740
very cool but we just wanted to you know

00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:37,910
part them and so ended up doing we ended

00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,200
up with sourcing their software and you

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,610
know some people use it but what was

00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,040
interesting about this case was there

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:45,620
gazing competitors in industry and they

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,640
basically took their software and was

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,650
they were they were able to write a

00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,780
quick migration from you know what you

00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,250
know from their existing framework to

00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,320
you know there are other competitors

00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,340
framework so existing customers that

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,050
were using this one left in that

00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,460
position virtually people to migrate

00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,290
actually had a couple choices to go so I

00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:03,130
I found that actually fascinating

00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:06,680
because I never even saw that happening

00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:09,650
the other kind of important operating

00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,760
principle dinosaurs is we have a

00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,680
possibility captain measure everything

00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,930
you know measure you know you know

00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,220
anything essentially it might be to have

00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,630
no idea what you're doing I can't

00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,390
benchmark yourself because I you can see

00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:22,340
a new idea for me or not been Twitter we

00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:24,770
have this internal system actually

00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:26,090
called bird brain and essentially it's a

00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:28,010
system where everything is measured

00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:31,070
within a company from like the amount of

00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:33,279
tweets and you know toronto or Ottawa to

00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,959
amount of like you know the source usage

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,870
you know different language usage out

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,269
there so it's probable if we're playing

00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,680
you know anything about this is all

00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:43,329
employees have access to it internally

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,310
so they can actually see what's going on

00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:48,999
so unfortunately I can't share with you

00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:50,379
but I'd said it's definitely need and

00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:53,740
finally like that I think one of the

00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:56,499
most important things that we operate a

00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:59,740
mom is the kind of kind of kind of the

00:16:56,499 --> 00:17:03,309
notion of paying it forward so I think

00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:06,100
it's incredibly important this out there

00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:07,569
and supportiveness or software Manning

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,280
is actually embedded in our lives or

00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,870
where the people realize these days if

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,220
you look at your if you go to feeling an

00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:14,049
iphone or android phone about your

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,699
settings you get it legal and you go to

00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:18,220
legal notice that it's just like a crazy

00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:20,919
moments or software that shits on your

00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,750
phone also a lot of party spaceship with

00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:24,010
a ton of code like there's some some

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,990
second cars out there like women

00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,089
procedures like 20 millions lines of

00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:30,220
code in their cars and there's a ton of

00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:32,049
the source stuff dioxin ships with the

00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,280
scar singer she go to them and request

00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:35,110
the manual that lists all the

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,289
open-source offer that the suction pine

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:41,110
boggling but from from our perspective

00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:42,850
as a company for Twitter it's like you

00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,590
know we're in fortunate position where

00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:47,110
she support these organizations

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,820
and we do like it is it make sense for

00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:52,600
us but we're also able to hire people to

00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:55,270
so use for example a lot of new software

00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,620
in order to do long-term storage well we

00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,150
support a Duke and stuff like that makes

00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,320
it easier to hire folks because they

00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:02,260
actually want to work at a company and

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,549
supports open source so he actually

00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,799
don't have to do this financially to you

00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:07,480
basically have both work on it sort of

00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:10,779
your companies that you simply throw a

00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,990
silly are my chances so that's

00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:16,690
essentially our open source operating

00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:18,549
principles that Twitter there's not too

00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,350
many but the most things that I'm really

00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:23,529
proud about this is that actually fit

00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:25,419
easily went to be a chevelle common

00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:28,590
woman does actually apprentice actually

00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:30,730
start with fictitious take one tweet so

00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:33,159
so now we're going to talk a little bit

00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:36,279
more about kind of technology and sort

00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:38,799
of stuff behind how good it works how

00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:42,100
its kind of them all over the years do

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:46,360
this no fun for me this was lost people

00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:49,600
itself so in 2006 the service started as

00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,490
a very simple idea right okay I just

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,980
wanted it will send status updates right

00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:56,020
you know nothing really special there

00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,399
it's very kind of humble beginning even

00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,130
a long time ago i bought like twitter

00:18:57,399 --> 00:19:01,940
was I was like blogs Twitter like Ric

00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:06,409
alone but now

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:08,870
like I received for everyone but but the

00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:10,940
technology stack at that time really was

00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:13,940
very simple so like it was basically a

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,649
rails app you know with my sequel for

00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:19,220
storage and it was basically remember

00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:21,019
eels app and so the outside of this the

00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,299
downside of this I'm in here American XL

00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:25,100
for architecture and everything was

00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:27,169
monolithic so basically our routing

00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,519
presentation logic all big Nick Daman in

00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:31,279
our storage kind of like pushed on the

00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:32,539
side on kind of okay to start out they

00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,519
build something quickly but if you're

00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:36,679
going to have a large team and other

00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:42,289
things it's hard they can also model

00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:43,940
Victor basis go skate so in 2008 this is

00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:47,750
when the fail will became I think Amos

00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:49,970
lots of people put us down again good

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,409
times but actually probably helped our

00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,389
press a little bit I kind of helped me

00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:56,059
company all these this organization very

00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:59,230
much deep down negative press like no

00:19:56,059 --> 00:20:01,820
questions to do it by so eventually

00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:04,519
everyone started to like okay we need to

00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:07,070
fix me to fix us that and so we started

00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:08,809
the higher you know more people we ended

00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:10,159
up with a lot of like you know it could

00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:11,750
too many cooks in the kitchen price

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,789
which many engineers working in like one

00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,409
model dick good basis hard to serve

00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:18,679
great responsibilities and get people

00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:20,360
ownership and have mature owners and

00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:21,980
things storage and we've got a little

00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,990
bit smarter zit okay we can like an

00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,490
something you know like anyone to you my

00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,259
sepulveda basin be itching to start

00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:30,110
charting and clustering so we could also

00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:32,760
cool things around that actually cash

00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:36,060
things yes oh my gosh like

00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:38,040
either cash tweets memories so actually

00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,260
these days like the majority of tweets

00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,320
you know that you'll see online or like

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:45,380
on your phone or whatever are all caches

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,090
ginormous Redis cluster there's no

00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:51,870
students having to give details for that

00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:53,660
so Mac for a story 2009 I think is

00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:56,010
really like the inflection point like

00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:58,110
lots of crazy things happening the world

00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:00,180
the revolution started happening and the

00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,980
reason Twitter all search so the amount

00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:05,240
of Swedes are happening where it is just

00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:08,220
just just a hard problem and deal with

00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,970
2010 was really really sad times at

00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:15,420
twitter so i don't remember old pub

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:21,300
basically anytime a goal was scored this

00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:22,410
service would go down and so yeah so

00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,910
there's like there's like if you like

00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,530
search like you know world cup 2010

00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,360
twitter you'll find the articles like

00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:29,130
people in rotor socks i could always run

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,350
down technical glitches as they call

00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:33,140
them but like it was just devastating be

00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:40,140
watching like you know the whole cup and

00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:41,400
no don't scoop so click what was

00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,140
actually wrong with you know with this

00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,570
whole egg model of the grill theft and I

00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,490
approached the software so and then

00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,710
enter the code based on Olympic so we're

00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,300
busy like managing you know into this

00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:53,880
database connections we're using that

00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,860
pouch behind so our caching layer we're

00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,390
rendering a site healing API calls all

00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:00,510
within the same all of the nicest a

00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:02,010
model of it stacked we were actually

00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,270
growing machines of the problems away

00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,980
it's just five more machines what's

00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:07,770
morally a real hundred-person uniform

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,420
over you're good to go that as expensive

00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:11,880
by and we're also very we're also

00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,800
trapped and would like to stay in

00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,690
optimization corners so we were

00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,650
essentially doing some crazy things in

00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,600
rails or basically

00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:21,790
writing likessee extensions to like make

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,020
certain aspects of parsing plaster

00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,460
because you can do it faster and see

00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,190
that you can do it groovy it was just

00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,540
like ending update is just a bad bad

00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,850
place from the for an engineering

00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:33,010
perspective it's also funny actually

00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:35,080
internally organized what we call like

00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:36,640
Waylon things with expedition so I one

00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,350
that is asked like all the blood world

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,240
tough disaster came we were designed

00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:42,700
small team cigar like okay what that

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,050
actually have been did I mean everyone

00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,050
else is supposed to keep this eye level

00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,660
so eventually we can to the point that

00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,190
we we understand we wanted to

00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,080
reinvention assistant like they made an

00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,430
opportunity to like design everything to

00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,250
scratch and you know now that we're

00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:59,560
bigger company what would we do so first

00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,330
step was wanted huge infrastructure it's

00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:05,020
like we want to reduce the amount of

00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:07,120
machines by penpal or by 10 x and we

00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:10,900
wanted wins all across the border going

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:14,110
towards the other thing that we want you

00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,550
know wanted to kind of deal with is when

00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:18,160
you deal with distributed systems

00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:19,690
failures and everyone we have hard disks

00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,280
that fail you have data centers that

00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,620
light on fire all these crazy things

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,900
happens so if you can isolate your

00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:29,680
failures into smaller subsystems it's a

00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:30,850
little bit easier to do failure and and

00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,500
also more importantly from an

00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:36,640
architecture point of view when i start

00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:38,890
isolate our users are picturing to like

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,230
well clean defined services we have

00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:42,670
service every angle authentication and

00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,770
other servers on handles Patrick are

00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:46,990
their service and handles users and so

00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:50,770
honestly what a nice was a couple level

00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:53,380
it's nothing new its software Canadian

00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:56,200
literature for multiple multitude their

00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:58,990
kids at this time they also start the

00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,640
repair like a certified like ruby was

00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:02,650
going on so he started to evaluate

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,200
things based on you know hey how much

00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:06,880
much CPU usage is being done Madame and

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,920
network delayed us off with an Iranian

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,110
ah stack of time and essentially our

00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,090
rail machines were doing push the limit

00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:16,120
on cpu and ram Berg absolutely like

00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:17,950
pegged out but the networking kind of

00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,210
layer in review part I was absolutely

00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,820
terrible time and we're getting about

00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:24,070
two to three hundred requests kept on

00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,960
her host on rail which is like

00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:28,870
absolutely atrocious if you're a lot

00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:32,830
better in many other languages and so

00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:35,080
like okay and putting some map it's time

00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,520
were like okay so like are you so you

00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,770
know usage earth for this kind of like

00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,330
this if we kind of do the math if you're

00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,860
how much machines it takes to kind of

00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:44,230
catch up with this it's going to become

00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:49,060
really expensive so we need to all this

00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:50,830
problem soon soon at it later so at the

00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,180
time we also started to experiment a

00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:54,460
little bit with the journey on so we

00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:56,470
hired a couple companies or we acquired

00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:59,800
a couple companies one that kind of

00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:01,690
specialized in search and they built a

00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,430
pretty impressive search infrastructure

00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:06,880
I'll probably seen about you see there's

00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:10,810
a pretty great way index index documents

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,860
or tweets in this case we also start we

00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,990
also had a team that started to

00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,370
experiment in a language called scallop

00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:17,440
which is a wonderful

00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:18,790
programming language bill bone in GBM

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,730
and they go better essential graph

00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:23,680
database using spela and you know at

00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:26,830
this time the performance for these

00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:29,470
services that were pasted up on Twitter

00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:32,650
worth were absolutely destroyed what we

00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:35,110
had erred rails like well is like JDM is

00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:40,540
not so bad is not only for like an old

00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:42,280
people so let's check it out so so we

00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:45,070
started to like Arliss let's move to the

00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:48,130
JDM there's a huge community on it has

00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:49,600
you know so like a huge amount of PhD

00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,620
research when it's performance you know

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,800
a lot of paintings and what other

00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:56,620
companies are allowed to during or you

00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,630
know they're sailing these huge open

00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:02,830
source ecosystem i probably won awards

00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:05,260
largest out there you know it topple

00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:07,960
artists and the other thing that kind of

00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:09,640
attracted us is we like to kind of use

00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,679
multiple languages within twitter so the

00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,860
fact that you can run things like you

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:17,340
know scala java python and so on on top

00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:20,220
of the JDM and it all cause on the bike

00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:23,700
runs on just one virtual machine was a

00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:28,260
huge huge kind of address so all right

00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:30,470
let's let's rock out in Virginia we also

00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:33,180
started to decompose the model

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,740
application number into different

00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:37,710
services and we kind of did this based

00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:40,140
on the Cornell's of locates operating

00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:41,760
Twitter underneath seems so there would

00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,860
be a service for tweaks like a buncha

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,530
for everyone for timeline that EMS and

00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,840
so on so we kept decomposing the service

00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:50,790
in a very piecemeal fashion we didn't do

00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,850
this super quickly we started with basic

00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:55,920
basic things so these days now like

00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:57,930
clear I'm on a very high level like

00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,520
rotting separating to its own layer we

00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:02,150
have our own fancy reverse proxy based

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,710
on many presentation has its own layer

00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:07,230
all the logic now is separating two

00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:09,270
different services storage pouch pen or

00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:11,810
pencil is very much for much larger but

00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:14,430
doing it this way we're actually able to

00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:16,050
keep parts of the MA so you know this

00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:18,450
picture you have like the monorail still

00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:20,730
exists in some small form we were able

00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,350
to get there by iterating one by one by

00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:23,730
turning things into certain like small

00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:26,280
services versus trying to do everything

00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:27,720
in a wholesale fashion I think I've

00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,940
tried to rewrite everything to stretch

00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:35,160
without going in a piecemeal fashion he

00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:37,050
probably would fail so let's take a

00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:39,450
little peek of similar technology like

00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:40,830
we have a ton of stuff we makin source

00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,220
but i kinda want to focus some of the

00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:44,320
infrastructure

00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:48,690
done they don't probably wrap things out

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:51,669
that you probably fixing questions so

00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:55,650
with distributed systems and you know

00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:57,760
kind of losses you know couple services

00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:59,620
converging currency becomes like a

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,900
non-trivial problems if this art and

00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:06,640
what happened is each team that start to

00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:08,559
build on the JDM so they're like

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,480
different approaches on how to handle

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,610
failover and retry all these other

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,640
things that get to do under services and

00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:17,049
so we're like okay this is this this is

00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,549
not good right you want you kinda want

00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:19,780
to standard either standardize on this

00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:22,480
because i'll make the bugging you know

00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:25,750
maybe four people two teams so we

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,570
basically these failure domains is we

00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:32,500
forced us to create a library to handle

00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:35,130
this for us so we essentially created a

00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:38,110
project called finagle which is built on

00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:40,720
scala of course in any as humankind

00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:42,760
network migrated vanadium but it's

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,620
extensively used for us every time you

00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:47,200
like use Twitter's in fashion during

00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:49,120
your hitting been able makes a fax

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,760
service quinones for the thermostat

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,470
people they're using been able to back

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,750
us so we need custard there was that

00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:57,039
your plan with angle soundcloud and

00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,510
fourth graders and some other companies

00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,370
out there it is available but that's as

00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:02,590
important as kind of programming models

00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:04,990
though finagle essentially takes care of

00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:06,640
all the nasty like killer demeanors

00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:08,230
design part about but also things like

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,620
service for secretary load balancing

00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:14,260
retry and so on and essentially the

00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:16,510
programming model it is very functional

00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,610
and it's also based on the concept of

00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:20,509
futures which are essentially ways to

00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:24,320
delay let's say believe

00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:26,599
mutation or delayed actual execution and

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,989
it's very you know stackable and n

00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:32,329
modular and asynchronous is kind of a

00:29:29,989 --> 00:29:35,479
key thing I'd you go a little bit more

00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:37,820
into detail the detail this but it kind

00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:41,809
of takes a deep dive we basically have a

00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:43,339
we open source a lot of our experiences

00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:45,799
and moving to scholars and the things

00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:48,499
we've heard and to start like philosophy

00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:50,989
of currency and how to deal with it it's

00:29:48,499 --> 00:29:53,059
on get up i recommend taking a search of

00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:54,849
equus calibike better go find it is not

00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:57,019
that hard I'll dive a little bit deeper

00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:58,849
another thing that happens is once you

00:29:57,019 --> 00:30:01,819
start on having these loosely coupled

00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:04,429
services it becomes really important to

00:30:01,819 --> 00:30:06,979
start being able to trace them and have

00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:09,499
metrics and introspect them so an eagle

00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:12,639
adds the ability to look into into

00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:14,779
tracers into your services and so

00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:16,729
typically thing becomes visual about

00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:19,819
visualizing these things so we developed

00:30:16,729 --> 00:30:21,669
a technical source of melty calls again

00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:24,199
which is based on the googled a

00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:26,539
particular II gave out there essentially

00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:28,789
is a debilitation of that and it

00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:30,829
basically allows women to you look at

00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:33,440
service pulse so like some have your

00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:35,719
service and you saw that it went and

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,339
executed this query to the database and

00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:39,319
it hung there for this time you know

00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:40,639
this amount of time before it really

00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:44,089
information back will give you a nice

00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:45,229
hole beautiful trace of you know how

00:30:44,089 --> 00:30:46,579
long it took the certain things of you

00:30:45,229 --> 00:30:49,129
within your service so you guys you

00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:50,250
having point you know you know what's

00:30:49,129 --> 00:30:53,650
taking long as you

00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:55,179
that's a phenomenal phenomenal piece

00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:58,480
technology that helped us iterate on

00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:59,620
performance issues every time the other

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,270
thing is like like I mentioned earlier

00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:05,110
like we store pretty much everything

00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:06,429
into a tube like scribed logs everything

00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:09,040
approved all of traffic light

00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:10,540
information goes into a new marketing

00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,030
cluster is actually much larger than our

00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:16,390
actual talk you know cluster were like

00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:18,700
tweezers for my sequel the problem is

00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:20,559
once he starts ornamentation he needs

00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:23,260
that I like she equerry it and like do

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,850
cool things with it I know if many of

00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,640
you have any experience writing but you

00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:29,830
plug not for these jobs but writing it

00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,630
using either Java or like pea gradient

00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:35,799
like the little scripting language out

00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:37,840
there it is praetor so we basically fell

00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:40,090
in love with Scala at the time and

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,790
decided to build a solid ESL that gives

00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:44,230
you a nice like functional programming

00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:47,049
solidest way to write the new jobs and

00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:48,880
it's super concise compared to other

00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:53,559
solution other adults i'm kind of is

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:55,450
offensive da the final thing that we

00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:58,559
kind of did which I wish I had a little

00:31:55,450 --> 00:32:00,970
more time to talk about but all of it is

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,530
so you know you have to post these

00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:03,820
services and software somewhere in your

00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:06,669
infrastructure right so you either

00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:08,919
hosted mcleod at us or where do you want

00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:11,440
to do it but I Twitter we we run our own

00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:13,679
infrastructure right it's you know we're

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,410
a size it makes sense to do that

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:19,660
traditionally the way this has been done

00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:22,570
in the industry is it's a common for you

00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:24,520
to statically partition machines within

00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,169
you know your clusters that yep these

00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,030
set of machines are like you're my

00:32:26,169 --> 00:32:30,630
sequel or your database servers these

00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:33,280
are your caching consisted

00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:37,360
library or Wales boxes are so on seeing

00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:39,010
a partition out your data center based

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,520
on like your knee based on your needs

00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:44,080
the problem with this approach is your

00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,210
utilization profiles are different

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,190
pretty services so for example so you

00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:50,200
have your huge a new cluster partition

00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:52,570
that 1l and maybe you have patched jobs

00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,460
ever on @midnight that they help the

00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,620
amount of users there are or build these

00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:58,240
are in topic models so you could

00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:01,390
actually recommend some people on

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,970
clearing that usage profile basically is

00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:05,410
I pay machines use that midnight and

00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:07,390
then not really use that much anymore so

00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:09,730
you have a lot of wasted resources

00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:11,140
they're cashing service or different

00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:13,150
there will be more utilized so on so you

00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,140
have all these different locations for

00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,490
calls and we notice with our

00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,930
infrastructure there were actually

00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:18,580
wasting a lot of resources it like this

00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:22,210
is like this kind of sucks it's not any

00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:24,610
better way to potentially do this so we

00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:25,450
went out did some research like hey what

00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:28,270
up you know what are the people doing

00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:29,500
out there so it happens to be that our

00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:31,060
friends at Google were definitely ahead

00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:33,340
of this game and came across this

00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:34,840
problem a long time ago and they wrote

00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:37,360
this kind of very famous paper to call

00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,700
the data center as a computer which i

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,140
recommend almost everyone in here should

00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:45,540
kind of read it for super interested in

00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:48,310
infrastructure and we're like okay cool

00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,600
like you know is anyone else you know is

00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:52,090
there anyone doing research in this

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,400
field and we started to collaborate with

00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:57,760
a friend separately in black is an

00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,500
awesome institution I vertically that

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,960
focused on

00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,490
I think the related problems and there's

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,470
a couple researchers at the time that

00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:06,570
were kind of doing things kind of

00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:08,690
related to what Google described in

00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:10,800
their paper they were mostly focused on

00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:14,280
it's funny at the time there once they

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,530
focused on just just like just like one

00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,360
like machine with multiple course so I

00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,919
had like machine as a cryptic words but

00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,840
if you take that concept that might

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:23,760
treat cores as you know a generalist

00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,370
data center those businesses whether far

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,379
so we partnered with her folks on aunt

00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:30,899
lab and we decided to basically take

00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:32,940
this research and turning to a

00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:35,639
legitimate open source project and kind

00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,990
of build a community around it and I

00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:40,440
finally feel our article there but if

00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:42,149
you just Google for a goal they'll find

00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,040
it but essentially we created possible

00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:45,780
basis for those who are the kind of nice

00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,460
people and term people kind of

00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:49,110
understand how this works as the best

00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,810
way to describe it is if you have a

00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:53,820
single machine right on running legs

00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:55,740
there's something called secrets which

00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,290
basically allows you to partition a

00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:00,900
machine into very interesting ways so

00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:02,750
like the partition against like if 16

00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,190
cores maybe I want to turn that into

00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,720
four machines that have four cores each

00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:09,740
and you know did yoga strap so you

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,990
basically video machines in two

00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:15,350
different pieces and this is what makes

00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:17,670
us does it does that for the whole

00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:20,310
cluster of machines that you add

00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:22,890
tomatoes and what it does essentially

00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:24,630
surface like one giant machine

00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:26,550
essentially so like to be like hey my

00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:28,140
cluster has like is when you CPUs

00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,940
available this much around available as

00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,370
much heart is available as an engineer

00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:35,400
when you like write your service within

00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:36,810
Twitter or whatever else where we say so

00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,630
if you essentially just specified okay

00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:41,730
my service as much CPU in this much RAM

00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:43,430
and bases will go figure out where to

00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:45,530
run it and

00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:48,550
and pretty much your seminary and what

00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:50,420
happens with this approach is that

00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,800
you're basically able to more

00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,569
efficiently utilize your infrastructure

00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:56,210
because it's not visas won't allow you

00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:57,559
to waste things based on them up like

00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:59,180
the static permission model when it is

00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:00,589
dry the port so there's actually a lot

00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,720
more in depth that you could you know

00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:04,280
that you could dial in this but it's

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,170
like I think the future of

00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,550
infrastructure will will move in this

00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:09,980
direction because right now there's a

00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:12,200
lot of waste and data centers and I

00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,609
think we do better as you know not only

00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,140
as like a company but it because I

00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:19,579
society that we don't want like bird was

00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:21,170
necessary energy so I'd in a day like

00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:22,250
you know to save the pocket money with

00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:24,079
this approach but like you basically

00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:26,720
reduce your capex on topics by combining

00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:31,640
and you're different utilization

00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:33,950
profiles aterna maximize them so kind of

00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:36,260
you know endings so a lot of people i

00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:37,670
say i didn't tell any more hope yeah so

00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,500
you know moving our infrastructure to

00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:41,270
the GBM being a little more mature about

00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,950
things and having things like a nice

00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:45,430
loosely coupled services is helpful also

00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:48,170
our success rate super fantastic today

00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:49,970
our performance requests per seconds all

00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:52,490
that stuff has you know who stood

00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:54,589
performance is pretty good today twitter

00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:57,619
hardly probably goes down anymore I can

00:36:54,589 --> 00:37:00,410
see how much but as a company um we're

00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:02,960
over 3,000 employees now we have a

00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:04,280
policy as a company culture since we're

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,329
very light engineering and metrics

00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,579
driven is to make sure that how the

00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:10,369
company is engineering so fifty percent

00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:11,079
of company company it is engineering we

00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:14,440
have over

00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:16,150
70 million how users i could do tuesday

00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:19,839
like i mentioned four tons of trees

00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:21,700
house of tweezers cent per day oddly

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,369
enough semi percent users clearly use

00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,959
twitter upon a mobile basis i think this

00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:29,709
is a common trend anyway like it's

00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:31,630
interesting to see that web usage over

00:37:29,709 --> 00:37:33,789
all across everywhere is kind of going

00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:36,009
down when you are using one things be

00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:37,569
immobile so this is funny too because

00:37:36,009 --> 00:37:40,479
like he leads to make jokes deadly

00:37:37,569 --> 00:37:42,249
follow links links on the desktop right

00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:43,900
but like they actually need desktop is

00:37:42,249 --> 00:37:46,239
mobile now so i think like my nexus tiny

00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:49,839
windows android is pretty mounted in

00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:52,989
that space maybe it'll happen but back

00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:54,609
to after this so we have well over 20

00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:57,519
focus which projects that we focus or

00:37:54,609 --> 00:37:59,609
slow rotators do so including thoughts

00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:03,819
before i open things up for questions is

00:37:59,609 --> 00:38:05,140
number one on a base open source as a

00:38:03,819 --> 00:38:07,900
company we would not be where we are

00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:10,209
today it may be not very simple source

00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,249
from the beginning i think most press

00:38:10,209 --> 00:38:14,019
the best debris solutions these days are

00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:15,579
open and on top of that you get to take

00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:18,400
advantage of the community effects by

00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:20,619
having a lot of people outside your

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,549
organization workers stuff and all that

00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:27,549
stuff so also i think a lot of people

00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:29,920
don't embrace academic research as much

00:38:27,549 --> 00:38:30,700
and order would be able to scale a lot

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,339
of it

00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:36,369
you can have a close partnership

00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:37,780
berkeley heights of this folks are in

00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:39,849
turn these systems and open source

00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:41,320
projects so definitely collaborate with

00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:46,530
that Khadijah they actually work on

00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:48,550
pulls up second incremental change wins

00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,810
you know at the time where Twitter was

00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,250
failing over we did it shows to lie

00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:53,740
completely throw everything away and

00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:56,200
start from scratch we decided to do it

00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:58,720
the very few female fashion and just

00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,690
like you know anything you know by doing

00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:05,250
small changes and a passionate reminders

00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:07,540
so if you go one approach is going bad

00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:09,160
you know you find out how much earlier

00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:13,660
without affecting the rest of the system

00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:15,790
so huge digital and finally think I'm

00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:17,710
wrap things up is I think you know the

00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:19,420
approach i described as you know you

00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:21,160
know training your data centers like one

00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:22,750
ginormous commuter but computer and

00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,849
having a very smart schedule or decide

00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:27,490
to you where to run things i think will

00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:29,829
be the future of infrastructure it saves

00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:31,480
money you know it produces Catholics on

00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:33,880
topics for companies and also it just is

00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,710
more green in my opinion so i recommend

00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,119
you take a look at this approach because

00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,920
i think this is where the future

00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,040
infrastructure will go and other

00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:45,670
companies will start looking at this

00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:47,560
approach other than that thanks for

00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:49,839
listening you know my barometer for a

00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:52,060
successful tech talk is essentially have

00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:54,390
you learned something new i'm happy feel

00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:57,720
free to tweet at me or email me at

00:39:54,390 --> 00:40:01,230
aconitine anything always respond to my

00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,609
emails so they're nuts thank you very

00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:06,150
much and also had a bunch of resources

00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:07,740
to i'll post them a bit but how about

00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:13,519
let's do some questions to be fun other

00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:13,519
questions better cook yes medevac

00:40:13,549 --> 00:40:18,269
microservices about some of the band you

00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:23,609
have a lot what what you mean when you

00:40:18,269 --> 00:40:25,079
say Elijah services I mean those terms

00:40:23,609 --> 00:40:27,839
are completed essentially I would say

00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:30,420
microservices it gently it serves one

00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:32,730
main purpose right so like even have a

00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,829
service like all service right handles

00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:37,260
just purely authentication that's all

00:40:34,829 --> 00:40:39,029
abuzz it's like 11 simple like you know

00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:41,369
method called about even validate

00:40:39,029 --> 00:40:43,079
whether users Authenticator not see how

00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:44,819
the user service actually handles you

00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:47,029
know like sort of the user registry it's

00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:50,400
all about things having one purpose

00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:51,539
essentially makeup I stuff like the

00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,000
terms of continuity because like you

00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:56,430
know you know 15 years ago we were

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,809
working on microservices on the like JDM

00:40:56,430 --> 00:41:00,240
that we're trying to bed and like both

00:40:57,809 --> 00:41:03,059
cars and stuff like a these terms like

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:08,089
resurface every every so often so it's

00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:12,710
not as nothing new any other questions

00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:17,660
yes I'm great talk their interest

00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:22,040
good good I don't twitter so I'm

00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:24,109
certainly disadvantage that's fine as I

00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:27,410
understand it Twitter on its face is a

00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:31,089
really simple syrup and if it all this

00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:34,190
complexity is doing besides scale scale

00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:36,020
yep scale it's really scaling right you

00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:38,450
know you get to a certain size you can't

00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:40,190
really just like use something off the

00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:43,160
shelf price so we have people with that

00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:44,390
Twitter that work on the colonel work on

00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,550
my seagull they're actually like

00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:48,380
committers and they basically help tweak

00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:49,790
these technologies to eke out a little

00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,859
bit of performance like you just can't

00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:53,540
have you know an engineer that you know

00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:55,160
download this and sets it up and running

00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:57,530
actually need people really close to the

00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,599
code and the project really understand

00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:03,619
how things work to make it work at our

00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:05,480
scale this thing's all over and I got

00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:08,060
the kernel level like a like a one

00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,109
percent increase in a kernel around like

00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:11,450
I don't know the way and you'll never

00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:12,800
hear something so our requests so get

00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:22,339
homework press per second will save us

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:26,810
money is a huge benefit how many what

00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:30,360
boxes I mean we have multiple data

00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:38,640
centers and we're family Sheriff

00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:39,930
Oh a lot it's a considerable sum like

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,910
you know some people things like this

00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:44,100
tweens itself they're pretty simple

00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:45,480
right like you know a character storm

00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,010
but there's also a lot of things

00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,180
associated with tweets to like when you

00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:51,420
point when you send a tweet sometimes

00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:52,890
people have pictures right or videos so

00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,960
you have to sort of those video is the

00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:57,480
pictures and like a lot of videos

00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,770
pictures being in a sense so it you know

00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,200
that's another challenging problem they

00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:02,910
have to do it on geo related information

00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,130
to and always seems like you have to

00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:07,770
store them for them and also make them

00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:09,690
efficient officially queryable right so

00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:11,790
we have a mask platform that you know

00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:13,740
people we have software behind the

00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:15,270
scenes that essentially you know a

00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:18,480
Twitter we don't ask what information

00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:19,980
right you can sign up with your name or

00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,950
whatever it is used to choose to be

00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:25,020
right you know Cookie Monster a an email

00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:26,640
and maybe a phone number and that's it

00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,410
so as a platform we have to basically

00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,090
figure out what you're interested into

00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:31,500
right and we kind of use that based on

00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:33,360
to your Pollock to try to basically

00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,610
topic model is hey if you call like the

00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,800
eponymous or some sporting a movie like

00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:39,780
Proctor's driver you like news and so

00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,070
that stuff takes a lot more work in

00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:43,980
engineering part if I figure out those

00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:45,450
models and then have an advertising I

00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,190
could do that so there's a very non

00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:49,070
trivial thing to do this in a real-time

00:43:47,190 --> 00:44:05,849
fashion is not

00:43:49,070 --> 00:44:08,400
has three letters yes we street so this

00:44:05,849 --> 00:44:09,390
would I some of that's not not

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,260
necessarily like okay sort of

00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:15,240
essentially we we we ship like hundreds

00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,190
of times on a daily basis right and the

00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,540
way the way we get around this is like

00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:20,700
of course would contain information that

00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:23,010
like checks for build failures Anders

00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,560
test ever on a test form but the way you

00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:27,359
can get on this we have notions of

00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,550
something musical pre-flight but

00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:31,950
basically ways works is first changes

00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:33,599
get you know first all changes have a

00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:35,910
notion of feed replies you can disable

00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:38,369
them at any time but they slowly roll up

00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:39,960
so I'll first go out to employees you

00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:41,970
get to play with things then they'll go

00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:44,190
off maybe like twenty one percent users

00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:45,780
than one-percent users the five percent

00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:49,200
represents was a slow rollout of

00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:50,760
teachers and and honestly since we're

00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,619
constantly almost about putting our

00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,470
service and like easier dog vendor

00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:59,339
service we catch most egregious mistakes

00:44:55,470 --> 00:45:01,410
before they infect the jury that's kind

00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:03,270
of help like I guess like active soft we

00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:07,020
combined with like he's at the moment

00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:09,380
practice of lexi is testing all across

00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,380
the slope

00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:40,560
absolutely it's animal is all

00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:43,350
automatically the way actually makes

00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,300
those works is if she need less talents

00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:47,400
people because naso is does a lot of

00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:49,590
that work for you there's no like here

00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,600
can you like statically like hey I need

00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:54,690
some new machines for this new thing

00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:56,430
right asus has a ginormous poll you just

00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:58,980
basically it means you're the poll you

00:45:56,430 --> 00:46:01,560
asked for it I don't give it to you so

00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:03,380
you actually need less sres or adults

00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,790
type of type of boats with that model

00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:08,160
but the cast won't you stop school like

00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:09,540
like probably just randomly picking out

00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,610
things we do a little bit like you know

00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:13,140
before like the wolf up this year we

00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:16,740
obviously like try to like purposely

00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:18,840
take down parts of the side or how much

00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:23,160
scales but we don't have anything like

00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:24,480
super fancy automated school idea that

00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,160
it's a good idea that we also terrified

00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,740
ago so what is there now I'm always

00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,160
trying to let you know this just took it

00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,160
down ourselves

00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:39,010
yeah what's next all open source project

00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,840
you really have your eye on something

00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:47,040
that you think is going to be important

00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:52,840
in the future it's a good question so I

00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:55,390
I would say is that a couple one so I

00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:59,440
think there's just their students the

00:46:55,390 --> 00:47:02,620
one I think I think the time that we

00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,480
have to write native so like Mobile's

00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:06,160
huge now right like like the majority of

00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,710
the world is starting to interface with

00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,060
the web via mobile device and they'll we

00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:12,220
actually some people that grow up that

00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:15,910
this is the only way they have interface

00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:17,950
interface with the fact that we have to

00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:20,860
write like native applications for each

00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:22,330
platform it is tragic it's a huge waste

00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:24,040
of engineering resources you just need

00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:27,130
to hire someone that specializes in iOS

00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:29,400
vs android or versus whatever Microsoft

00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:31,360
uses for their further stuff so I think

00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,620
the dinners there's no particular

00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:35,290
technologies out there there's some

00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:37,840
attempts like Cordova phonegap someone

00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:39,790
will eventually solve the problem of

00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,260
having a very high performance like

00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:43,870
web-based HTML page where you could

00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:46,900
write app and run it across different

00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:48,340
mobile devices and I think that's

00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,930
something like I haven't found that

00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:53,140
something that's all it'll provide that

00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:57,010
would be what now I definitely report on

00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:58,750
the infrastructure side I so there's a

00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:00,670
project called auger which on the huge

00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:03,430
fan of that I think is going to change a

00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:06,250
lot of history in terms of how actually

00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:08,260
packages up applications the docker I

00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,820
don't think souls of our 12 I think the

00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,780
quarter Pole and offers like how do you

00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,650
actually orchestrated all these

00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:14,690
different server

00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:18,080
so packaging is only like what software

00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:20,480
is a very creative this is a couple

00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:26,020
figure I don't don't ask that sounds

00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:26,020
good any other questions yes German back

00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:38,420
european yep why well there's a couple

00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:41,660
of things so you have the benefits of

00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:43,190
network effects right services kind of

00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:46,340
at you someone at social networking away

00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:48,620
in the concept of polymers and honestly

00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:51,350
kind of your powers but I just think it

00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:54,860
solves it an enemy if it solves an a

00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:56,000
problem that you know people not to some

00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:57,560
people just like they're like broads

00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,360
like broadcast messages right like

00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:01,310
people like to share information which

00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,690
is cool but it's done in a way that

00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:05,660
essentially makes it uniquely

00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:07,760
addressable across the world right so we

00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:09,650
actually don't release content meat is

00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,940
the first medium out there essentially

00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:12,460
allows you like broadcast message

00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:15,230
messages and also have a uniquely

00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:17,780
identifiable identifiable feel like a

00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:20,870
URL or something right and you know like

00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:22,460
we used to have these things like like

00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:24,410
news wires and stuff like that used to

00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,640
exist right and soul you know critical

00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:27,800
problems but they were never publicly

00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:29,750
addressed my first want to do that and I

00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:32,120
think you know is a huge value to

00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:33,560
humanity I think we want some bumps you

00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,180
know whether whether it's in a Torah

00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,990
forever but some service like this will

00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:40,100
exist big assault assault assault you I

00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:43,250
don't that was a good answer but it just

00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:44,300
kind of see it some people see Twitter i

00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,280
was like that it's a gun once like a

00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:50,260
short short shorter version an email

00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:50,260
that's probably addressable tutorial

00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:58,610
yes just one more shirt you see we had a

00:49:54,650 --> 00:50:02,960
chart that children excluded yeah yeah

00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:05,090
so what was that eventful I was in

00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,500
multiple best people started like riding

00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:08,030
all over the world for all you know

00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,440
there's egyptian riot loss of it was

00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:13,700
like two thousand two thousand nine ten

00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:15,290
was really the like huge spike so i

00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:17,750
think part of that was just plain old

00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:19,490
network effects and this ottomans are

00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:21,710
some countries out there that have

00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:23,180
incredible amounts of like like twitter

00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:24,980
twitter usage like you're getting in

00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,970
asia is like one of our largest you know

00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,890
it's clear users and they're always

00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:29,750
early on sandwich upon adjusting each

00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:31,970
country it's different but I think that

00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:34,460
combine network effects we also combined

00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:35,780
with you know creating revolution other

00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:38,000
things that's like to use into the

00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:40,130
services actually does show one value

00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,280
where you know you may be in a country

00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:45,260
where your press as you know the presses

00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,050
run differently and being able to

00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:51,470
broadcast messages unfiltered fashion is

00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:53,780
huge one of the reasons I still enjoy

00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:55,700
working at Twitter because I think you

00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:57,530
know it too helps enable that which i

00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:59,540
think is valuable valuable service in

00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:00,830
strategy there can be sick think if you

00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:02,600
said there is something said about it

00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:04,640
being like you know all of you know ads

00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:11,180
pay for bills at the other day but you

00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:14,090
know it is value service yes um yeah so

00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:15,710
I mean while I don't dis create this is

00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:19,220
actually really valuable contribution to

00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:20,660
humanity um and feel free to skip this

00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:23,510
because it's a really complex ethical

00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:25,160
question but there are two sizes coin

00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:27,140
right i mean however we were hearing

00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,790
time time again that now vehicle is kind

00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:31,220
of this driving engine not only for

00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:34,700
these peaceful revolutions but also for

00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:37,250
a lot of radical groups and propaganda

00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:39,050
and and it's it's affecting the Western

00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:41,450
world almost as much as it's affecting

00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:45,380
the developing world so was was there

00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:47,090
ever a discussion internally of any even

00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:49,220
width of a consideration to start

00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:52,359
policing or any filtering or any of that

00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:55,509
or governmental cooperation to it

00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:58,390
so a lot of this is public but we do

00:51:55,509 --> 00:52:01,720
respect the laws of countries we operate

00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:03,670
it so for example we have something

00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:07,779
called country with Pelton contents so

00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:10,619
in some countries like say Germany and

00:52:07,779 --> 00:52:13,930
Switzerland there is a notion like

00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:15,369
anti-semitism is just like it's this big

00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:17,470
thunder wall like this is not allowed

00:52:15,369 --> 00:52:20,259
like an oppressed right or anywhere I'm

00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:23,499
so if I don't give you legal order you

00:52:20,259 --> 00:52:26,529
have to respect that so all the time the

00:52:23,499 --> 00:52:29,349
mechanic money came a finger to your

00:52:26,529 --> 00:52:31,480
perspective so we did we do have these

00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:34,599
debates and so the solution I we kind of

00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:39,009
developed to deal with this is so in the

00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:41,529
case of say Germany or Switzerland if we

00:52:39,009 --> 00:52:44,980
get a legal order we will we will

00:52:41,529 --> 00:52:46,630
respect it we operate in Germany and

00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:48,730
what we'll do is we develop this country

00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:52,210
with health content things so the tweet

00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:53,650
will essentially be met the new flag is

00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:56,140
like it won't be shown I'll be like hey

00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:59,230
this is thuy husband with hell in this

00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:00,730
country and will link the legal order so

00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:02,769
it gives me anyone from Germany you know

00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:05,529
what we'll see that however if you were

00:53:02,769 --> 00:53:07,269
from outside like the you later in the

00:53:05,529 --> 00:53:08,589
US or Canada if you would actually

00:53:07,269 --> 00:53:10,930
you'll actually see it you won't have

00:53:08,589 --> 00:53:13,539
any ideas actually with bells so for us

00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:16,989
you know we came up what we thought is

00:53:13,539 --> 00:53:19,569
like a clever legal hack is they still

00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:22,539
enable free communication across the

00:53:19,569 --> 00:53:23,920
world but also respect the laws of some

00:53:22,539 --> 00:53:25,900
of the countries that we operated an

00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,450
enemy that's kind of but in terms of

00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:29,950
like propaganda members not like it's a

00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:32,410
communication meeting right just like

00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:36,530
anything like me like a press

00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:38,900
phone our hope is that since treats are

00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:40,100
like real time and fast that you know

00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:42,620
even though you may have propaganda

00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:45,020
probably a good kids career God gets you

00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:47,120
know corrected quickly because treats

00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:49,220
come from over the world sort August you

00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:50,840
know by that fact hopefully anything

00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:53,540
that's completely propagated we get

00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:56,630
something to be self-aware I don't that

00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:59,570
make sense but that's he's my cousin

00:53:56,630 --> 00:54:05,170
you're probably in any way and spam some

00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:05,170
people think yes the other person I mean

00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:12,530
he's your foot persist my timeline

00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:14,630
crossfire oh okay this actually I've got

00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:16,310
is like wizard-like blots this there's

00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:19,250
some others from party service that the

00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:26,000
world was there at least Nastya verify

00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:40,250
to verify what's up let's work and

00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:43,550
brought down but I don't think so he is

00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:44,840
entertaining actually carry out there

00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:45,950
the other thing i'd recommend you later

00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:48,230
question about the whole propaganda

00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:51,200
thing for all the legal things that we

00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:53,420
get we transparently publish them so if

00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,070
you go to chilling effects org they

00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:57,470
essentially like me pub leads we work

00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:59,240
with this independent patient to publish

00:54:57,470 --> 00:55:01,220
all these things occur wins

00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:04,060
by the late hi things I mean we do stand

00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:04,060
