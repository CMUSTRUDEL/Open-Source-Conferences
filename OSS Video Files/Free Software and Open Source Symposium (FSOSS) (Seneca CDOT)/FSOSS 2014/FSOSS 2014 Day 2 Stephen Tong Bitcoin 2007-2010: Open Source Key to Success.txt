Steve is currently completing a master's

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:59,969
of information in my auto my interest in

00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:04,250
it coin is made we have a comedian like

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:07,320
a challenge of currencies yeah today

00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,270
unfortunately I don't like not a coder

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,690
so I'm approaching this from like a

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,430
historical fact that you could say

00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:16,860
interest in open source so over the

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,870
summers turn like kind of an

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,150
introductory of course on open source

00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,580
called special topics understanding open

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,130
source software and amazing in that

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,470
course that basically have open source

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,270
really is just like a buzz word that

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,490
came about from like the crazy ones I

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,979
love and actually like both indirect

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,680
practices to me trace

00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:38,149
like even could you see is that like a

00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,490
good author on that it's like fun

00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:42,740
employees and a lot of like talking

00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,840
about innovation and also during that

00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,780
course we just read a lot like

00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,200
foundation of text like where's your

00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,850
balls

00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:55,610
Eric written in it which is solving

00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:57,500
season ideas and so you have the purpose

00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,539
of this termination and basically to

00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,429
prevent like the research I did in that

00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:03,020
course and I'm basically just looking

00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:05,170
for a little bit of constructive

00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,170
criticism

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,970
yeah I just I'm just wondering like

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:21,530
almost so yeah I'm not going to get

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,780
another like 10 best place to do it but

00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:27,230
basically it's just a decentralized

00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:30,920
currency and MIT Lexus that started in

00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:33,769
2009 so far it's pretty successful so

00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,470
let's just look at the price it's funny

00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:40,420
which is kind of like

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:43,140
like so in July 2010 it's like the

00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:47,500
market buying price to like four cents

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:50,170
in March 2013 that grows like this so

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:59,410
it's kind of like this like crazy and

00:02:50,170 --> 00:03:01,360
that's me bacon chocolate this is more a

00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,310
more recent price chart it kind of shows

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,080
that Keith at a thousand dollars and

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,270
today we're sitting there at around like

00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:11,530
they'd 404 Community College

00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:13,840
and this is just a graph of transactions

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:17,200
per second and corn and right now it's

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,520
roughly loading up around 80 passive

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,730
transactions per day

00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,370
and just to give like a little

00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,810
perspective on that I still principal in

00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,370
the vehicle so if we compare that to

00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,470
like I made an effort like the deeds

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,260
that they do four million transactions

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,420
per day so if one still has like some

00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,170
time ago he wants to be like consider in

00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,530
the daily

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:41,530
so the scope of my paper was basically

00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:43,720
like how a point you can get into

00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:47,130
something like it solidarity how do you

00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:50,739
why is it it's like successful basically

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:53,140
this length based finish this led to an

00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:56,530
interest in a software Bitcoin that runs

00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:59,210
it so quite basically when you use

00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,580
Bitcoin you're basically acting like as

00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:05,210
paper and you're supporting the cable

00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:07,610
network but everyone who uses it point

00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:12,320
based education to make software is

00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:14,570
somewhere and a coin software and I was

00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,610
going you also sometimes referred to as

00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:21,380
a stripper she client it went you to

00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:23,330
your big boy boy yeah the software was

00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,920
it takes the rules of Bitcoin but the

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:31,010
Bitcoin or a cause of just serious

00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:34,610
secure all of that is handled in the

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:36,800
software and I just want to understand

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,200
how this help appointment from like an

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,730
experiment that's something like a

00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,950
admit currency into play

00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:46,790
apparently expressed for $20 on the

00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:51,200
night isn't it and my focus is on the

00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:55,190
years 2007 to 2010 particularly on be

00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:57,410
anonymous trader Satoshi Nakamoto just

00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:59,690
like so that's your Nakamoto kind of and

00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,900
there's a table in the whole world so

00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:05,630
like he's the guy who invented it and

00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:08,750
proposed that but nobody knows who he is

00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:12,020
even selfish bed earth India me is it a

00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,700
group that nobody understands which is

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,950
passed to let me speak up in holding on

00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:22,280
them anyway he like owns many bitcoins

00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:24,590
probably like 14 billion dollars and

00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,380
this is just the white paper that

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:31,480
started all clearly here here version of

00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,480
electronic cash which allow online

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:39,820
this is how the software looks like if

00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,530
you download it and you guys are kind of

00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,300
familiar with Bitcoin you know that is

00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,740
not where it's kind of like racing to

00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,920
run you can have to download like a

00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:50,800
20-bit file which is like a record of

00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,500
all transactions ever and this is done

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,810
so that all so I guess you're

00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,960
decentralized network so all you know is

00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:01,420
agree with each other and this is a

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,450
little technical but this is kind of

00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:09,580
like eight point under the hood you can

00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:10,990
say basically I guess the most important

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,690
part would be like the consensus

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:16,330
critical part kind I like that arts to

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:18,520
develop or present a point all the

00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:21,700
Bitcoin software experience each other

00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:26,230
and any consensus on that is a hard

00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:29,980
thing okay so these are the sources but

00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:33,460
I looked at for my research I look at

00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,930
all the cartography male or females so

00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,670
this is where the project was first

00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:40,570
announced and they're roughly around 30

00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:40,900
to email I looked at it coin mailing

00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,240
list

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,849
there wasn't much year they just stopped

00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,520
you making

00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:51,869
like a dozen emails and that was

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:54,149
actively January to March 2009 and like

00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:59,369
the meat of the research I got to do the

00:06:54,149 --> 00:07:02,639
Bitcoin or forum post about the one I

00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:05,490
Satoshi Nakamoto or anyone see what

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,759
folks say that respond to and that's I

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:11,279
was dropping like 300 points and I was

00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:14,550
just like consulted you too and like

00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:17,129
various video sites and news sites to

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,439
look at emails like current developers

00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:22,259
and people who are involved in the scene

00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,619
without age have a kind of like

00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:26,639
interacting with it in the early days

00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:28,199
and also there's a whole bunch of

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,939
mislead you but that's majestic

00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:36,449
reminders like a lot of conversation on

00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:38,519
the appoint happen on IRC without any of

00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:42,479
that and there's a lot of forum posts by

00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:46,289
other developers or emails between

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:48,360
developers and also later on their

00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:50,430
system complex the Bitcoin mailing list

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,610
which is where all those other things

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:55,860
happens as my email and I just didn't

00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,009
look at that because I I decide Michael

00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,009
Bisping

00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:06,630
there could be other person specify

00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:08,700
basically planted probably website so I

00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:11,130
kind of have like a small picture why

00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:17,100
they kind of have successful but I gotta

00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:19,110
say it was I four main findings once

00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:24,330
where he was actually brilliant in terms

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:26,340
of design and coding later but even and

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,650
brilliant as he was he kind of made it

00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,020
successful on the scale is today that a

00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:34,290
community helping him and contributing

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:36,330
and realize the project and the three

00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:39,780
that incredible time cared for Bitcoin

00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:41,910
was in the summer of 2010 and I was

00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,340
really like a lot of things kept about

00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:47,960
meeting at that time I would say it's

00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:52,980
fun if it's consider it a legitimate

00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:55,770
universe and also my last point is that

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,520
the departure of Satoshi in 2010 was

00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,520
actually a good thing

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:06,690
so before we go Ethan at that point I

00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,190
just wanna like cover like bring history

00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,960
to chlorine unlike

00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,940
ideas without electronic passion that

00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:17,640
right he made too much in nineteen

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:19,740
eighties and nineties so look like

00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,780
looking back it seems like they all

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,810
wanted electronic currencies almost were

00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:27,350
like oh anarchist and this was like a

00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,320
yeast connection of people and like

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,600
discussed on the Internet

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,269
and basically things like phenomena's

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,089
remailers they're all like political

00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:38,620
angle but like we can use technology to

00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:40,720
make the world a better place little

00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,610
thing and yeah they want that kind of

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,500
government power and you're like when

00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:49,029
this censorship they wanna be able to

00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:51,190
we'll get past it and reading from like

00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:53,829
especially one of them 2008 in a sense

00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:56,290
that electronic currency will be

00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:58,449
inevitable so this was like in the early

00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,889
nineties like people are saying oh this

00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:04,029
is a can happen for sure

00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:05,949
like it's just a matter of time and so

00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:07,750
one of the problems I think point is

00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:09,670
that there's a recognition that actually

00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,589
really hard to implement a digital

00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,209
currency

00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:15,970
Timothy a who's kind of active in but

00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:17,620
out of these things or it was his famous

00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:20,259
where's my life change don't try a

00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,810
second there's like a lot of challenges

00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:25,690
and make me uneasy

00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:27,579
and so there's I always say there's like

00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:29,110
three main problems that you would

00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:32,769
encounter when trying to create an

00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:34,389
eternity the first one being security so

00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:37,089
I can just write on a piece of paper

00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:39,279
like hundred dollars but no one's going

00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:43,839
to want to trade with your college where

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:46,240
it has deep copy another problem is

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,630
these days why don't you want to use an

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,100
electronic one make merry

00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:53,970
there isn't much reason that you have to

00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:59,830
like I mean I just in terms of the

00:10:53,970 --> 00:11:02,590
economy State and the muscle issue of

00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:04,090
modality and this was in both ways like

00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:06,340
governments can make something when we

00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:08,560
go but if you think about the money we

00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:11,380
use today we're actually required to use

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,660
it for like the purposes of Taxation so

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:19,030
there's no reason to impose a point

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:21,250
anyone and yes so a lot of attempts that

00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:24,550
great digital currencies before that was

00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:27,400
to just be considered behaviour I looked

00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:31,570
at three of them so did you cash eagle

00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:33,450
with your third and basically they

00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:36,010
couldn't find a space they went

00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,300
especially did me past there was like a

00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,920
lot of buzz surrounding black company

00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,510
but should learn to paint breakfast with

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,840
it

00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:44,790
and also be Malaysian eagle and

00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,530
liberalism

00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:50,260
just recently I guess 50 years ago about

00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:52,540
shut down because they were suspected of

00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,880
facility facilitating of money

00:11:52,540 --> 00:12:02,010
laundering and so they're just the

00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:06,680
domain II God sees also but few more

00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:10,790
unemployment ideas like I guess both

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:12,680
you highly the abyss recent activities

00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:14,689
you prove everybody died and they say

00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,490
both I don't realize about anyone in

00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:20,990
this moment you know but they're not

00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:23,499
considered are these esteem of you think

00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:29,329
oh oh they're considered to be like

00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:31,929
Bitcoin like that and yeah many of these

00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:35,660
offensive very many people can say they

00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:38,540
lots of make money even this series

00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:40,160
either way guy and they say both of them

00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:46,819
probably are Satoshi

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:49,160
I don't and so I looked I looked at

00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:51,290
these things be money in pickle and the

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,149
main reason they weren't successful

00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:56,079
because their creators they've had

00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:59,329
enough motivation to go through with it

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:01,429
so when people asked way that what

00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:03,139
happened is my twenties like by the time

00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:04,939
I finished writing up the money

00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:07,550
I didn't perceive that situated once

00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:09,980
implement contract so much attention and

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:14,209
they use be honest logarithm part course

00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:16,429
items similarly makes they both says

00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:20,240
while the security is very hard to turn

00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:23,269
feel so he says like yes dirty stuff but

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,279
even harder than security wide yeah

00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,779
everybody concurrent up to general area

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,540
kind of a very bad idea

00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:31,429
so basically we've got two people who

00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,189
are discouraged say well there's no

00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:38,300
reason straight desolate and then so I

00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:39,649
guess a long time Satoshi I mean it's

00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,929
hard to say how does it came up with

00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:45,170
this for all we have this forum post but

00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:47,170
basically we didn't even make sense I

00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:51,180
can kind of have a flash of light comes

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:55,059
in it's like oh eight point

00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:57,790
like I could do this and the way he

00:13:55,059 --> 00:14:01,240
proved himself he could do this is that

00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:03,399
what on the on the court says I had to

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,050
write all the code backwards perfect

00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:07,089
I tried all the codes before I could

00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:09,639
convince myself that I could solve every

00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:11,529
problem and I wrote a paper so I find

00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,509
this pretty significant deserves like a

00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:16,990
lot of motivation on the part of Satoshi

00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:18,959
and that he was more fun you Carnegie is

00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:23,319
more different than anything important

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:26,709
and like just getting back about like oh

00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:30,339
like open source theory this is like

00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:33,279
certain my working point in the 2007

00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:35,050
served with a plausible promise this was

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,029
like described by narrating the internet

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,589
like they've got to before any open

00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:41,199
source of project kind of get solved

00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:43,089
it's an active control chains we're only

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,670
like one or two before we're hearing it

00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:48,639
or like some others but then once they

00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,350
get that idea up a larger community if

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,170
it's good enough it's going to survive

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:55,769
like some kind of commissary thing to

00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,769
make everyone

00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:03,679
okay so now I'm just gonna get into like

00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:08,689
why so she ate like brilliant in the

00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:10,789
first place so when reading the post by

00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:12,889
Satoshi is actually pretty striking so

00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:17,119
much for that before it's the design of

00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:20,029
it we actually thought a lot about three

00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:21,709
years kind of previous electronic

00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:24,109
electronic currency to a coordinate

00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:27,319
point and we had like some hearts

00:15:24,109 --> 00:15:30,529
birthday but then why is more successful

00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:33,259
so a lot of people automatically dismiss

00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:35,539
in currencies with a lost cause of all

00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:37,489
the companies that fail since the 1990s

00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:39,319
but it's obvious it was only in a

00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:41,299
century control nature of their systems

00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:43,129
that Duman I think it's the first time

00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:46,579
we're trying to think Sonny what not

00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:49,639
just being system so he clearly has like

00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:54,739
some ideas of why people fail and why

00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:56,720
she's gonna be successful at 17 but it

00:15:54,739 --> 00:16:01,209
is a Satoshi and that's like a male I

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:07,100
don't like things just a cookie sheet

00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:08,660
and yet they're that he's considering

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,449
their background is shutting down the

00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:14,059
project and you got some words to say

00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:15,649
about that as well governments are good

00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:18,439
at pointing out the ends of a centrally

00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:20,509
controlled Network like Napster but a

00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:22,570
community computer network like new

00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:25,000
color towards you some people

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:27,340
their own so basically you can see that

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,210
he's already inventing the system to be

00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:34,450
like everyone I guess

00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:37,870
and also my own observation is that the

00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:39,850
source code is so widely available and

00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,280
it makes it even harder to shut down so

00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:45,070
basically it's distributed and

00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,590
decentralized and you can see this with

00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:50,740
the phenomenon known as alt coins which

00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:53,800
are basically like copies of bitcoins

00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:56,410
that certain changes maybe some more

00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,510
radical than others and those are really

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:00,190
think enough is like literally like an

00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:03,190
Allpoint created every day

00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:06,449
and this is just like kind of a few

00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:09,910
boards of like alternative currencies

00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:13,510
like light points like a big one and you

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:15,070
know going on and having fun and you can

00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:17,740
see like all these other ones trying to

00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:20,320
like get market share so I would argue

00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:23,410
that because we have things like all the

00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,060
points like it makes trying to shut down

00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:27,220
the employee kind of pointless because

00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:32,050
everyone just like switch to a null

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:34,010
point and the relevant means one does

00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,740
not simply take something

00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:38,600
like you can't really like do anything

00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:43,760
at this point to like stop it because

00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:51,260
there are so many just everywhere also

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:52,910
security so the main innovation in

00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,370
Bitcoin II would say is solving the

00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:58,490
Byzantines general problem which is

00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:01,040
basically like it's easy to transfer

00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:03,799
value on a specialized network but on a

00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:07,240
decentralized network like there could

00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:07,240
be problems of like trouble

00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:20,769
and also you designed it thinking a lot

00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:22,179
of luck in theory things of life you

00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:25,509
made it so that there's no economic

00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:28,120
incentive to disrupt the network and yet

00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:29,860
so it's all done for your life I don't

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,919
want to get like really kind of Tokyo

00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:36,129
business isn't my area of expertise is

00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:40,500
basically built assistance so that yet

00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:43,179
the sub making new points like for

00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:46,299
violating transactions basically get the

00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:48,639
through to the network but you control a

00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:51,639
certain amount of CPU power and he made

00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:56,409
it we kind of reason that that no one

00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:59,019
would ever be able to have like like

00:18:56,409 --> 00:19:04,049
total like no one would be able to have

00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:04,049
more than half the power and they're

00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:11,399
forcing it but basically in brief

00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:13,360
counterfeiting is possible but

00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:14,799
economically it makes the most sense to

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,139
do it as you'd have to spend way more

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:23,139
money to do that and it would be

00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:26,710
beneficial to you so basically don't you

00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:28,269
think if someone wants the target

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,980
counterfeit you gotta find it more

00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:32,019
profitable to play by the rules such

00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:34,600
that favorite thing with the more you

00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:36,850
coins and everyone else in mind and

00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:41,550
undermined the system and

00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:49,540
well so that's I mean to this day like

00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:52,480
like you just don't see and also reading

00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:54,250
his post he had like a pretty good

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:59,590
understanding of like the concept that

00:19:54,250 --> 00:20:01,600
he made it work it's not like a

00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:03,940
traditional money which can be kind of

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,400
like printed on the hand so like in

00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,620
Canada were to go to war we could just

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,400
like drink up a whole bunch of money to

00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:14,590
cover that cost but it would inflate our

00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:17,740
currency you made it you made it as a

00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:21,640
big supply like such as gold but we have

00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:24,010
an absolute certainty on your spot so it

00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:27,220
is only going to be 21 million bitcoins

00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:30,010
everything and then you the new

00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,600
generations of coins or the amount of

00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:36,310
new points generated is always

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,350
decreasing and so the problems he also

00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:40,120
have thought about like kind of problem

00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:42,400
with mutilations are you only have 20

00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:45,120
million points how does that work if you

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,400
want to like have a huge economy while

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:52,120
update point as many probably knows like

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,740
that is about opportunity a subunit so

00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,570
we can just be talking about like tens

00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,919
of

00:20:54,570 --> 00:21:02,450
I got one

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:04,910
and it's also designed well so if you

00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:07,309
look at the schedule look like when it

00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:09,350
Quinn's are gonna be like out of stock

00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:15,559
that's kind of actually happen to the

00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:16,580
year 2140 sorry this is like that they

00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:21,160
don't see that

00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:25,220
but like right now like there's only 20

00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:26,120
generated like every 10 minutes as as

00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,510
time goes by

00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:31,790
it's like house every four years so

00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:35,179
while we're at 25 until you get to

00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:39,010
twelve point five one six and three and

00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:42,470
all the way outside like the year

00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:46,330
21:36 we're going to be like only like

00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:49,160
releasing like other million bitcoins

00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:52,580
and then once again twenty 1 million is

00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:54,830
just going to be no more and so that

00:21:52,580 --> 00:22:01,730
ensures that is kind of rare and that it

00:21:54,830 --> 00:22:03,799
gains value and so just like some

00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:06,799
visualize that bitcoin different kind

00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:10,520
you look that like this like just a pile

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:15,290
of spendable Venus so and you get like a

00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:18,230
hundred ninety million but I guess in

00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:20,520
her she's made one thing

00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:23,340
and it's also very important to remember

00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:27,299
that like actual coins donates this it's

00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:38,850
just the a record of them on the

00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:41,240
portable clock change like that one big

00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,240
pointed

00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:52,559
I think that's kind of complicated but

00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:55,950
yeah so the project started in November

00:22:52,559 --> 00:23:00,149
2008 when he and I was bit to like

00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:04,320
photography mailers and yes I published

00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:06,899
it is white paper at this point the

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,610
software is not released and we can see

00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:12,570
there's a lot of skepticism from what

00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:14,490
everyone is talking to and how any is

00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,710
kind of like a celebrity I think we

00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:20,600
fascinating fortune

00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:22,580
that's what last year so use my magic

00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,980
the leader of this feeling is not quite

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:28,550
sure but come on Commodus right

00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:31,190
atmosphere I noticed like texture

00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:33,230
graphic radius and get cynical when

00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,210
Satoshi announced it going on the

00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:38,000
photography manless about sceptical

00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:40,550
responsive that her partner persistent

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,680
too many branch speed like duelist news

00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:48,260
they tend to get knee-jerk reactions so

00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:53,540
basically everyone was skeptical with

00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:55,400
Satoshi when he first announced Lee he

00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:57,620
didn't get much technical explanation

00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,900
and people were doubting

00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:02,360
oh this isn't secure it's never going to

00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:07,220
have volume I just know it and scale we

00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:10,490
have a certain point but regardless I

00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:12,770
would say that the November 2008 emails

00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,270
were actually important because first

00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,860
the people who responded would

00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:20,240
eventually become like the person to

00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:23,120
lose a Bitcoin and so the project

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,270
launches in 2000 in the early investment

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,920
marina and what's interesting is that in

00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:31,420
the first email of announcing the

00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:35,160
project he makes it clear that early

00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:38,280
adopters would be rewarded coins

00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:41,370
so we always get this term is only 21

00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:43,260
million bitcoins and before I went into

00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:44,970
this project I'm like where is this

00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:48,090
number up front times that we would know

00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:50,910
this is basically Custer Toshi said it

00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:54,030
in his first email and in response

00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:56,580
helped and it's in company beretta

00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:59,430
calculates that if I were to become a

00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,250
dominant currency a value of a single

00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:03,770
point of the attendant he thought it's

00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:06,570
crazy

00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:11,490
yeah dr. evil

00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:13,590
everyone's thinking and yeah there's a

00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:17,630
like a just a sentiment in the Bitcoin

00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:17,630
community that before 0.1

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:24,590
and so yeah Bitcoin even kind of gets

00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:27,330
off to a slow start

00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:29,220
there's many only one others about for

00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:35,070
working with Satoshi from January to

00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:36,960
December 2009 Marky and Elaine this is

00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:39,480
kind of like a spring cabbages but they

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,220
get hub activity so it's just a very

00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,409
small project and then see later on how

00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,760
this is actually kind of situations

00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:52,470
attention to just start it a little

00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:54,929
smaller yeah so one special announcement

00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:57,690
and a 10 million dollar figure you know

00:25:54,929 --> 00:26:00,200
there's a lot of excitement but as time

00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:02,970
went on contribution by others became

00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,530
intermittent but people would say oh you

00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,000
should change this or I want more

00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:10,890
privacy and the neighbors like

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:14,549
disappeared and also I took a point man

00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:17,580
was just barely used but I guess the red

00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:19,620
uniforms providing off their menu for

00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,659
speaking it matters so much but they're

00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,909
worth we both work closely questions on

00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:28,200
the mail was just wasn't getting

00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:29,909
responded to and we there's just the

00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,890
like fact that when the software first

00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:33,929
came out it was important like you

00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:36,690
couldn't do anything with it like we do

00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:39,760
get like onions and ate once but

00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:47,500
and so you just kept these like Pennine

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:53,770
like oh yeah so the only way that they

00:26:47,500 --> 00:27:14,820
would like to come back to the story and

00:26:53,770 --> 00:27:19,030
so and they definitely helped security

00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:20,890
do you think so

00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:23,650
the personally sent Bitcoin was Windows

00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:29,470
only I need to take two developers such

00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:34,480
as another one class later just make

00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:36,640
like or other points or contributions

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,620
that I found helpful where there's a

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,030
vibrant community of people just

00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:43,360
translating the software to other

00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:45,400
languages and also lastly there is

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,770
people helping document the source code

00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,870
and this was particularly important

00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:51,930
because Satoshi's great style and

00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:55,320
development south of spain described as

00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:58,060
unconventional and even sloppy by others

00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:00,160
and the small community works well in

00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,990
the beginning like everyone is well

00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,630
until they tell Satoshi oh we've got

00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:08,320
problems here and they're all trying to

00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:11,040
basically break the the software before

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:15,790
it becomes

00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:18,190
and yes in in the forum posts I rather

00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:20,470
like system she kind of says that the

00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:22,720
forum post worked well command list

00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:26,800
does it help the community help each

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:30,880
other is that I'm always having that was

00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:33,370
the problem and I just kind of like ask

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:37,060
myself the question feels like it's

00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:39,160
actually doing a group or is more of an

00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,720
individual as you can see that we have

00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,420
some problems here that will be

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,180
different you need to help me with

00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:53,620
so my hearing is that an individual but

00:28:46,180 --> 00:29:02,370
so from May to August 2010 is when the

00:28:53,620 --> 00:29:02,370
project really start telling so like

00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,580
there

00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:12,310
so yeah like you can see on the forms

00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,800
that everyone is like really getting

00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:16,690
together and helping promoting the

00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,620
software other places which is actually

00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:24,220
a probably more important but forgotten

00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:26,650
assault so one of the more famous

00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:29,080
project was like the take point faucet

00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:31,300
which was a place great to death 350 or

00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:34,330
first grade good point and this was done

00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:37,300
by an injury student who later become a

00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:40,150
developer happiness association so the

00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,770
site is really simplified like a lot of

00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,870
people would get their first eight

00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:46,990
points from this site and in conjunction

00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:49,920
with other things like that poetry is

00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:54,790
like for the first time completely start

00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:57,550
and stop your bowels and this is just a

00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:58,960
picture that man just space you'll be

00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:03,850
able to comment pretty important later

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:06,280
on i also during the summer 2007

00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:09,490
election the first time bitcoin is used

00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:11,890
as a medium exchange so the one one

00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:14,830
developer glassblower on the boards just

00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:17,230
like i want to trade bitcoins for pizza

00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:19,600
is anyone willing to do this trade and

00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:21,200
so he waits a little bit and eventually

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,440
someone like the

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,900
c'est trés 10,000 bitcoins k1 visa

00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:31,140
that's pretty funny today because that's

00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:32,940
where roughly not quite it's really

00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:35,220
think that's important recap but maybe

00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,190
four million and just yeah a bit like

00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:44,370
the price of Bitcoin just like

00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:47,370
fluctuates the price of that research so

00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:49,560
yeah so in the summer doesn't kind of

00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:52,860
nervous like what I felt like doing sort

00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,660
of marketing like just like people were

00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:58,140
actively plotting on the board to have a

00:30:54,660 --> 00:31:00,240
deaf in front of my figure and so this

00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,940
was like my life so we should try to get

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,770
publish be and focus on being on the

00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,920
right time after the release to get

00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:10,410
maximum impact finally makes me either

00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:13,560
kind of a poor entire food and Facebook

00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:15,540
Google Ads and other places slash about

00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:18,360
this really excellent ingredients would

00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:21,030
be awesome perhaps investment magical so

00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:25,860
right after that post another kind of

00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:29,160
developer and pepper yeah do a write

00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:31,950
after slash dot I wasn't familiar with

00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:34,860
what slash about was or I got in this

00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:37,520
project but apparently and kinda was

00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,520
like a popular

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:49,399
so this actor and you have her like

00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:51,919
right up /tao it kinda got featured on

00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:53,539
flashback and that article is widely

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,960
credited greatly increases the

00:31:53,539 --> 00:32:00,919
popularity at a point shortly afterwards

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:04,220
the price jump in full I guess a lot of

00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:05,929
people would later get involved in 3.7

00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:11,659
is its article that kind of like keep

00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:14,090
their interest and so we got most

00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:16,159
summery and really tell that eight point

00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:19,129
is gaining legitimacy and one of the

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,139
ways I argue this is that the

00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:23,509
establishment of the test network which

00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:25,909
is like a big point before what

00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:28,250
specifically needs for testing is time

00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:30,440
when we see that a point is actually

00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:33,320
like a legitimate thing so Gavin

00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,120
injuries that we lost earlier that's

00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,909
what's up the base point test Network

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,350
and he basically does that because you

00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:41,480
must use them to be able to experiment

00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:44,779
the big point but without breaking

00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,429
though no overall software so this is

00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:50,750
kind of a ground where people can just

00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:53,210
let go a while and start hacking and so

00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:54,380
I would definitely say that because we

00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,990
have a test network

00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:59,210
shows that the real pick point itself

00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:03,260
does have some value and is legitimate

00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:05,540
and a Satoshi and others described that

00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:09,290
disappears doing technic kind of item as

00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:11,360
result getting splash bodies and it

00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:15,140
really was the first real test for

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:17,720
Bitcoin activists after the splash

00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:21,710
guards well there were a lot of problems

00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:23,930
with the surface and some of the like

00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:28,790
crazier things that I kind was like

00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:30,530
there was a there's a error that or

00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:33,380
there's a problem with it coin that

00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:35,870
basically you could generate a pathogen

00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:38,060
or there's a moment ending point where a

00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:40,580
venturi 84 J and Quinn were just

00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:42,740
randomly generated and there's been also

00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:44,750
another like really vulnerable

00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:47,110
security flaw where you can just like

00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:51,470
spend other people's eight points and

00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:54,200
this wasn't exactly a huge problem

00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:56,450
this wasn't exactly speech problem just

00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,180
a community was so fast like fixing it

00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:05,810
but it does show that Bitcoin wasn't

00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:08,360
perfect and also getting in recent

00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:10,310
generation space in practice but we did

00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,629
not we do not know if Bitcoin less

00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:13,359
appearance of it being about the

00:34:11,629 --> 00:34:16,100
community

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:21,850
so the only way you know it's been

00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:29,119
pointing is secure it's kind of money

00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:31,929
and so initially in December 2010

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,590
suppose your basement client just

00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:36,530
explained why

00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:38,929
so the point community is really

00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:43,909
starting to get invested in these like

00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:47,149
political purposes one of the main lines

00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:49,600
those two weeks so one problem quick

00:34:47,149 --> 00:34:53,830
release is that they regularly get their

00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:58,760
fees or the payment processors either

00:34:53,830 --> 00:35:03,220
with her condescending donations so one

00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:05,900
of the a major form practice started by

00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:09,200
Amir taki who would later develop the

00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:12,560
dark point but mm tended to be kind of

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,380
posted as forum post about let's support

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,480
WikiLeaks to think point and this is one

00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:19,850
post like a huge like people weren't

00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:24,320
being with it I kind of like three pages

00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:27,140
of just post but then with 10 or 20

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:30,020
posts or 20 pages in Satoshi comes in

00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:33,290
chimed in and he's actually not happy

00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:35,990
about this because he's worried about to

00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:37,940
make the project to date basically he

00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:39,470
says the project needs to work

00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,690
graduating so that the software can

00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,380
strengthen along the way I make this

00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:45,109
appeal to

00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:48,200
it's not to use Bitcoin not to try these

00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:51,829
papers they putting the small intimacy

00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:54,229
you would stand to gain more than you

00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:57,289
would not stand to get more than pocket

00:35:54,229 --> 00:35:59,599
change and we were would bring would

00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:04,339
like to eat rice on stage so he's really

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:07,269
worried about like such such a massive

00:36:04,339 --> 00:36:09,380
me yeah like coverage on Bitcoin

00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:11,210
especially if it's like supporting

00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:14,079
something as immersive as make movies

00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:19,190
that it would kind of disrupt the system

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:22,970
on and around the same time I'm like an

00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:25,339
article by PC world had the same ideas

00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:27,890
like oh if you make should use Bitcoin

00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:30,259
and its best thing to get out the time

00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:35,569
then there's like the highest Alexa

00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:37,160
mention of take point and I guess her

00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:39,410
she was maybe kind of danger about

00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,450
things he says it would have been my

00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:43,999
skip as potentially any other context

00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:47,749
beginning some picked up or his mess and

00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:49,819
the storm is headed to dust and this is

00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:52,099
commentaries like the second last thing

00:36:49,819 --> 00:36:55,130
or I guess you could never say third

00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:58,539
last image which he ever decided and

00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,539
then kind of just like left

00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:08,510
and that basically we remember said he

00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:12,799
was leaving but he just kind of like

00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:14,450
left and away he gave leadership

00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:16,339
condition two definite increase in was

00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:18,920
like asking you can I put your name on

00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:20,569
this light I was like a contact and then

00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:27,890
when he put his name on just like he

00:37:20,569 --> 00:37:32,990
took his name off but I'm just like the

00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:34,760
others like leaping like having people a

00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:38,450
leader like to be even open-source

00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:45,829
projects in my regular occurrence it's

00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:48,260
not something that you kind of like

00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:50,180
going back like in the summer there were

00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:53,299
questions of like what happiness you

00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:55,400
ever gets for the five of us and kind of

00:37:53,299 --> 00:37:58,130
like more spirits people in open source

00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:00,349
development said like basically don't

00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:04,970
worry about it it's that oh he doesn't

00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:07,039
come and like like make changes to the

00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:09,950
code you can eventually just like take

00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:14,210
the project out of his hands and do the

00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:16,760
you have updates ourselves a lot of

00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:18,740
people in Bitcoin would actually say

00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:24,079
that's a huge departure that was a good

00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:26,640
thing so iron mentioned previously that

00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:29,579
this coding style was seen as

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,890
sloppy and I could have anger and a lot

00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:34,619
of like people working with new employee

00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:39,989
the suspect didn't like such as that

00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:43,230
community and also kinda like having an

00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:45,059
aunt anonymous trader kinda basic to be

00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:48,089
pretty because it seems like there's a

00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:49,680
personal attack during it and once you

00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:51,900
get people like that wouldn't be since a

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,299
strop at conferences we've had like a

00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:57,509
lot more of a friendly place I guess

00:38:54,299 --> 00:39:00,809
just seemed more legitimate and yet that

00:38:57,509 --> 00:39:04,880
migration has Cristina but ideally

00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:04,880
they're friendly and open up

00:39:10,759 --> 00:39:19,049
so yeah basically my main findings is

00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:21,269
Satoshi designer we tend to be in the

00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:24,239
projects less successful without others

00:39:21,269 --> 00:39:27,059
and that summer 2010 is like they're

00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:30,029
critical Percy chemical enjoyment and

00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:32,819
that the departures appreciate in 2010

00:39:30,029 --> 00:39:36,209
as a good thing is that particular

00:39:32,819 --> 00:39:38,339
weights but a quite successful distance

00:39:36,209 --> 00:39:40,829
fashion had a lot more to do and and

00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:43,829
just like codeine and contributions to

00:39:40,829 --> 00:39:46,380
that title box do it but just come

00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:50,039
marketing on the software actually on

00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:53,459
other sites things like that and also I

00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:55,619
kind of interesting that the designers

00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:58,319
point was such that it rewards that are

00:39:55,619 --> 00:40:01,139
the early adopters and this isn't

00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:03,449
necessarily a bad thing but I do find it

00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:05,759
interesting the best of repartee choice

00:40:03,449 --> 00:40:08,689
to just make everyone like a rabid

00:40:05,759 --> 00:40:08,689
supporter at a point

00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,990
yeah

00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:17,250
could you describe this to your

00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:20,110
grandmother

00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:24,900
definitely not like at this stage I

00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:28,030
think everyone's using it could be like

00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:31,450
depends like these remain poised it's

00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:34,150
like not really but no one's like to

00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:36,670
come up with like a secure way I guess I

00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:57,970
mean it is secure but there's also a lot

00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:59,260
of - oh it's getting I'd say it's

00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:02,350
getting easier and if you hear these

00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:05,310
Bitcoin might was the first eight coins

00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:10,270
I thought we're all just like on like a

00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:13,780
basic way it's just like the card

00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:15,610
information advice although Bitcoin and

00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:17,230
there's also just like a bunch of like

00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:19,810
venture capital is trying to make it a

00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:23,580
lot easier to obtain the coins it isn't

00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:23,580
because I don't like circle or

00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:40,210
like mining at this point mining we're

00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:44,320
just incredibly it gets harder to my

00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:46,869
eight point so I need probably like some

00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:49,440
play accents all irreversible like eight

00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:49,440
point mind

00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:01,100
let's guarantee you these people have if

00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:04,290
I own a couple million dollars of

00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:07,790
bitcoins and that can I convert them

00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:14,250
into dollars I go somewhere an example

00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:21,170
so there really is no like if you

00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:24,420
depositor when the other banks like a

00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:34,110
certain amount for you but is no

00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:34,860
guarantee that if it claims where are

00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:38,250
they located

00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:39,690
we don't know his face his face and if I

00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,580
want to send them something a letter

00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:46,200
like people when you talk about banks or

00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:48,860
other institutions or the government the

00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:51,860
government even if they have some

00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,860
coverage

00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:55,079
by things like but I just been dream of

00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:58,769
it we're D like since it's deflationary

00:44:55,079 --> 00:45:03,349
then you're in theory it demands they

00:44:58,769 --> 00:45:03,349
stay both and I am using here

00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:32,210
bye so what I'm thinking is this based

00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:35,880
on budget rather than technical

00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:38,220
weaknesses that they going has company

00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,619
before us today does it come from

00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:50,240
so the next kind of cryptocurrency and

00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:50,240
is basically tomorrow downsides too

00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:05,020
it's technically possible like add more

00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:07,330
zeros so you have to make a bit more

00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:11,200
like there's like quick trillions of

00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:16,060
spendable units and that it's anonymous

00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:19,540
like I think that it's it's okay but but

00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:21,130
creator was anonymous and but these days

00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,960
of blessing on

00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:25,150
you know they're like no but excitements

00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:30,369
and an email question hurt me developer

00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:32,230
and it would like yeah bitcoins like the

00:47:30,369 --> 00:47:36,039
dominance of the normal cryptocurrency

00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:37,869
isn't guaranteed but it definitely me

00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:41,019
that has like the first mover advantage

00:47:37,869 --> 00:47:43,150
in that it was the first one that was

00:47:41,019 --> 00:48:05,410
just about quite Education Network but

00:47:43,150 --> 00:48:07,690
I'd say there's and it's just using it

00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:12,849
as a currency like any other currency

00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:15,430
he was just cooking books on money yes

00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:18,099
if it was strictly he he was doing money

00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:20,200
laundering and things like that but he

00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:23,230
just happened to be Bitcoin he could

00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:25,750
have doing it dollars pesos it was

00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:29,529
really not people took that about

00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:31,740
portion at a context that it was one

00:48:29,529 --> 00:48:31,740
specific

00:48:33,859 --> 00:48:46,939
yeah so there's like especially

00:48:56,869 --> 00:49:04,740
respects so now big point allows Isis

00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:07,680
someone's working here and working once

00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:14,150
at $20 back home it'll cost $30 to send

00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:14,150
out flyers so the cost a fraction of big

00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:35,060
but yeah I would say we still got like

00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:37,190
mountains to climb with that it's not

00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:39,710
like it's going on today and there's

00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:41,300
always the problems like yes to convert

00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:45,070
here it points back with other

00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:45,070
currencies of that much just like

00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:55,070
Bitcoin seems to have a lot they dress

00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:58,040
among people who are familiar with it

00:49:55,070 --> 00:50:00,020
nowadays like things are just like the

00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:02,770
Bitcoin savings and Trust I think it was

00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:06,560
called scam the whole butterfly laughs

00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:09,050
scam the whole thing with silk road

00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:11,660
going down do you ever think that do

00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:14,300
think Bitcoin can eventually reach

00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:16,340
mainstream acceptance or is it really a

00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:22,940
case of it's the Williston place and it

00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:26,060
can't be recalled from I'd say that like

00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:29,930
the well hasn't been poisoned I did see

00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:32,210
like recently hearing on a community and

00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:34,070
there are it seems like the Sun denier

00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:36,500
is dude I don't want to be the ones that

00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:40,180
come in and just watch the innovation so

00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,180
they are looking so it

00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:46,180
we can mix motivation hey there are

00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:49,440
places that are taking it as currency

00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:52,750
you want to buy DNS services or

00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:55,570
registered domain ez e NS will accept

00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:58,420
payments and get Bitcoin so as that

00:50:55,570 --> 00:51:02,440
starts happening more it becomes a real

00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:04,599
of living currency and some governments

00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:09,869
have effectively said in a number ways

00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:35,830
it's legit the US government in sees

00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:44,619
some crime the fact that they are

00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:46,839
selling them the Machine curve when you

00:51:44,619 --> 00:51:50,820
deal with that right so it could be they

00:51:46,839 --> 00:51:50,820
get into the mining business

00:51:56,759 --> 00:52:03,579
counter counterpoint the butterfly Labs

00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:06,880
was a company that was involved in

00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:09,910
Bitcoin mining equipment they have

00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:12,219
essentially been indicted because they

00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:14,259
were hoarding their equipment instead of

00:52:12,219 --> 00:52:18,369
shipping it they were essentially using

00:52:14,259 --> 00:52:19,869
it to mine bitcoins themselves instead

00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:22,359
of giving it away to their car instead

00:52:19,869 --> 00:52:23,619
of giving their consumers the good that

00:52:22,359 --> 00:52:26,229
they had paid for they were using it

00:52:23,619 --> 00:52:27,880
themselves and so it actually is more

00:52:26,229 --> 00:52:28,390
profitable to make it and use it

00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,669
yourself

00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:32,169
than it is to sell it because by the

00:52:30,669 --> 00:52:34,059
time they're giving it to their

00:52:32,169 --> 00:52:35,559
customers it becomes useless because

00:52:34,059 --> 00:52:37,959
they were just scanning a lot of

00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:40,799
customers of money to fund of their

00:52:37,959 --> 00:52:40,799
mining operations

00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:05,040
and he

00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:09,400
and just

00:53:22,109 --> 00:53:25,109
why

00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:37,390
cheaper

00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:32,550
yes it is but surely there's problems

00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:34,710
like concerns about double spending

00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:36,630
which like things like G patch though

00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:38,880
right now what's happening is that

00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:40,890
people aren't minding it coins when

00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:44,070
they're both a few years they're pooling

00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:46,680
up everyone else's computers and this is

00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:49,410
creating scenarios in which certain

00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:54,810
pools are getting really close to the by

00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:56,940
21 percent and Satoshi didn't say but -

00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:59,099
there's still like and not even

00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:01,560
incentive to double spend even if you

00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:04,530
have to do 1% because you're basically

00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:05,760
forfeiting your right so that you can

00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:09,349
generate a take point

00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:12,349
so I thinking 1% act is highly

00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:12,349
discerning

00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:34,710
