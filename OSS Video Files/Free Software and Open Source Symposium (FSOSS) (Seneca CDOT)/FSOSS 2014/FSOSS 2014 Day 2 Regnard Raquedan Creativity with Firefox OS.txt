00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,560
mention i'm bernard and a little bit of

00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:32,130
warning a little bit of warning it is

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:36,060
not your typical open-source talk your

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,130
participation actually is key it's gonna

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,570
be very interactive so if you're not

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,750
comfortable with interacting with other

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,490
people I you know it's all right you

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,799
feel free to just step out of the room I

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,619
would take it against you you're just

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,200
gonna hurt my feelings a bit but no but

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:55,799
it's it's all good it's gonna be a very

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,750
interactive engaging session and finally

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,600
it's okay to react you know positive

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:03,240
negative just meaning you're you're just

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,400
a normal human being so it's okay to

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:09,810
react and I could see somebody stepping

00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:12,000
out already thank you sir okay okay so a

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:15,540
little about myself as mentioned amazon

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,150
rep I'm actually a UX designer by day

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,850
and i have a side project called United

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:24,390
you x which is a multicultural UX design

00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:26,880
and usability startup and I finish the

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,030
improv program at the second city

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,890
training center here in Toronto so now

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,440
you love improv and if you're wondering

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,989
what's that picture doing there that's

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,630
how it looked like in a different

00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:42,070
capacity

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:44,500
before so okay so as i mentioned we're

00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,750
gonna have a very engaging session and

00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:50,530
your participation is key so we're gonna

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:55,300
have a quick icebreaker two minutes tops

00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:57,820
and it's called TMI so the idea is

00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,920
you're gonna talk through ups to a

00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,950
person beside you or behind you and

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,900
reduce yourself and but have a quick

00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:12,580
specific format it's like hi I'm blank

00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:14,920
and my blank has blank so if your first

00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,750
name starts with the letters on the

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,860
first table that's going to be your word

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:23,200
one and if your name is last name starts

00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,840
with the letters on the next table on

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,970
the right it's gonna be your word too so

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,580
in this example you're going to this

00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:33,190
yourself here here to somebody in the

00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:39,850
room and say hi I'm Reynard rocket dad

00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:42,190
and my nostrils have chocolate that's it

00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:44,770
that's the quick icebreaker so if you

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:47,140
could do that introduced to somebody

00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:49,240
behind you just look at the table and

00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,390
this should be fun you know it's two

00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,390
minutes

00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,550
hey

00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,830
and we're off to a good start I can see

00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,600
people smiling already it is good

00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,090
because we're gonna do a lot of

00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:51,700
collaborating later and this is just the

00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:54,390
start awesome everybody okay you get

00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:57,970
introduced so this is a very fun

00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:01,500
icebreaker I tell you everybody always a

00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:03,640
smile so I could say it is a

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,160
foreshadowing for what type of stature

00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:09,640
we're gonna have for the rest of the

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,340
hour so so today's session we will a

00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:15,120
talk quickly about creativity do some

00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:19,030
creativity exercises have new ideas

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,820
hopefully good ones I know what Firefox

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,830
OS is I have phones with me right here

00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,510
and you're gonna play with this I'm

00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,780
going to pass the some phones around so

00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:33,600
you could just know poke poke read

00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:37,720
Firefox OS and the device is a ZT device

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,840
so okay on to our main agenda which is

00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:44,740
creativity so before that let's talk

00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:48,070
some sports specifically home runs and

00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,860
slam dunk so home runs for baseball slam

00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:53,340
dunks for obviously for basketball

00:05:49,860 --> 00:06:00,840
anybody here following the World Series

00:05:53,340 --> 00:06:00,840
okay good hiace uh Royals are giants

00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:09,640
go blue jays okay good so let's stop

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,200
sports so with the home runs it's

00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,730
actually one of the most exciting things

00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,760
that could happen in the in the game of

00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:19,590
baseball but care to guess how much of

00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:26,650
hits are actually home runs in a season

00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:29,700
care to guess sorry ten percent the

00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:33,700
other guesses five percent two percent

00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:37,000
11 percent actually the first guess was

00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:39,640
correct as of last season only ten

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,080
percent of hits in all of baseball were

00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:47,800
home runs only ten percent now for

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,480
basketball it's less slam dunk again

00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,460
what are the most exciting things that

00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,620
could happen in the game it's like a

00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:57,010
short two points it's just your field

00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:59,560
goal it's a it's a can't-miss shot so

00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:01,840
another guess i carrying us how how much

00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:06,700
of shots in the NBA we're actually a

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:09,340
slam dunks I'm sorry seventy-eight

00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:13,440
percent Wow everybody Doug almost

00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:19,450
everybody dancing in VA other guesses 25

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:22,600
50 27 all right you'll be surprised only

00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:28,500
five percent of shots in the NBA are

00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:31,000
actually slam dunks only five percent so

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,210
this is the way I the reason why I bring

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,360
them up is because in creativity home

00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:39,880
runs in slam dunks are not really common

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,590
they're actually hard to come by so

00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,510
whenever you're engaged in some activity

00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:47,620
we're always trying to go for the home

00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:49,540
run for the slam dunk but in reality at

00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,180
least from my experience it's a bit of a

00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:55,270
grind it's like all the smallest things

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:58,170
the interactive process is the small

00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:02,610
things that you do that actually

00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:02,610
contribute and make the magic happen

00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:07,409
so it's not really does slammed oh yes

00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:10,900
you could do the slam dunks in home runs

00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:14,529
but they're just part of your toolbox so

00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:16,389
to speak and as I mentioned it's the

00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:20,559
small things that make the design world

00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:22,210
go around I even probably for linux and

00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:24,879
a lot of open source projects there's

00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:27,339
probably a majority of all the projects

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,789
out there it's not done by just one

00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:32,260
person maybe there's this one guy doing

00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:34,360
some open source product somewhere but

00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,899
the big whoop the big ones the majority

00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,029
they're done by a lot of people it's the

00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:43,479
small things so going back to basketball

00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:46,389
at Kobe Bryant who is very successful an

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:49,480
accomplished player five-time champion

00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:52,540
MVP and only four shots only four

00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,510
percent of his shots were actually slam

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:58,420
dunks it's so small thing is those

00:08:54,510 --> 00:09:01,480
simple shots that he does so success

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:06,639
doesn't rely on the slam dunks and home

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:08,319
runs so maybe I think about this thing

00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:09,519
right now so if it's a small thing so

00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:12,490
how do i do them how do I become

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,459
creative there was research actually

00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:18,639
that said that alcohol is a good way to

00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:20,709
get creative I'm kidding I'm not kidding

00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:23,440
I'm there's research that coffee is good

00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:25,540
for focus alcohols for good for

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,430
creativity but obviously we're not gonna

00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:32,230
have a drinking binge right here and

00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:35,529
although it's that it's a bit tempting

00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:37,660
but obviously I could do it and I have

00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:40,300
to specifically say i'm not encouraging

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:43,560
you to drink to boost your creativity i

00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,560
have to say that on camera

00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:50,470
okay so there are techniques which you

00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:53,140
will do a bit of techniques to be

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:55,690
creative I won't go over them but will

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:58,870
do them later there are some models and

00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:01,510
frameworks where you can you know switch

00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:03,280
things up and mash things up to come up

00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:08,040
with something they're creative so we'll

00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:15,670
do them later don't worry about this and

00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:17,500
actually to give you some sort of clue

00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,810
to what I'm talking about all things

00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,000
right now in the endo in the world there

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:26,590
are just mashups just a substitute

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,040
substitution and aggregation of existing

00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:33,220
products or items like in this case

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:39,390
french fries gravy cheese curds would

00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:44,550
would give you booty what was happened

00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:49,320
who did yes poutine numbers and

00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:59,800
crossword puzzle would give you sudoku

00:10:49,320 --> 00:11:02,530
awesome a Western but set in space Star

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,170
Wars yes that's correct you'll be

00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:08,230
surprised Star Wars actually uh yeah

00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:11,650
sort of like a Western when he called

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:16,270
that spaghetti western said in space is

00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:19,470
actually oh yeah I did everything that

00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,470
third point

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:29,160
westerns based on Japanese movies oh

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,700
okay so that's a derivative of a

00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,899
derivative then it's a good point

00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,120
everything is a derivative a zombie said

00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:37,860
that okay so and then today we're

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,070
actually can do some collaboration to do

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,130
some creative activities so we're going

00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:46,190
to do that so remember those techniques

00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:49,320
we will do that for creativity

00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:51,600
partnerships collaboration provide us a

00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,149
good way to do those small creative

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,519
exercises and throughout the history of

00:11:54,149 --> 00:12:01,880
the creative field and design there's a

00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:07,190
lot of collaborators in and partnerships

00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:12,709
care to name some like creative pairs

00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:18,480
creative groups you look good Packard

00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:22,709
lennon-mccartney what else Simon

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:28,199
Garfunkel key and Peele what Cheech and

00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:31,199
Chong yes so as easy it's it's it's that

00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:35,750
type of partnership is really really

00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:38,550
good for creativity and collaboration oh

00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:47,779
it's just some kids collaborating

00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:51,180
conniving trying to do oh I don't know

00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:53,190
so and with often with these things when

00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,230
you're collaborating with people it's

00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:57,000
often get to start with an open mind in

00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,760
a blank slate so don't be afraid of them

00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,899
which brings us to improv which I

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:07,850
mentioned earlier something i did and

00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:10,140
train train it's a very good way to

00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:13,410
collaborate and there's been research

00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:16,889
that suggests that improv is actually

00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:20,160
good for collaboration and creative work

00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:23,399
in the not just in the creative field

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,139
but also in the workplace so when you

00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,209
say improv you probably think of

00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:30,029
something through funny or something

00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:32,069
hard like the output that you see it's

00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:32,310
funny who here has watched an improv

00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:39,090
show

00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:40,770
before second city yeah so you see the

00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,840
final product the finished product and

00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:46,740
it's all fun and games it's all wow it's

00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:49,260
it's very it's very you think it's

00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:52,350
scripted but it's not it's actually very

00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:54,690
spontaneous people just have been have

00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,940
trained so that they'll know what to do

00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:59,010
in a situation where there's just some

00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,500
guy over here and they're just going to

00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:04,529
react perfectly to whatever that other

00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,810
person is doing it's not actually that

00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:09,870
hard if you break it down into small

00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:15,060
steps in according to tina fey who is

00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:17,760
also a second city uh alumna there are

00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:20,130
four easy rules that you could do to be

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,430
creative which you can apply in any any

00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:29,850
scenario first is always agree and say

00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:32,850
yes second is the ESN you add on to you

00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:35,640
add your own thing to it you build on to

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,800
the previous idea next we make

00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,680
statements don't always ask questions

00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:43,050
and forth don't worry about mistakes

00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,740
only opportunities so we're gonna do

00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:48,540
some part of it today we're not gonna

00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,970
just go here in the improv no we're

00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,710
gonna do something more related to open

00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,750
source don't worry so because I see some

00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:56,550
people like going out Oh improv I'm

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:13,650
quick icebreaker so we have a first

00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:16,920

activity so what you're going to do is

00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,810

and the first person is gonna say

00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:33,660
something generic like hey the sky is

00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:38,819

00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:47,279
enthusiastically just say yes and then

00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:50,999

00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:55,470
times just let's just spend two minutes

00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:58,350
explain why we're going to wear why

00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:00,979
we're doing this so find a partner and

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,389
just the first person's you'll say

00:16:00,979 --> 00:16:08,819
generic statement and the other person

00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:13,879

00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:13,879

you all right yes somebody just said

00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:18,419
like the most enthusiastic yes earlier

00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:20,909
and to you I salute you so that's the

00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:22,350
thing if we have to be for a lot of

00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:25,020
times when you collaborate and talk to

00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:27,710
people are tendencies just to bring that

00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:32,429
wall of resistance up maybe it's because

00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:39,360
we want to we want to be critical or be

00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:40,710
you know comprehensive and you know

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,309
thinking about it in very different

00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:45,929
aspects but sometimes just being

00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:48,419
agreeable and the saying yes is a good

00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:52,190
step to creativity especially if your

00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:56,070
goal is to company and something

00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:59,250
innovative and creative usually having

00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:01,919
to say yes to an idea is the first step

00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,929
and activities like this even though

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,510
we're kind of mocking it even if like a

00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:09,600
generic hey I had the I had a sandwich

00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:13,080
and say yes that affirmation actually

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:16,380
helps you it makes a conversation better

00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:21,390
and it boosts the confidence of whomever

00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:23,220
you're speaking with next would be a fun

00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,530
activity we're going to spend a little

00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:29,850
more time on and it's called mobile

00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:31,740

something people in this room it's good

00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,659

with your partner earlier i'm going to

00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:42,270

going to get a small sheet of paper and

00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:52,920
you're going to come up with an idea for

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,210
a mobile app based on the sheet of paper

00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:58,350

people have food sensitivities and we

00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:55,300
thought okay well if we were to make an

00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,160
application on the phone that you could

00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:00,610
either type in what it is or take a

00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:02,320
picture and we scan it and then against

00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:05,679
some server you might have some

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:08,559
somewhere give your rating in the

perfect sense sausage and some

00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:38,450
interesting ideas see the code with

00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:40,220
awesome ideas here for you to actually

00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:42,200
start doing them we should have a half

00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:44,000
day after perfect complementary event

00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,640
here it's like a hackathon after this

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:55,130
one and just create those apps any other

00:31:46,640 --> 00:32:02,210
finals as sharing okay 22 n broccoli and

00:31:55,130 --> 00:32:05,030
broccoli oh wow I don't okay so first

00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:09,480
why there's broccoli maybe I have this

00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:16,490
app that can calculate the habits and

00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:22,650
maybe the process and the second one is

00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:25,350
ok for 22 I think of the sevales okay

00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:27,510
the last one is the 22 train I don't

00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:30,299
know it's an alpha 2 to check some

00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:42,230
schedule of the next coming trains oh

00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:42,230
okay 2222 broccoli our last names

00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:53,280
thinking of an app that scan common

00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:55,470
items wow it's actually a good idea what

00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,750
dis naman that'll give you a suggestion

00:32:55,470 --> 00:33:02,190
of a good reference wow it's actually

00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:07,470
good thank you 22 and broccoli thank you

00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:08,940
guys wow I'm impressed I'm gonna

00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:10,710
actually started making those sheets of

00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,630
paper it's like now they're God did it

00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:15,330
difficult for anything but seriously

00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:19,770
guys you have really impressed everybody

00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:25,500
here so final sharing before we close I

00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:28,410
move to the next topic alright so wasn't

00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:30,299
that fun based on your reaction and how

00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:34,530
you collaborate other people it was an

00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:36,510
enjoyable activity and it's a good for

00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:38,010
me it's a good intermission to the f

00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:41,760
sauce because we've been talking about

00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:44,309
technology and really high-tech stuff

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,010
that sometimes you it's good to talk

00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:49,140
about and collaborate with people on

00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:52,440
just other topics it's also ready to

00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:56,549
open source which bring us to the actual

00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:59,700
open source part of my talk which is

00:33:56,549 --> 00:34:02,280
Firefox OS so let me just oh sorry i'm

00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:05,429
just going to demo it later so quickly

00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:07,350
firefox OS is the mobile OS at mozilla

00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:12,179
created based off the boot to gecko

00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:14,190
project so Firefox OS is the brand but

00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:16,649
the project open source project is boot

00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:20,340
to gecko so we feel free to just get the

00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:22,140
code of boot to gecko and fork it but

00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:25,680
firefox OS is its own

00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:29,190
 its own brand to it it's an

00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:32,790
operating system metrons HTML CSS and

00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:34,710
JavaScript apps I'll explain the details

00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:39,030
later but think of it that way all apps

00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:40,920
in Firefox OS our web apps and if you're

00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:43,500
wondering how come it ever heard of it

00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:46,710
here in in Canada it's only been

00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:49,290
launched in essentially emerging country

00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:53,280
imaging emerging markets in developing

00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:57,420
countries specifically in some parts of

00:34:53,280 --> 00:35:00,600
Asia Europe and Latin America so may be

00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:03,240
wondering why before I get to the

00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:06,690
details it's because Firefox OS really

00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:09,120
wants to be your replacement or your

00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:11,850
next step from your feature phone and in

00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,590
those markets we really wanted to have a

00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:17,850
very low price point a very affordable

00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:19,350
price point for that smartphone here in

00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:22,950
North America when you say smartphone

00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:25,980
it's it's our carbon iphone 6 or nexus 5

00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:28,770
or whatever Samsung comes up with but in

00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,540
those markets it's it's practically

00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:34,320
unheard of and it's really trying to

00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:36,210
bring down to act the axis for bring

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,870
down the barriers for access to

00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:42,150
smartphone technology for those markets

00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:43,620
so I was talking about some of the high

00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:47,120
level architecture description of

00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:50,190
Firefox OS so you have your the hardware

00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:52,650
components for your phone what which

00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:54,990
interacts with the gonk which is a very

00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:58,530
very small linux kernel it's a very very

00:35:54,990 --> 00:36:01,350
small linux that's runs the runs on the

00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:02,970
phone and there is the gecko engine

00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:05,990
which is the same engine that's running

00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:09,120
on your firefox browser on your desktop

00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:11,220
machines on your laptops and then from

00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:14,160
there there's a the front end layer

00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:17,460
which is the Gaia that's where the CSS

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:21,180
HTML in rendering happens so it's

00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:25,950
essentially that architecture where

00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:29,010
Firefox OS is based from it's it's where

00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:31,650
if you ask me it's in deca where the

00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:33,120
real heavy lifting happens because

00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,500
that's where the rendering of the

00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:39,450
browser of the

00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:42,450
gmail javascript and CSS happens so

00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:44,400
we'll use firefox on your desktop yep

00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,930
obviously you're not using a guy is

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,050
there a name for the part it's

00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:50,820
equivalent to die on your desk hmm i'm

00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:53,100
not familiar but it's just the typical

00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:56,280
browser Chrome there's I don't know if

00:36:53,100 --> 00:37:01,140
there's a specific name for them I know

00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:02,820
its base the firefox I will check but

00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:05,310
the architecture right you have a

00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:08,700
different layer Pablo we're just talking

00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:10,980
that's the main difference yeah well

00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:12,540
actually the browser selfie yeah if

00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,800
you're talking about the actual chrome I

00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,720
don't know if there's specifically for

00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,160
that but the rendering engine of the

00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:21,150
browser is the same is just which is

00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:22,860
gecko so if I'm not familiar with if

00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:25,770
there's a specific name for the one in

00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:33,270
desktop but for for mobile at least for

00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:37,110
firefox OS I'm hit certain sky I am

00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:39,540
firebird yeah cuz it's I don't think so

00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:41,550
it's it's it's different cuz when we

00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:46,230
talk about guy its actual whole OS

00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:48,710
that's Gaia so that's the that's how to

00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,710
describe it

00:37:52,429 --> 00:37:58,079
sorry the witness Louis so the main

00:37:55,410 --> 00:38:00,809
travers donk as well sorry Gaius

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:05,699
represents the your UI for the whole OS

00:38:00,809 --> 00:38:07,349
that's what I meant you are yeah so key

00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:10,349
benefits i mentioned since all were

00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:13,559
based on web apps it's really web based

00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:15,959
on web standards html5 web apps it has a

00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:19,559
very robust privilege and privacy

00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:21,509
management so you know firefox OS has is

00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:25,079
promoting at whole do not track feature

00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:29,189
it's also included in your in yours in

00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:31,739
the mobile OS oops and as I mentioned

00:38:29,189 --> 00:38:35,549
earlier it's really targeted for the

00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:39,209
Affordable entry-level phone on those

00:38:35,549 --> 00:38:44,119
markets this phone i'm going to demo

00:38:39,209 --> 00:38:47,039
today this actually a $35 phone in india

00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:51,119
so i don't know if you can buy a $35

00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:55,439
phone here let me have a phone yes but

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:58,529
but idiots it's this and as i mentioned

00:38:55,439 --> 00:39:01,380
it's easy to develop for it's really

00:38:58,529 --> 00:39:04,229
just HTML CSS and JavaScript they're

00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:08,069
ready tools out there that help help to

00:39:04,229 --> 00:39:12,239
you create apps using those tools and

00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:13,739
that platform so whatever you don't need

00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:15,299
to learn something new you don't need to

00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:18,869
learn a new language if you've been

00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:20,609
creating web apps you can do it you can

00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:24,329
just do it and if you're using existing

00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:30,689
framework open source CMS its kind of it

00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:33,150
can be a web app in Firefox OS so maybe

00:39:30,689 --> 00:39:37,019
you're wondering what that open the

00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:39,269
gates up for stuff like these well

00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:41,119
that's the thing yes because of the

00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:44,099
little battery for entry you can have

00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:47,219
potentially at this type of site or app

00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:50,219
running in your on your phone but so far

00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:52,170
so good like you know what I mean this

00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:56,009
is just my side this is a commentary on

00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:57,900
open source you I in general when you

00:39:56,009 --> 00:40:00,589
say you why for open source I'm sure

00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:04,930
it's not really the top of mine say oh

00:40:00,589 --> 00:40:07,510
yeah UI for open source is interesting

00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:10,450
that's that's and that's really being

00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:12,550
generous right but thing is weird with

00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:17,829
this it just really makes it available

00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:22,540
for everybody and that's why there are a

00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:24,430
lot of references and demo apps that

00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:26,410
Mozilla is coming up with so it would be

00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:28,359
good as a reference for you when you

00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:30,730
make your web app so if you're wondering

00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:33,040
if you're curious this site is actually

00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:37,210
up it's called the world's worst website

00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:39,579
ever and so it was up and as of 2013 so

00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:45,240
I don't know maybe to change it but now

00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:50,079
but for sure this is not 1995 it's 2013

00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:54,309
so it's demo time so anybody here I've

00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:58,780
seen a Firefox OS device before okay

00:40:54,309 --> 00:41:01,569
some so what I'm just gonna do Oh before

00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:05,520
that to show you how that whole web app

00:41:01,569 --> 00:41:05,520
thing works miss

00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:16,640
so I'm just going to go to one of the

00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:18,260
tools here webmaker so I'm actually

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,540
Mozilla has to come up with a lot of

00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:23,390
tool to make easier for you to make

00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:28,220
stuff for mobile so the latest of which

00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:32,630
is app maker so here I'm just do a quick

00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:34,910
demo of this app which is called music

00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:35,960
player it's a web app so just to show

00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:40,280
you it's a web app it's try another

00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:45,430
browser it's just a music app that comes

00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:51,890
up with the beat okay so it's a web app

00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:57,319
now I'm gonna switch over here to the

00:41:51,890 --> 00:42:01,660
phone oops sorry April and this is the

00:41:57,319 --> 00:42:10,579
same this is the same I'm just sorry

00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:14,180
just quit so it's the same app as I see

00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:17,510
here all right so it's running at the

00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:22,160
Firefox browser you can see the URL bar

00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:25,460
over there and I will play it it's

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:30,829
slower it's slower though but you can

00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:33,380
see it's running right and it's this is

00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:36,079
this is produced with HTML CSS and

00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:38,300
JavaScript but through the app maker

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:45,819
platform at Mozilla is provided so what

00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:45,819
I would do is I would

00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:55,280
tap this and see this option I don't

00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:56,930
know it says install this app and then

00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:03,859
there's just going to be a installation

00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:08,089
procedure now we'll install and it's not

00:43:03,859 --> 00:43:11,630
installed this is dog is it gather HTML

00:43:08,089 --> 00:43:16,579
to store it locally or um no it just

00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:18,200
creates a well there there are different

00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:20,150
ways and you under how to go about it

00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:22,310
the one method is what you've mentioned

00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:25,160
they're gonna package it and install

00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:28,670
your machine locally but depending on

00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:30,290
how you set it up but their apps like if

00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:32,300
you're using a CMS for example it's

00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:35,119
gonna keep in a database obviously you

00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:38,450
can't get the whole thing right so I'm

00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:40,339
better scenarios you just have to you

00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:44,570
have to make a call to that database

00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:46,790
that you're connected you're using so it

00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:49,790
just gets some parts of your app and

00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:52,849
puts it on the phone okay so going to

00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:56,720
the menu so if you can see here this

00:43:52,849 --> 00:44:03,079
icon and if it's clear but it says music

00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:07,210
maker see that that icon it's now

00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:11,020
actually a nap and if I run it and

00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:11,020
launch it from the menu

00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,910
let's give it what give it some time

00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,910
it's running

00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:39,619
there you go yes whew so it is now it

00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:43,309
gran is an app you launch to the web app

00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:45,950
on your phone as a nap so that's how you

00:44:43,309 --> 00:44:48,230
do it so there's actually a very simple

00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:50,900
way to do it there's just some lines of

00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:53,390
chol you need to add to your existing

00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:57,710
website which is a manifest which

00:44:53,390 --> 00:45:00,859
describes the app just icons but in the

00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:04,670
OS it's a nap so what I would do for the

00:45:00,859 --> 00:45:06,740
next five minutes or so 10 minutes I'm

00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:08,480
going to pass the phone around and so

00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:13,760
you could play around with this ZTE

00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:17,150
Firefox toys flowing I only have one

00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,680
more minute okay good so uh I'll give

00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:22,130
you guys a minute to move a play around

00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:24,790
with it because I'm practically done so

00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:31,069
it's just really just to show off the

00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:34,640
phone so you know just take a look and

00:45:31,069 --> 00:45:37,010
see how how easy it is to play with and

00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,010
of course specs wise you'll be wondering

00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:43,010
it's it's it's several generations

00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:46,040
behind the current mobile technologies

00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:50,619
now I mean hardware wise but for a lot

00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:54,589
of regions in the world it's good enough

00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:56,930
so given that have a mint left I have to

00:45:54,589 --> 00:45:59,150
finish my talk so I just feel free to

00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:01,339
pass the phone around but in closing

00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:04,130
think about your home runs and slam

00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:07,670
dunks in your own domain maybe you're

00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:10,609
trying too hard for those slam dunks the

00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:12,170
small things also work in progress is a

00:46:10,609 --> 00:46:16,130
good way to find your creative spark

00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:18,740
earlier we did a very an exercise that's

00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:21,220
really improv basically and we mash some

00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:24,290
stuff up and became a very good ideas

00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:27,170
and it was at some a lot of them are

00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:29,210
very impressive and of course Firefox OS

00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:30,770
is changing the mobile OS landscape

00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:34,940
right now maybe not here in North

00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:36,470
America but over the world so next steps
