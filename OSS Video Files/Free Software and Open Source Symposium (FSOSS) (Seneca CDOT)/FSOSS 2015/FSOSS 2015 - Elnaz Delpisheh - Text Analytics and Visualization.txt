so should I start yeah okay hi everyone

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,240
welcome to my presentation my name is

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,150
elmas day Alicia and I'm going to

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:18,000
present text analytics and data

00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:20,490
visualization so so data' basically data

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,420
analytics or data is the oil for the

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:29,250
future well so in during my presentation

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:31,050
i will tell you why that's the oil of

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,489
the future and what are some of the

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:37,230
applications of data analytics and my

00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:42,530
presentation is mostly focused on text

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:49,020
analytics text is sort of data so i will

00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:52,020
focus on texts so well let me talk about

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,539
some really big companies that deal with

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,640
a lot of data like walmart every day you

00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,300
go shopping you make a lot of

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,600
transactions value by perhaps bread milk

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,900
and some other items from walmart and

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:11,520
they have this big data center about

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:14,909
your shopping habits not only yours but

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:19,799
a lot of people around you so what is

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:23,009
this big data center useful for well one

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,259
of the things that this week that this

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,450
amount you can imagine every day a lot

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,880
of people go and buy things from walmart

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,930
so they have a lot of information saved

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,060
up about people in the world so one of

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,060
the really good usages of that

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:43,759
information is basically they know how

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:47,490
to do how to shelf their items in a

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,220
store in a big store for example they

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:53,100
know that people who buy milk tend to

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,380
buy cheese as well so they put them

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,540
close to one another so this is one

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:01,740
application of it so they know how to

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,630
shell items well people and they they

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,110
will also know your shopping habits they

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:11,009
know that okay you are a person who who

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,590
buy a lot of let's say dairy products so

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:16,290
they can based on that day

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:20,160
can send you ads related to dairy

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:23,310
products their promotions or any sort of

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:28,950
related ads so that's very useful just

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:31,440
for advertising purposes so one of the

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:34,590
other aspects that I want to discuss

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,239
it's so my presentation sometimes about

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,700
date analytics and sometimes web data

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,890
visualization so this this one is about

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:45,660
data visualization so canada's

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:47,700
population is around 35 million more

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,640
than 35 million and now we want to know

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,319
how this population is distributed so i

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,480
can tell you okay there is this amount

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:59,670
of data in there is this amount of

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:02,220
people in ontario this amount of people

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:05,819
in other provinces but when you look at

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:08,849
this picture it's really it tells you

00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:12,810
well this one is from 2000 bullets until

00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:17,639
2013 but still ontario contains more a

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:20,940
lot of actually yeah most population so

00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:23,190
this picture is worth basically a

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,350
thousand words so instead of me talking

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,470
about number of people in different

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:30,299
provinces you can just look at it okay

00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:34,489
ontario contains more people so is the

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:38,220
most populated province so that's

00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:41,130
ontario and let's say quebec and also

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:44,099
well bc well there are three most

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:46,019
populated provinces so that's why

00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,910
visualization is more important so then

00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:50,459
i don't have to really discuss this the

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,349
number of people in these provinces so

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,579
you can just look and say okay yeah I

00:03:52,349 --> 00:04:00,750
know how this population is basically

00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:03,480
distributed now this data like in

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,669
walmart that i discuss or population is

00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,799
either numbers or table so it's very

00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:11,669
structured but now i want to discuss

00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:14,700
unstructured data data that basically

00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:19,470
there is no structure in it's like texts

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:21,930
tweets emails insurance claims well data

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:25,500
that contains a lot of text maybe

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,690
pictures maybe numbers and they're in no

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,550
structure like you too

00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:31,880
about something there is no really

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,980
structure on it or other sort of or

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,930
newspaper articles well they have

00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,730
different sort of beta all together in

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,850
one piece of paper so that's

00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:44,300
unstructured data it is really really

00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:47,270
important to be able to analyze

00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,460
unstructured data because firstly ninety

00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:53,180
percent of world's data is on structured

00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:56,650
so and this amount of data is growing

00:04:53,180 --> 00:05:00,890
well with the grow of social media and

00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:04,190
other sources of unstructured data it is

00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:07,340
really important to basically create a

00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:10,520
tool to be able to analyze this amount

00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,890
of information automatically so we need

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,590
to organize search and understand this

00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:19,790
amount of it so one way to do that well

00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:23,420
for example you have this many books so

00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:25,490
in order to understand this data well

00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,490
one way is basically to go through each

00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:30,290
book one by one starting from the person

00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,600
start reading it and then understand it

00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:35,720
and then go to the next one well this is

00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,790
not probably may be feasible for the

00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,010
amount of data that is available and you

00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:42,380
don't have time for it perhaps so we

00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:44,540
need tools to basically do it for us so

00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,180
that they tell us for example in this

00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:51,020
library dislike bookshelves like this

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:53,390
shelf is about these topics and mostly

00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:56,060
for example about psychology mostly

00:05:53,390 --> 00:06:01,490
about like children psychology and so

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:03,320
forth so so this automatic analysis is

00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,270
very important one of the applications

00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,130
I'm going to talk about different

00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:10,430
applications of unstructured data

00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,960
analytics or text analytics is when you

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,860
buy even you want to buy something a

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,720
camera or an item basically so what do

00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,630
you do especially if you're in computer

00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,640
science or software development so you

00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:25,340
you will go on internet and read

00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,650
people's reviews so reviews are

00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:31,550
unstructured data so you will basically

00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:33,260
one if you have a lot of time and well

00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,729
you will go and through all the reviews

00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,099
and read them and understand

00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:39,740
them and then decide but if there's a

00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:42,229
tool to do that for you the tool to tell

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,059
you what reviews are positive about the

00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:46,550
product and what reviews are negative

00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:50,900
about a product that would be awesome so

00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:57,490
these tools are really necessary I'm

00:06:50,900 --> 00:07:01,249
gonna basically well other applications

00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:06,050
that I earlier discuss is social media

00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:08,300
that people well there is a statistics

00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:11,020
that from one out of every seven people

00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,610
on earth are on social media and they

00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,680
tweet or they have their facebook

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,360
profile so they basically they leave

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,939
some information about themselves on the

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,759
internet and the more active you are an

00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:25,610
Internet well people know more about you

00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:29,960
and you get more relevant advertisement

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:33,050
perhaps or well that's so it's very

00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,819
important to have this technique to

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:38,210
basically analyze that well there are a

00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:40,879
lot of companies that they use this

00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:42,949
information for for different things for

00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,689
example to predict they go through

00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:46,909
Twitter and they predict who the next

00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:48,800
who is going to be the next president of

00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:53,509
some countries based on people's

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:56,509
opinions so well I will have one example

00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:58,999
of my slides about it so while talking

00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:03,620
about Twitter one of the really most

00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:05,389
popular social media websites where

00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,159
whenever something is happening around

00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:09,020
the world well people start tweeting

00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:11,509
about it some people are more active in

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,419
Twitter than other people some people

00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:18,199
have more followers than other people so

00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:20,209
it means that those people are a really

00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,430
great influencer so if you have a lot of

00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:24,229
followers so it means that when you post

00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:28,509
something people are going to probably

00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:32,180
accept it or retweet that comment so

00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:34,550
that will be basically distributed

00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:37,180
around the world really faster than a

00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:39,729
person who is not basically an

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:44,060
influencer so if you have more followers

00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:46,699
then you are a big influencer and your

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,800
idea really matters because you can

00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:50,050
influence a lot of

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,000
so that's really important and maybe

00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,769
advertising companies use that

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,810
information in order to advertise their

00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:59,790
products so one of the really

00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:02,800
interesting applications of tweet

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:07,510
analysis was during the Israel and Gaza

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:10,600
a war where there was a well there were

00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:15,089
a lot of Twitter on the world and so

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,089
data scientists decided to basically

00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:24,300
analyze these tweets and see who's a

00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:28,089
well who but what sort of like who is

00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:32,850
basically a pro-israel and who is pro

00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:32,850
Gaza so but well there were a lot of

00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:39,970
basically tweets for example I'm going

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:43,630
to explain what this picture is about

00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:45,880
the ones that are green are basically

00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:49,240
they represent that they are true Gaza

00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,360
and the ones that are below pro-israel

00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,730
and the one that is in the middle is

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:58,180
mostly well neutral kind of thing so

00:09:54,730 --> 00:10:02,560
they don't dare not throw any political

00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:04,000
stream so they are well they are well

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,250
that's that's really interesting because

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,820
you will see that well you will see

00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:13,329
based on the tweets that people those

00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:15,310
influencers publish they can really

00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:18,000
influence a lot of people around the

00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:20,649
world and that's how they can really

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,470
distinguish the news broadcasters from

00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:26,709
one another that's just by analyzing

00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:29,260
their tweets so other tools that will

00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:32,320
help us do that I'm going to explain

00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:34,480
some of them at the end of my talk one

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,290
of the other applications apart from

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,899
twitter is enhancing word search so for

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:43,690
example well you you use google probably

00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:45,640
most of the time and you search an item

00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:48,100
on google let's say text mining so

00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,500
google brings a lot of results for you

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,839
but well how does that Google work how

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:56,050
how do they know that what results are

00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:58,899
more related to your query so your query

00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:01,120
contains many texts keywords so

00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:04,900
basically Google should

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,000
through all the available pages on earth

00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:09,750
and find the ones that are related to

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,779
your query so how do they do that well

00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:15,910
that's that's a that's text analytics or

00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:18,760
data analytics so they analyze that and

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:21,220
they find they analyze that that vast

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,250
amount of data and they pick the ones

00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,600
that are related to your query and

00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:28,930
represent it to you so you will see that

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,300
usually the first four five links are

00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:34,630
related are the most related links to

00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:37,420
your query so that's that's one of the

00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:40,660
applications of text analytics the other

00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:43,089
one that's maybe most of you familiar

00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:46,480
with this series so basically you talk

00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:49,750
to Siri and well that's text that you

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,730
produce and it will analyze so there's

00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:55,060
an algorithm behind it to analyze it and

00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:57,070
then reply to you I know series not

00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,650
maybe interactive enough it's not

00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:01,420
actually interactive it just you it

00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,370
doesn't ask you questions and it doesn't

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,640
really provide answers to you so that's

00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,990
this this field of interactive question

00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,990
answering system is really growing

00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:14,440
because they want to go towards that

00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:17,230
interactive question answering system

00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,330
that is ideal but unfortunately hasn't

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,850
happened yet but they're going towards

00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:24,310
that direction so another one is

00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,440
security for for example your emails

00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,240
when you receive email some of them are

00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,480
good emails from family some of them are

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,940
spams fraud so you want to have a good

00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,339
system in your email to basically detect

00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,050
which email is spam which one is good

00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:42,250
which one is from family and friends and

00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:44,230
so forth so that is done also by data

00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,180
analytics for text analytics so it goes

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:49,140
through that email and it finds

00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:51,850
basically okay these words are perhaps

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:55,810
spam words so they will put it in your

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:57,550
spam folder another application is for

00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:01,779
recommendation systems that I earlier

00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:03,700
discussed well you leave a lot of posts

00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:05,860
on the internet on your weblog on

00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,300
Facebook and based on that you you

00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,220
receive recommendation if you're a

00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,740
person who is into sports you probably

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,649
receive a lot of advertisements related

00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,050
to sports and so forth

00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:19,829
so that is one of the other applications

00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:24,639
so now I want to talk about some of the

00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:26,740
software's that well that are used not

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:30,550
software's let's say some of the

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:33,100
analysis techniques used for those

00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,869
applications and then i will discuss

00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,490
those open source software that are

00:13:34,869 --> 00:13:38,889
available for that what I've done is

00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:42,249
sentiment analysis that's a really

00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:44,230
interesting field and our open source

00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:46,089
tools available for its really simple i

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:49,420
will show you one of them that you just

00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:51,369
put your text there and it tells you if

00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:55,420
your text is positive negative or

00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:57,999
neutral so that's very interesting well

00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:01,240
firstly a sentiment analysis or opinion

00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:03,790
minding it will analyze your text and it

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,279
will tell you if your text is positive

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:08,619
negative or neutral so that's really

00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:12,009
important for example if you have a lot

00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:14,850
of data about people's tweets or

00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:17,709
people's comments about certain

00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:19,689
candidate for credit presidency then you

00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:21,610
will find out okay people are really

00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:23,350
positive about this person or people are

00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,269
negative or people are neutral about it

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,999
so and this is one of the application

00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:30,699
for it another one is a for example if

00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:33,129
you want to pick a vacation and then you

00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:37,089
will read people's reviews on that

00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:39,220
certain location then you will see or a

00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:40,959
certain hotel then you will find okay

00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,720
people's reviews are positive negative

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:47,019
or neutral so that's called sentiment

00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:50,139
analysis so in my presentation I will

00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:51,339
show you a website a very useful open

00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,339
source web site that you can just

00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:58,329
download and use it as a python-based

00:14:53,339 --> 00:15:00,309
website so you can find a text or

00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:05,350
sentence as a positive negative or

00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:09,009
neutral so well I'm gonna explain also

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:13,179
another aspect of text visualization

00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:16,929
using texts from The Globe and Mail well

00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:19,360
I I did I was in the data science group

00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:23,740
in blue and mail for a period of time

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,749
and I i had i did some experiments on

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,990
their date on newspaper and I'm next I'm

00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:28,910
going to show you the result

00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:31,910
of it and also their tools that are used

00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:36,339
so for example given this text just one

00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:39,589
paragraph of newspaper the goal is to

00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:42,020
find the themes of the text the themes

00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:45,140
or topics of the text so the reason that

00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:48,980
that is important is for example they

00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:51,620
want to know they publish perhaps 20 or

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,839
30 or 100 articles today and they want

00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:58,420
to know what is a trending topic of the

00:15:53,839 --> 00:16:01,250
published articles maybe for today's

00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:04,339
well I haven't read the newspaper today

00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:08,060
but let's say if it is about baseball or

00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:12,529
its if it is about other important news

00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:15,290
on well today let's say last week it was

00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:16,580
about election two weeks ago collection

00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,170
and so we're so they want to know the

00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,270
trending topic so they were really

00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:25,790
interested to know what is the topics of

00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:27,770
their basically newspaper articles so

00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:30,200
there are three different techniques

00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:33,680
that I'm going to explain to find the

00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,810
topics first a word frequency then text

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,640
clustering and then topic modeling tell

00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:40,820
me what I is the best of them I will

00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:44,839
explain the basic one which is word

00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:46,850
frequency so they use well not them they

00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:50,000
use topic modeling of course but this is

00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:54,709
just for just I wanted to introduce a

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,110
basic tool to do this basically topic

00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:59,360
representation so there is a no there's

00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:02,420
a tool wardle maybe you have used it so

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,760
you just put your text there and based

00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:09,140
on the frequency of the words in a text

00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:12,140
it will create your dis word cloud so so

00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,809
the more frequent award is that word is

00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,520
going to appear bigger so firstly well

00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:18,800
this is this is but maybe if you look at

00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,839
this piece of text you will say okay

00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:24,020
maybe this text is about education and

00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:27,439
also about young people and tags and

00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:29,510
maybe forth and Toronto so this is like

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,190
it's not very descriptive so you finally

00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:34,460
don't know what this text is about

00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:36,580
exactly is its tax or education or port

00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,080
so it's kind of so this this was for

00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,559
2013 that's why you will see Rob Ford a

00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,879
lot

00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:47,049
so yeah so the text because I was there

00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:50,840
about two years ago that's what so um

00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:53,570
well so this is not very descriptive so

00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,960
work on is good but for like basic works

00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:58,999
but not for real work and also if you

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,330
have a lot of data because you don't

00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:04,490
have one piece of article you probably

00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:07,879
have thousands of articles for

00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:10,700
newspapers or maybe millions of them so

00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:13,659
this word cloud is not good so what

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:16,759
about text clustering so text clustering

00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:19,549
basically clusters the text into

00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:22,129
different categories based on the

00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:24,320
sentences that appear in the text so

00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:26,419
given that sentence so their direct

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,559
their tools to do text clustering that I

00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:29,980
will explain at the end of my

00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:32,450
presentation so using one of the tools

00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:34,909
you will come up with these three

00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:37,220
categories okay one is about tax one is

00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:39,799
about mayor one is about youth okay this

00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:43,159
is good we know that this piece of text

00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:45,919
has three main topics but the problem is

00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:49,549
that some of these sentences appear in

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,809
different a basically categories for

00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:52,639
example there's nothing like an

00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:55,820
education about money while you're still

00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:57,860
young so it can be about money can be

00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:00,710
about youth it can be about education so

00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:04,070
it's kind of not you're not really sure

00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:07,129
what category this sentence belongs to

00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,720
so so that's why I text Khloe is not

00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:12,710
good because sometimes some sentences

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,869
can belong to different categories text

00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:18,740
parsing is not strong enough to cover

00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:22,909
that that's why there's a new approach

00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:25,249
to do that categorization this is that

00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:29,389
is called topic modeling comic modeling

00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:33,470
was emerged in 2004 by people University

00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:36,860
of Princeton day they basically had it's

00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:40,299
a statistics method to find to discover

00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:43,429
hidden topics of text documents well

00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:46,249
they you give them text documents and

00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:48,090
they will tell you what are the topics

00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:51,000
of text documents

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:53,669
and how these topics are basically

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,240
distributed in that document for example

00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:58,950
a book like a programming book could be

00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,830
about programming could be about data

00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:04,049
structure could be about maybe computers

00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:07,500
hardware usually a book has different

00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:10,890
topics so using topic modeling it tells

00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:15,240
you how many for example this book is

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:16,950
50% about programming ten percent about

00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,490
Hardware ten percent about data

00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:21,659
structure so it really tells you

00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:25,350
different like the probability

00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:27,600
distribution of topics so that's that's

00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,880
a very good technique because it we

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,559
cannot say okay this book is only about

00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,929
programming no that's not true usually

00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:37,529
books contain a lot of different topics

00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:40,320
that are covered so that's that's a good

00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:44,880
tool it's the most recent one and people

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:50,520
try to basically improve it using

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:53,510
different methods so I'm gonna well show

00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,529
you some of the results that I

00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:58,380
experimented on The Globe and Mail

00:20:55,529 --> 00:21:02,429
newspaper well they gave me the

00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:06,380
newspaper from 2000 from okay i will

00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:09,120
think from nine two thousand four till

00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:12,720
2013 well i will double check the date

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:15,809
so there were about 140 more than 140

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:20,100
million documents so different newspaper

00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:25,679
articles for the last decade and they

00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:28,350
wanted to analyze it and see what what

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:32,220
we're really well what are the most

00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:35,159
popular topics and also how these topics

00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:39,570
change throughout time the topic trends

00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:42,539
so this is the first result well I'm

00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:44,279
just presenting for popular topics well

00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:46,559
I actually discover that there are like

00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:48,120
100 popular topics but for the sake of

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:52,950
this presentation I just show four of

00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:56,880
them like about tax children education

00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:58,830
and mayor I know under Mayor there is

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,529
like crack word unfortunate

00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:04,080
so basically yeah that was that was

00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:06,779
quite interesting that so for each topic

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:11,190
well each topic as you see is

00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:14,820
represented by words so based on those

00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:18,899
words you can pitch based on these words

00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:21,240
you can pick a good topic label so and

00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:24,960
also I use the word cloud just to show

00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:27,809
different topics of like just for topics

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,769
for top topics of Globe and Mail

00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:33,630
newspaper and also this one this one

00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:37,590
shows that for example document one

00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:40,260
article 1 D 1 means document 1 or

00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:43,409
article 1 like one article there are

00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:46,320
about 140 million articles i'm just

00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:51,630
showing for four articles like the first

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,919
one has like topic 3 this is the

00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,840
distribution of topics for each

00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:58,889
documents like this document one has a

00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,510
lot of topic 3 so topic 3 was education

00:22:58,889 --> 00:23:04,529
so this document is mostly about

00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:07,500
education this document to but this one

00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:11,909
is mostly about topic for which is oh

00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:14,490
sorry topic for is mostly about mayor

00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:16,080
example so basically this this

00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:18,659
distribution is very useful so we know

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:22,649
what like what is how these topics are

00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:24,840
distributed for each article / H

00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:29,039
newspaper article also one really

00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:33,779
interesting thing oh this is dis charges

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:37,440
from 2009 to 2014 so this one shows how

00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:39,659
these topics evolved through time you

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,789
can see that well I use just topic

00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:48,000
modeling for this and I analyze the data

00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:51,269
so like topic tax was well very popular

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,100
here which is around februari and so

00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:55,200
forth so you can see that you can see

00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,880
how topics changed through time and

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,220
that's really interesting because when I

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,820
was working with them some topics really

00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:04,760
faded away very very soon like maybe

00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:07,260
they were popular for one day and not

00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,539
today after that like specially news

00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:11,630
from Middle East we're not very popular

00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:13,790
they would just disappear

00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:15,680
one day but some news about sports they

00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:17,930
were really popular and they stayed on

00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:22,190
top most of the time that was really

00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:24,260
interesting so they can really a lot of

00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,970
advertising companies can use that so if

00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,430
they want advertise their products they

00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:30,830
know that ok these news articles are

00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,660
really popular among people and they

00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:35,660
stay on top they are trending all the

00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:39,050
time so yeah let's do advertising using

00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:40,910
them and also we did another analysis we

00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,980
compared this one with google trends

00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:45,320
because they wanted to know if their

00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:49,040
editors are really doing a great job as

00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:52,880
the google that was just a comparison

00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:54,530
and also what what I I also recommend i

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,710
also designed it recommender system

00:24:54,530 --> 00:25:00,740
porta so basically how it works just

00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:03,500
using text analytics so they publish a

00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:07,430
lot of newspaper articles every day and

00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:09,740
you are the user if you subscribed well

00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:11,720
I just work with subscribed user so if

00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:14,450
you subscribe you've read certain

00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:18,440
articles every day so you are creating

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:20,180
this user profile for yourself so and

00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,250
your information is saved there so we

00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:25,160
know that ok you are interested in news

00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:28,940
about sports and these are the news that

00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:31,910
are published every day so I did just i

00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:34,160
discovered the topics that each user was

00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:37,430
interested in and created that user

00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:40,880
profile for them for example user a it's

00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:44,060
interested in sports and fitness and

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:47,510
health and so forth and and these are

00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:49,250
the news articles that are published so

00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,650
i discovered the topics of these

00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:54,650
articles as well and just it just

00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,820
matching just using those topic models

00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:58,240
so i know the topics that you're

00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:01,310
interested in and the topics that the

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,530
group publishes and based on that i did

00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:07,010
some recommendation so say ok among

00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:09,710
these articles so these three can be

00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:11,870
recommended to you so next time when you

00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:14,870
login so these three articles will be

00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:17,630
recommended to you so that's i did that

00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:19,130
just using a topic modeling just i've

00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:21,080
discovered the topics that the user

00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:24,280
interface interested in created that

00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:27,400
user profile just by analyzing the text

00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:29,590
and topic modeling approaches and the

00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:34,720
topics that glow publishes every day and

00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:37,510
just do diff one matching so and okay

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,390
this was one of the applications of my

00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:41,620
working Globe and Mail and I just want

00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,690
to go through some of the open source

00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:47,320
tools that you can use for text

00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:50,890
analytics this one is mallet so this is

00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,570
a java-based package for statistical

00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:55,180
natural language processing document

00:26:52,570 --> 00:27:08,130
classification clustering and so forth

00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:08,130
they have a website open here okay

00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,330
but i will have to

00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:37,870
so I think I will have to do that okay

00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:51,370
okay so i try to i'm trying to just

00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:53,380
share this video with you okay so it's

00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:56,140
here so basically this is an open source

00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:59,110
so we can download the package and they

00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:02,380
have really nice tutorials that you can

00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:05,590
just go through and just to maybe topic

00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:09,940
modeling so it tells you i use it mostly

00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:11,800
for topic modeling their their tool is

00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:15,430
really good for that so you can just use

00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:17,410
it or maybe improve topic modeling so

00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:20,890
that's mallet so that's the first two

00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:26,320
that i wanted to introduce and the other

00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:29,230
one is MLT k that is a python-based tool

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,930
that you can use it for basically text

00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:35,230
processing tokenization and for

00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:38,020
sentiment analysis let's use that so i'm

00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:46,510
going to actually have the window open

00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:50,680
here so this is n l TK well you can well

00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:53,920
i picked one piece of text from some

00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:56,650
news resources well i have it open here

00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,270
can show you the text well I didn't want

00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:00,580
to read this text I just wanted to know

00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:07,260
if it is positive negative or neutral

00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:11,760
okay this is the text that I used so

00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:14,950
well that's a text so i just copied

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:17,350
pasted so this is a day this website has

00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:19,030
this open has this demo available but

00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:21,220
you can also download it and use it for

00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:24,430
larger amounts of text so this is that

00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:28,330
demo so i pay set the text over here and

00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:32,710
i hit analyze and basically well you can

00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:34,900
see the results here so this ok i just

00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:37,750
analyze again that's fine so it tells

00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:41,350
you if the text is positive but it is

00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:43,210
positive and it tells you ok 0.9 person

00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:47,380
of the texas positive zero point 1

00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:50,590
negative and well so that's that's

00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:54,980
really important especially if you wanna

00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:57,230
basically pick a camera or just go go

00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,910
over people's reviews to know if there

00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:01,730
are positive negative I also analyzed

00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:05,360
some well for one project I did some

00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:08,120
analysis on refugees and there was this

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,650
data set and unfortunately most of the

00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,170
text was negative and I was really

00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:13,430
amazed at how well I didn't want to read

00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,870
the data that because it was so

00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:17,270
depressing with this with this you can

00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:21,500
just see that like well most of the

00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:24,950
texas well- unfortunately and you can

00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:28,610
find the reason for that the reason for

00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:33,230
immigration and so forth okay and the

00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:36,680
other one is basically TM text mining

00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:39,050
package are that one is also available

00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:43,580
to download it's very it's very powerful

00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:46,580
is free is like SPSS but it's free so

00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:48,860
you can use a lot of we can use it for

00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:51,620
different statistics that's you might

00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,820
need in the future for your projects /

00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,980
text analytics and the other one

00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:57,380
rapidminer but these tools that I

00:30:54,980 --> 00:31:00,220
introduced are not only for texts about

00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:02,870
the first one only protects but this one

00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:05,410
this one is not only for text it can be

00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:08,960
used for any sort of data like numbers

00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:11,630
or different kind of data what pictures

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,810
anything so rapid liner is also very

00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:16,250
useful not very fast so they have their

00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:19,450
open source they have their tutorials

00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:23,000
available and you can just follow them

00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:24,710
and the other one is gate for text

00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,620
engineering I'll actually all of them

00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:30,730
open yeah but that's one so you can just

00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:33,140
go through it well I will ask them

00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:35,870
organizers if you want i will post my

00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:39,950
slider so you can pursue click and find

00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:43,060
that links all right so that's what's it

00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:43,060
if you have any questions

00:31:51,009 --> 00:32:00,499
policy ACK on this thing so where does

00:31:56,509 --> 00:32:02,600
that apply on this our privacy yes

00:32:00,499 --> 00:32:05,509
that's a very that's very important

00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:09,259
things especially especially for the

00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:11,840
case of Who am L usually something

00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:14,600
exists and not the views not but

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,899
people's information is encrypted don't

00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:20,210
get it you're doing really that's really

00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:22,809
important they are also encrypted yes

00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:35,629
it's very it's a very important privacy

00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:37,320
is really important issue yes is they

00:32:35,629 --> 00:32:41,490
use an automatic

00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:44,370
you will sorry like are they are they

00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:47,399
society based on software whether it's a

00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:49,080
possible Jenny have it do they have a

00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:51,059
positive well you know how it's like

00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:54,539
it's either a rotten tomato or it's a

00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:56,820
nice red tomato so is the is their

00:32:54,539 --> 00:33:03,120
software that's making reading that that

00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:06,450
critics review in the side or so I don't

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:09,659
come in design but it is it just tells

00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:12,299
you the positive it just tells you the

00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:14,519
sentiment of the texts most likely is

00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:18,029
true key it should be a software because

00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:19,830
I don't think people well most likely it

00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:23,370
is a software to decide it in Texas

00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:26,190
negative or positive but if you want to

00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:28,710
annoy that you should find that baton

00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:31,169
sense of all the people's reviews maybe

00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:33,480
compact their organ some of that some of

00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:36,179
these rims are available online to

00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,519
search for example reviews I know that I

00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:40,500
also reviews for cars that word is

00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:42,779
available and I could just analyze it

00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:46,139
maybe some of them are available for

00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:53,759
movies but but that's that's I most

00:33:46,139 --> 00:33:58,010
likely as me

00:33:53,759 --> 00:34:02,570
it is structured but not believe it

00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:09,380
so we saw Steve Allen like how hard like

00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:11,690
what that's very good question it's for

00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:14,389
example if i told you at experts and

00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:16,190
she's happy maybe I can't decide that

00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:18,889
this sentence is positive based on the

00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:21,290
word happy but there's certain words

00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:24,139
like she's not as happy as she was

00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:25,940
yesterday like this is really is it not

00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:29,419
really positive but it has the word

00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:34,600
happiness so it's this way it is not you

00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:37,490
really find really the hang of it of the

00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:40,250
sentiments of the sentence so they will

00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:42,110
have to do some more complex analysis is

00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:44,960
one and the other wise emotion detection

00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:48,500
that's also very popular to make the

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,720
sentences really happy sad or what what

00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,909
is the emotional for five major emotions

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:57,230
that usually scientist why discover

00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:58,790
that's also really important people

00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:01,730
understand it better because leaves a

00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:04,970
lot of sarcasm a lot of different for

00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:06,590
wishing don't cervix regeneration copy

00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:10,570
really good idea there are really good

00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:10,570
technique software but I think

00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:18,330
can you describe more about this

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:23,060
sentiment analysis technique they are

00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:27,960
exactly words and other any tools like

00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:31,650
we can determine the attitude and how

00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:34,350
accurately so tools for sentiment

00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:37,859
analysis because that's what analysis it

00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:39,960
just tells you if a text is positive

00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:42,150
negative or neutral you know what I

00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,890
would do I would design like I know most

00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:46,170
of these are these are based on that

00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:49,830
they have a sort of repository for

00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:52,320
positive words and negative words so

00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:54,780
they will find that okay in this text

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,510
most of the words in this text comes

00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:01,560
from that positive repository so they

00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:04,080
texted mostly positive but maybe another

00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:06,570
text also the words come from that day

00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,850
of repository words so it's X is

00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:10,650
negative and if it is equal the

00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:13,500
negativity of positivity of this they

00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:14,609
said is sex mutual so this is this one

00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:20,460
of the approaches that they use

00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:23,369
basically some more frequency yeah and

00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:25,920
the second part is like how you neither

00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:28,800
other any tools like which can determine

00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:32,310
the attitude oh of course you would not

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,990
personally thank you a person with

00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:37,440
certain attitude probably you will have

00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:39,660
to pursue a game software information

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,369
so maybe write something that likes are

00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,290
you know and they should they should

00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:46,380
have some input from you maybe from your

00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:49,230
website or blog or your facebook account

00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:51,180
or your tweets yeah based on that well

00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:54,240
they will collect that information and

00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:56,069
they can basically a personal cable

00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,109
using different techniques like NLT

00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:59,760
caper example they can find good

00:36:58,109 --> 00:37:05,700
attitude of this person is positive

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:09,210
negative 2 they are yes yeah and all TK

00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:11,520
yeah but you have to you have to gather

00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:14,160
that information first you have to

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,670
firstly you download to internet offer

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:20,220
them any other piece of bacon swiss just

00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:24,150
find that information it's harder or

00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:26,250
maybe just just create a nap and just

00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:28,440
people who download app maybe leave

00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:32,000
comments for your app or use it or use

00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:34,260
it for texting that they need just some

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,480
information about that size and make an

00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,550
alibi cuz i know that a lot of companies

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,859
do that they just put out there and you

00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:45,210
use it for many rating something and

00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:47,790
then they later they use this data to to

00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:53,520
do some predictions or justice i love

00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:57,680
you or how do you are you really with

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,680
the cognitive computing concept

00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:11,289
platform software from the Jeopardy they

00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:11,289
have more like semantic understanding

00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:20,390
conceptual cognitive yeah I have heard

00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:23,449
about it but I'm not so familiar how bad

00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:26,660
is it sighs do have a website now

00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:28,819
essentially you can assign block oh

00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:30,880
they're done anything with it but i'm

00:38:28,819 --> 00:38:34,380
sure you can submit some of your texts

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:40,410
oh is it is damansara suggested about

00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:40,410
services aluminum oh you type in tonight

00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:51,059
like if you called theory is not

00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:53,519
interacting it's not interactive because

00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:56,999
you just you just sell okay I'm looking

00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:58,139
for it jump like Chinese food it tells

00:38:56,999 --> 00:39:01,709
you can dinner and foods available

00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:03,389
that's it so what I call interacted is

00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:05,069
that you say okay I'm looking for

00:39:03,389 --> 00:39:08,130
Chinese food so they should ask you okay

00:39:05,069 --> 00:39:10,649
what price range are you looking for Oh

00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:12,479
two dollar sign one dollar sign three

00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:14,789
dollars on you and this is this is what

00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:16,799
I call interactive but what city does it

00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:19,679
just goes probably through your google

00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:21,989
Evan your location and then find the

00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,999
nearest restaurants close to you so it

00:39:21,989 --> 00:39:26,609
doesn't really do that interaction I

00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:28,529
don't present for that division up to

00:39:26,609 --> 00:39:31,679
this point not an interactive

00:39:28,529 --> 00:39:38,630
presentation this family don't you I'm

00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:38,630
talking about all this interactive yes

00:39:43,069 --> 00:39:51,119
yeah because I know that they I come

00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:53,999
here with one Japanese at that they they

00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,489
are interactive from the name of that

00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:58,709
but I know that that is in fact what you

00:39:56,489 --> 00:40:01,439
tell them okay I'm hungry and they ask

00:39:58,709 --> 00:40:03,779
you what sort of food you work say one

00:40:01,439 --> 00:40:06,899
works telephone so what is the price

00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:09,329
right this do do morons like what's our

00:40:06,899 --> 00:40:11,849
food of what is the price range like

00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:13,399
this is an interaction that I know well

00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:16,380
it's for serious doesn't really do much

00:40:13,399 --> 00:40:20,279
there are even back in the seventies

00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:22,979
early actually shut interacting a part

00:40:20,279 --> 00:40:25,289
of the cycle psychological where they

00:40:22,979 --> 00:40:27,959
would replay by keywords and have a

00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:32,539
conversation going oftentimes of very it

00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:32,539
was widely testing to see whether they

00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:39,310
boyfriend i think is a very weak

00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:41,320
definition of interactive sure yeah

00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:43,600
maybe i should say maybe speech

00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:46,380
recognition like a speech sort of thing

00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,380
not only text

00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:11,010
well okay i know it i always i was

00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:14,160
looking at there is a conference kdd

00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:16,770
conference knowledge discovery and data

00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:19,110
mining conference that's a peasant top

00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:21,630
conference in data mining data analytics

00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:24,150
if you follow that conference there they

00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:26,490
have some really nice video lectures one

00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:28,050
of them was our knowledge graphs i think

00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:29,670
that's that's gonna be a future where

00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:32,450
all the pieces of information on

00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:37,740
connected to one another 3d graph and

00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:39,600
then just then searching for permissions

00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:45,570
just threw that huge graphite in

00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:48,000
knowledge k DD yeah knowledge discovery

00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:49,920
and maybe I'll well that's that's really

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,200
related to be ethical compass for

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:56,840
daytime so they have really nice to do

00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,840
lectures I think that's

00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:04,670
are you aware of any application in the

00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,670
education sector

00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,130
written

00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:43,390
sentences for diversity and handling but

00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:48,010
it's like a lesson in vice complex

00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:48,010
Vikings have no larger

00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,200
