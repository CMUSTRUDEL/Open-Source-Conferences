oh and i'm here to introduce our

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:17,090
presenter this afternoon and yep Oh our

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:20,850
presenter this afternoon is making and

00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:24,150
our topic is and they are the printer

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,939
using our to visualize the stories of

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,630
Canadian organizations that continues to

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:33,690
five development maybe the kids disc

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,899
candidate is authentic management or

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:39,450
pencil strategies are especially at this

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:42,300
a shriek school of business yogi bhajan

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:45,180
his recite focuses on bringing

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,879
contemporary management fury with open

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,399
source of research in practice his

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:54,300
teaching focuses on strategy the morning

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,340
enterprise with open stance with open

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,430
those strategies and then increasingly

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,340
recognized approach involves an

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,589
undergraduate at a gradual decrease from

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,650
Carleton University of pure systems

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,689
engineering psychology and a master's

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,060
degree in technology innovation

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:15,180
management he is a licensed professional

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:19,350
engineer in the province of Ontario

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,570
maybe is the founder of OS strategy

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,640
that's always a strategic management

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,040
consulting on that helps companies

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,950
improve their business models and

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:34,350
strategic planning the world that is

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:36,930
embracing FM OS tools and methods so I

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:41,549
have the pleasure to in present to you a

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:44,280
scholar a researcher interviewer as

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:48,960
petitioner make it but thank you my

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:52,170
friend I promised maxima submit a

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,170
smaller profile sorry about that if you

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,659
want to follow along these slides I gave

00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,790
a preliminary presentation on this stuff

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,170
last year at F sauce and if you look at

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,380
the bottom of the slide there those

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:08,310
slides are available at OS strategy org

00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:10,709
/f sauce 2014 or the current 1 2015 in

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,050
your choice of formats the content of

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:14,190
all these slides are licensed as CC by

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,260
so feel free to do whatever you like

00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:21,330
with them you can find me on twitter at

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:23,310
mackay and my website Mackay CA because

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,220
I talk way too fast and let's have

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:30,990
better conversations later on that

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:33,390
aren't in this format so this is part 2

00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,910
of my doctoral research I was originally

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:39,060
motivated by the frustrations many

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:41,520
engineers faced with management people

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,470
telling us open sources in a viable

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,910
business model that's ridiculous we need

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,040
to close everything down or we can't

00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,600
make any money and I said that's stupid

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,730
so I'm going to go do a PhD and prove

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,120
you're wrong and the way I'm doing that

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:56,700
right now is I'm analyzing Mozilla's

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,960
bugzilla database and trying to find

00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,960
some interesting insights about how we

00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:04,500
can understand organizational level

00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,200
participation in open source so some of

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,600
the findings are coming out of that

00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:12,060
right now are on the Canadian side of

00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,970
things and then stay tuned for next year

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,040
we're all do a global take on that and

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,320
some interesting stuff there so to do

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,870
this research I use our our is a common

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,330
a statistical analysis tool that shows

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,810
up at universities everywhere that's

00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,130
displacing the really expensive

00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,840
statistical analysis packages which is

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,610
hilarious of course you know research on

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,650
open source has to be done with an open

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,209
source statistical tool so along the way

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,250
you'll note that absolutely everything

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:42,860
in this presentation was created in our

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:45,420
and the code that is used to generate

00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:48,480
everything in this presentation I posted

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:51,470
on github and its licenses GPL 3 so you

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:55,560
can find me on github under username

00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:58,680
meki m and you are welcome to take this

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,290
code not embarrass me for how terribly

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,209
written it is and fork it and improve it

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,730
and do all those wonderful things very

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:08,430
soon there will be a new branch that has

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:13,110
the wider analysis beyond canada showing

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:15,630
up in this github analysis location and

00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:17,580
i'd love to participate with you to work

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,830
with you to get some more interesting

00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:22,500
insights at a bugzilla that's how we got

00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:24,600
here first I'm acknowledgments lots of

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,830
people have supported this research York

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,400
University Schulich School of Business

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,290
on

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,270
ministry of training colleges and

00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,860
universities with their grants of course

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,919
Thank You Mozilla for giving me access

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:38,759
to your bugzilla database in raw form a

00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:40,889
huge 8 gigabyte CSV dump essentially

00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,710
it's delightful the analysis you can do

00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:45,120
with that and find lastly and I want to

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,979
thank Syrah the Canadian internet

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,840
Registration Authority and their

00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:50,910
community investment program they gave

00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,740
me a sizable grant for this portion for

00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,600
the research so thank you very much for

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,210
that and in particular like this thang

00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,880
Jenna Feldman who's the manager of

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,860
community relations at syrah who did a

00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,570
wonderful job of supporting many

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,460
open-source projects they've been

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,770
supporting mozilla as well some other

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,350
projects so thank you to Sarah much

00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:12,840
appreciated incidentally they're taking

00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,889
applications for next year's grants if

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,620
you're interested look into the

00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:18,330
community investment program grants so

00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,210
what's going on with our I've mentioned

00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:24,090
some of it it's been slowly displacing

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,880
other statistical packages since about

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:29,419
two thousand and now it's pretty excuse

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,650
me pretty much the de facto standard for

00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:33,750
analysis so it's a great example of an

00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,780
open source community that is exploded

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:40,169
it's largely developed by and maintained

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:42,630
by academics who wanted control that

00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:44,970
didn't involve having to go to SPSS or

00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,190
SAS and say hey can you please add this

00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,260
feature every time a new statistical

00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,880
process was developed and you wouldn't

00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,650
think they're been in advances in

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,240
statistics over the past 30 years but

00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,620
that's completely untrue in fact there

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,039
have been huge advances and they're

00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,960
continuing so it allows them to create

00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:02,909
better statistical analysis tools faster

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,979
than the commercial off-the-shelf model

00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:07,500
and you know it being free it makes it

00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:09,030
really easy because universities are

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,159
notoriously bad for their procurement

00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,260
departments just like government so a

00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:15,510
lot less headache for academics you want

00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,760
to do analysis so you can poke around on

00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:19,289
see ran the comprehensive our archive

00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,389
network and see what's going on there

00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:23,909
there are literally thousands of add-on

00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:25,740
packages to do pretty much anything you

00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:28,320
would like and if you look in the

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,690
comments of my code I list all the

00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:34,260
packages that I use for this particular

00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:36,270
analysis but you could you know as Larry

00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,909
wall likes to say Tim toady you can do

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,620
it many different ways there are lots of

00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:41,720
redundant

00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,190
packages and that's deliberate so that

00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,139
you can choose the approach that you're

00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,669
most comfortable with so you see the

00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:49,010
graph on the right there that are has

00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:51,320
just exploded in popularity and all

00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:53,060
these statistical software vendors are

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,370
freaking out and trying to figure out

00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:59,540
how to do open source business models so

00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:01,340
yay ? the github repository i mentioned

00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,720
everything's licenses GPL three and

00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,880
there are extensive comments

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,979
particularly because my code is so

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,770
terrible so i compensate for that by

00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:10,850
having extensive extensive comments so

00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,410
you should be able to figure out what's

00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,880
going on just from reading my comments

00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,949
and then you can laugh at how poorly

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,669
it's done and you can approve it so

00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:21,289
expect future branches at that location

00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:22,610
why am I looking at Canada the obvious

00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:24,650
reason is because it fits with the

00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,860
Sierra mandate but the less obvious

00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:31,400
reason is that we lost Silicon Valley

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:33,229
North after the 2001 crash and nortel

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,419
fell apart and everything in Ottawa and

00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:37,850
you know what what'm is not looking so

00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:40,160
healthy these days with rim either so

00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,720
there's sort of a desire in Canada

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,120
figure out what's really going on in

00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,310
terms of Internet innovation there's a

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,039
belief that the Internet economy will

00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,289
contribute a huge amount in the canadian

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,419
gdp over the next few years but nobody

00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:55,070
really knows how or why so that's why

00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:57,169
i'm looking at canada with this research

00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,789
because it's particularly relevant to a

00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:01,370
lot of the funding agencies and

00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:03,740
innovation policy in canada and of

00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,450
course educational institutions why look

00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,220
at Firefox I don't really need to

00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:09,440
explain that to this audience everybody

00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,900
knows why is because it's awesome it

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,520
beat Microsoft at the game trying to

00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,250
take over the internet back in the early

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,990
days but now it's kind of waning Firefox

00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,090
uses share is waning and that's a little

00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,460
bit panicky for those of us who care

00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:24,139
about the open web so understanding why

00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,360
and how that's happening and how we can

00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:28,340
get organizations who have money to help

00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,360
turn that around I think is really

00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:34,520
important plus you know Toronto big

00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,020
office lots of people like beer you know

00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,390
that personal connection is worth a lot

00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,159
beer is such a currency and open source

00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,500
let me tell you it's not just a linux

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,240
kernel joke by people beers you'd be

00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,980
amazed at what you come up with so

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,920
access to the database was a really good

00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:52,130
reason to so let's jump in graph number

00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,760
one today what is bugzilla look like on

00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,790
the Canadian

00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,110
perspective so this is a hastily drawn

00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,030
and probably difficult to visualize

00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:01,330
maybe you can see it on your own laptops

00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:04,910
a little bit better of all the different

00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:07,190
organizations who contribute to bugzilla

00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:10,010
in canada so how did i come up with that

00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:11,540
there's a field in bugzilla which

00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,340
incidentally i should mention if

00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,410
everybody wants to take this on bugzilla

00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,120
doesn't have a proper schema that's up

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,100
to date so trying to figure out what

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,160
fields do what Joshua pointed out

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,200
earlier is not exactly trivial so

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,210
there's a field called login name in the

00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,860
profiles table which is essentially an

00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:30,410
email address and through some

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,120
interesting code I was able to split up

00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,340
the portions of the email address and

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,010
aggregate them around all the ones that

00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:39,410
end in dot CA so that actually creates a

00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,540
very conservative subset of the people

00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,740
who are involved in Canada obviously

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,940
lots of people in Canada are

00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,040
contributing with gmail and hotmail

00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,540
addresses but there's no way for me to

00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,120
identify them because that data is

00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:52,160
simply not in the database but with this

00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,260
conservative sample I was still able to

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,000
find really really cool things so it's

00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,650
worth looking at that so that's how he

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,440
came up with this list I identified

00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:03,500
approximately 6,000 different

00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,140
organizational users that in this small

00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,750
subset contributed from dot CA from a

00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:11,830
Canadian context and I was in neighbor

00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:15,290
able to reduce that to approximately

00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:17,840
1,400 organizations involved in Canada

00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:22,100
there some magic I had to do to

00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:24,230
eliminate all the webmail hotmail Gmail

00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:27,350
that kind of stuff addresses that had

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:29,600
dot C extensions Rogers ISP emails and

00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,310
all that stuff it's really ugly it's

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,320
even uglier in the next branch that's

00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:35,240
going to come up but it works and so we

00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,120
have a very very conservative subset

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,250
that we can be sure as much as we can is

00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,290
Canadian and Canadian organizations

00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,060
although obviously there's a lot more so

00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:46,280
this is what it looks like and no

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,810
surprise it's it's not even at all

00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,130
different organizations contribute

00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:52,250
different amounts so this is the count

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:55,490
of number of registered users with that

00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,620
particular dot CA domain portion once

00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,390
you strip off everything ahead of that

00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,250
in front of the @ symbol and in front of

00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,900
subdomains and all that this is what it

00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,630
looks like so in the top left we see

00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,499
University of Toronto and a bunch of

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,029
other people there

00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:10,069
and then you see a tapers off into a

00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:12,109
really really really long tail so

00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:14,629
suddenly we have a visual of the long

00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:16,189
tail effect in bugzilla in canada that's

00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:17,659
pretty cool I don't know about you guys

00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:18,919
that I've never seen that before and

00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:21,079
that really excited me when I first

00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:23,149
generated this graph and like yes we can

00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:26,299
see the long tail effect of open-source

00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:28,249
contribution in Canada that's cool so

00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:32,149
then I want to mess around with that so

00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:34,549
our has internal graphing language that

00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,409
is essentially its own sub language

00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:38,959
inside of our it's a library called

00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:41,059
ggplot2 which is an absolutely terrible

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,429
name for a graphing library but it's

00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:46,969
extremely powerful and allows you to

00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:48,679
manipulate data tables multi-dimensional

00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:50,659
data tables and all kinds of interesting

00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:53,209
ways to generate these graphs so all of

00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:55,339
these graphs are generated from the same

00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:58,129
data but using different intersections

00:11:55,339 --> 00:12:00,859
of tables different ways of representing

00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:02,899
the data adding variables like time or

00:12:00,859 --> 00:12:04,519
various forms of aggregation and so on

00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:06,739
and that's part of the power of the

00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,239
graphing language in our if you dig

00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:11,029
through the source code you can see what

00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:12,259
that looks like and my comments explains

00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:14,269
sort of what's going on because my

00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:16,009
comments were me learning how to do it

00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:17,359
as as I was going so some of the

00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:19,309
comments are really done because I'm

00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:21,259
excited about this little thing that a

00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:23,179
regular our user would be like that's

00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:24,829
obvious you know but if you're starting

00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:27,739
up it'll be helpful to read my comments

00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:29,749
so here I split them into groups and we

00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:33,309
have on the Left we have universities

00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:35,899
and then the green we have colleges the

00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:38,299
marine aquamarine whatever that is we

00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:40,489
have federal government and then the

00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:42,019
purple is other that's the long tail

00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:43,189
that gives us a little bit of

00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:44,839
information about how they're

00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:47,119
distributed but it doesn't tell us a

00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:50,389
whole lot so let's try a different view

00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:52,609
let's use the facilities in our to split

00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:55,279
up the individual lines within those

00:12:52,609 --> 00:12:57,589
graphs and overlay the means of those

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,779
sources it looks really ugly when

00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:05,359
there's 1400 organizations in here but

00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:07,789
you can already see some contrast to to

00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:10,219
those columns so clearly the right hand

00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:12,589
column is the long tail it's not really

00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:16,189
one organization doing a lot except

00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:17,279
maybe that big blue and off red blob in

00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:19,350
the middle there

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,720
we can see what better what's going on

00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,249
but the scale is terrible it's really

00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,399
hard to see so let's adjust the scale

00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:28,350
and knock off all that long tail that's

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,300
the other let's see what's going on with

00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,430
universities colleges and federal

00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:36,120
government we see that the universities

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:38,490
are dominated by a few larger number of

00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,009
users in the universities in the green

00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:45,120
at the bottom there we see in colleges a

00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:47,309
giant purple square there that

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,199
represents the college that is making

00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:52,259
the most contributions in Canada you

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,990
want to take a guess who wants to take a

00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:57,959
guess about what color purple is it's in

00:13:54,990 --> 00:14:00,749
the legend if you can squint Seneca

00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:02,550
College no surprise there Seneca College

00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:04,170
is in fact eclipsing all the other

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,720
colleges and we can suddenly see that a

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:09,209
nice big purple square that compares it

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,529
to the other users in bugzilla and then

00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:12,209
we see something going on in a few

00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:13,920
federal government departments in there

00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:17,189
but we're still not seeing a lot so

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,749
let's let's let's try to understand a

00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,699
little bit more before we generate the

00:14:18,749 --> 00:14:21,959
next graphs so I talked to a lot of

00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:23,490
people I talked to people at

00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:25,350
universities I talked to people at

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,720
colleges I talked to people at Mozilla

00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,459
and in open-source organizations and I

00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,930
interviewed them and I transcribed their

00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:33,329
interviews and I did all kinds of

00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:36,600
academic key stuff and what I learned is

00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:39,149
that universities are not all the same

00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,980
you have these top-tier universities who

00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:44,009
have a reputation effect over a hundred

00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,959
years and for them open source is sort

00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:47,699
of like yeah yeah academic freedom this

00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,709
is cool we're going to do this thing we

00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:51,360
have tenure you know what let's do this

00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:54,389
and then you have the smaller

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,740
universities who are sent you like ah we

00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:57,750
got to catch up to the big universities

00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,459
so let's only do the things that count

00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:02,250
towards the metrics to give us better

00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:04,170
rankings open source nah nobody measures

00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,149
that for university rankings why would

00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,800
you do that so what you actually see in

00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:10,079
the smaller university is is a few

00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,120
professors on the side who are doing

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,529
sort of skunk word projects because they

00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,160
understand that this is important

00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:18,029
research but that it's not really a

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,589
strategy of those universities because

00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:21,240
it doesn't contribute to the metrics and

00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:22,860
what makes them great universities they

00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,500
don't want to be you if she and Waterloo

00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:28,050
right so incidentally York fits that

00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,330
pattern I'm not bitter at all clearly

00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,410
so we're understanding a little bit more

00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,779
about what's going on inside of

00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,550
universities that tells us something so

00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:37,560
let's look more closely just at the

00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,600
universities so on the left side of the

00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,269
graph there you see university of

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,269
waterloo you see university of toronto

00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:47,190
you see you bc a simon fraser university

00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:49,320
seem to have the most users and then it

00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:51,480
tapers off gradually for the rest

00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,040
canadian universities you'll also note

00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,820
that we've added on the right side there

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,680
a and index to see what's going on and

00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,320
the graphing language allows you to play

00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,279
around with that a lot you can use

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,899
auto-generated colors you can play

00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:05,550
around the colors you can put indexes

00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:07,470
not indexes it pulls out all

00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:09,269
automatically out of your data sets you

00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,459
don't to manually write this there is no

00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:13,529
post-processing in this graph this is

00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:14,940
directly what comes out of our we're

00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:16,620
just kind of cool because otherwise you

00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,810
have to manipulate it and you have to do

00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,600
stuff afterwards and it makes it easier

00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:23,250
to visualize data quickly but users

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,410
that's only one way to count

00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,240
contributions right i mean you can have

00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,700
a lot of users who aren't doing much so

00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,680
let's add in a time variable and let's

00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:34,110
see what they're doing in terms of bug

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,450
reports suddenly the picture looks very

00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:38,820
different we see mcgill who doesn't show

00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:40,950
up with a lot of users actually being

00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,480
the first to be really involved in

00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:45,060
concert and contributing and they were

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,950
contributing as early as 2002 so this

00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:50,060
data set starts from the beginning

00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:53,550
beginning a muzzle in 1998 to the end of

00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:56,520
2012 so I don't have any data after the

00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:58,560
end of 2012 but we do have a 14 year

00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,270
window there which is pretty cool so we

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,430
see mcgill was involved really really

00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,410
early on and then they dropped off the

00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:06,780
face of the earth they stopped doing it

00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,699
so you got again an interesting question

00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,709
there but what was mcgill getting out of

00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,780
it in 2002 that they're not getting out

00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:14,850
of it in 2015 so when we're talking

00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:17,510
about ways of onboarding people to

00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:21,360
contribute to projects understanding the

00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:23,220
organizational level motivations are

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,050
suddenly really important especially

00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,329
when someone in mentioned in the last

00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,740
presentation how much universities and

00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:30,929
colleges are contributing to open source

00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,400
projects so why isn't mcgill involved

00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:33,630
anymore i think that's a really

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,940
interesting question and this

00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:37,530
visualization tells us exactly the time

00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,419
frame in which that happened did a

00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,950
professor move to another university and

00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:42,390
nobody followed up or what's going on

00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,130
there that's pretty cool

00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,480
we also see that the University of

00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:48,180
Toronto started getting really involved

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,610
around 2004 I'm in a tapered off a lot

00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:53,250
and then Waterloo shockingly you

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:56,310
wouldn't think this only really sort of

00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,960
starts to spike around 2011 you would

00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:00,450
think Waterloo would have had really big

00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,310
early involvement and so maybe an

00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,170
interesting question is who's at Mozilla

00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,640
right now who was previously at

00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,470
University of Waterloo and might have

00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,140
done stuff when they were there that

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,610
that's an interesting question so we see

00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:15,060
these various different patterns over

00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:17,460
time than we can identify and get a

00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,930
better sense so again bug reports it's

00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,610
only one measure what about activities

00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:23,850
activities are kind of different

00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:25,680
activities is assigning and changing

00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,360
statuses and prioritizing a lot of the

00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,730
things that Josh was talking about in

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,040
his presentation who's doing the most

00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:33,660
activities turns out that the University

00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,670
of Toronto does a lot of that so maybe

00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,500
they're a bit of a gatekeeper for some

00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:39,810
Mozilla communities because they do a

00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,830
lot of the activities moving around even

00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:43,890
though maybe they don't necessarily

00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:45,990
submit the most bugs that's interesting

00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:48,240
why why University of Toronto why no one

00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,010
else good question so that's something

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,780
to look into and again we see you know

00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:55,410
sir Waterloo doing a bit more of that in

00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:57,120
2011 but it's the skew is very different

00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,770
here in terms of activities so that

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,210
gives us a sense of what they're getting

00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:04,830
out of their participation why they're

00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:06,180
doing it what about colleges well we

00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,970
know Senecas involved but how does that

00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:11,250
compare to universities what we see in

00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,140
the past 20 years in Canada is that the

00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,850
colleges are playing a bit of a sort of

00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,590
a catch-up game the past 10 years

00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:18,960
government funding has actually

00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:20,430
drastically increased for colleges the

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,830
Harper government really wanted to

00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:27,390
improve funding to trades and that kind

00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:29,880
of sort of not pie in the sky view of

00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:32,280
education which politicians tend to

00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,660
think is university it's not necessarily

00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,940
true but that's what the political

00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,130
environment was and so we see colleges

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,320
who are now in a position to close the

00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,240
gap with universities there now allowed

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,640
to introduce bachelors programs they're

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,230
allowed to hire people who have PhDs and

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,820
offer their own bachelor's in some cases

00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:49,560
or sometimes in partnerships with

00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,210
universities they're getting much more

00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,220
funding and sometimes they're turning

00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:55,420
into universities so not too long ago

00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:58,360
Ryerson was a college then if

00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,760
kami University so there's incentive

00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,040
both nationally and internationally for

00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,170
the college's to play catch up to the

00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:09,100
universities and to do that they have to

00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:12,070
absolutely coin themselves in a unique

00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,960
area and it's no surprise that Seneca

00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,630
has coined around open source we know

00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:19,450
that right up to David add news level

00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:21,400
the president open source and technology

00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:23,590
and those areas have been a focus of

00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,120
Seneca what are the other colleges doing

00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:27,370
well we don't see that in the bugzilla

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,050
database because it's not open source

00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:32,280
but for example if you ask around

00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:37,650
Sheridan's focusing more on 3d animation

00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:40,900
loyalist is focusing more on things like

00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:43,330
security infrastructure that kind of

00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,430
stuff out west the colleges are focusing

00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,670
more and mining that kind of specialty

00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:50,680
and so you get the different sort of

00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:53,170
colleges with their brands and how

00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,030
they're they're involved there so again

00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:57,550
son cows a lot of users are they doing a

00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:00,490
lot of bug reports over time absolutely

00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:03,910
they started doing it massively around

00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,500
2003 we should see when David Humphries

00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:08,020
first started at Seneca that might be an

00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,370
interesting and measure as well and we

00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,380
see that they maintained it threw out

00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:13,270
some other colleges came and went and

00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,790
were involved but by and large Seneca is

00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:17,770
eclipsing everything for activities as

00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:20,740
well we see a huge bump in activities

00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:25,900
around 2008 what happened in 2008 with

00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:30,280
Mozilla and Seneca anybody know Chris no

00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:32,950
pressure but it's it's the cedaw ramped

00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:35,010
up largely it's not all 2008 but you can

00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,150
actually see in bugzilla the

00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:39,010
formalization of cidade and ramping it

00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:41,410
up and getting more funding and so on

00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:42,940
and so forth it wasn't just in 2008 but

00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:45,850
that's when it really became a bit of an

00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,710
explosion and we see it's continued over

00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:49,450
time before that it was around but it

00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:52,180
wasn't sort of the focus you didn't have

00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:54,310
these courses I think David first

00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:57,700
offered his muzzle a course in 2008 is

00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:59,920
that right around that time in that

00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,140
ballpark certainly so we see that surge

00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,720
in the muzzle of database and we see the

00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,160
other colleges aren't doing very much

00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,630
okay so Seneca is awesome we know that

00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,720
but what about compared to universe

00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:12,310
how did they scale well turns out seneca

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,470
is actually kicking the body university

00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:16,840
is quite a bit with the exception of the

00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:19,900
University of Toronto and Waterloo

00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:22,630
they're very very high in the university

00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:24,550
rankings for a lot of things and with

00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:26,440
much smaller size so think of how many

00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,760
students are the University of Toronto

00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,480
in the computer science department in

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,280
Waterloo so percentage number of users

00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,620
of Seneca stirred students versus

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,720
percentage of U of T or Waterloo

00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:41,560
students is way way way way higher

00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:43,270
that's amazing no not in anywhere recent

00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:47,980
history have you seen colleges be able

00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:50,740
to eclipse universities of 102 300 year

00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:52,510
old stature on on an area of specialty

00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,640
so Seneca is really unique in that

00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,230
respect you see Sheridan's down there as

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,140
well it's doing a few things but it's

00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:00,250
not huge yet what about activities are

00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,650
went backwards sorry what about bug

00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:04,390
reports senecas absolutely holding its

00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:06,370
own it's right up there in the top with

00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:09,220
the bug reports and it's consistent over

00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:11,680
time there are certainly spikes but it's

00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:14,170
always there you see consistent activity

00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,720
from Seneca relative to the universities

00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:18,970
what about activities oh my goodness

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,470
remember we said you have key had a lot

00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,180
of gatekeeping and was doing a lot of

00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,010
the activity management turns out that

00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:26,890
it's less than one-third of what Seneca

00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:29,020
is doing Seneca is a huge gatekeeper in

00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,880
Mozilla communities and you can see that

00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,320
clearly in this graph total eclipse in

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,270
the other universities in terms of

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,520
control of what's going on in the

00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:39,250
directions of the muzzle of projects Wow

00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,590
and you know we can hypothesize about

00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,960
that but now we have the data and the

00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:45,070
pretty graphs that you can put on the

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,930
plasters of the Seneca muzzle a

00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:49,050
partnership and say look we're making

00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:51,700
you've team Waterloo you know

00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:55,210
embarrassed that's amazing that's really

00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:57,070
cool what about following so following

00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:59,260
is when you follow another user in

00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:01,840
bugzilla so that you get notified of

00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:03,340
whatever they're involved in you get

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,320
bugged mail and you can get a sense of

00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,820
what's going on with that so that's sort

00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,860
of a measure of how much do you care

00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,600
about what anybody but you is doing

00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:13,840
that's a really interesting measure

00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:15,490
turns out u of t waterloo and most of

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,650
the universities don't really care that

00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:20,260
much about what anybody but themselves

00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,950
are doing except seneca senate guys

00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,420
paying

00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,860
lot of attention to what people are

00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:26,470
doing that are not at Seneca and

00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,910
involved in that broader sense so that

00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:29,470
gives you insight again about the

00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:31,030
strategy the universities are

00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,260
navel-gazing a little bit and saying

00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,720
yeah we're doing this cool research

00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:36,250
project I'm 10-year la de la la and

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,360
Senate cuz going yeah that's great but

00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,820
what's going on over here what's going

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:44,440
on over here how can I help here that's

00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:46,810
really cool again what about votes so we

00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,870
see that some universities suddenly drop

00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:51,400
up and are voting for bugs more than

00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:54,010
others apparently the University of

00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,900
Saskatchewan has a something bug up its

00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:57,880
bum you know on a particular bug or

00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,070
particular set of bugs because it has a

00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,840
lot of votes in there but you don't see

00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:05,950
them with a lot of users or activities

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,900
or bug contributions so they're sort of

00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,730
saying hey do stuff for us but we're not

00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,100
really going to contribute by any other

00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:14,380
means that's really interesting to they

00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,480
don't show up anywhere else Seneca about

00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:18,190
the same level as University of Toronto

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,440
and Waterloo so there's involvement but

00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:22,680
there isn't sort of this offset demand

00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,680
yeah

00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:36,810
very good question I will answer that

00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:39,000
later in the presentation disclaimer i

00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:41,220
am absolutely building a story around

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,170
this and storytelling no question I

00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,630
justify that two ways one it's

00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:48,180
interesting and that's really important

00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:49,860
to I have a lot of qualitative data that

00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,630
doesn't show up here and so the

00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:54,570
qualitative data is independent of the

00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:55,950
numbers and I'm paraphrasing two or

00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:58,290
three years worth of research and

00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:00,480
talking with people that I can't justify

00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:02,760
on this slide but that I believe that

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,000
this narrative is true obviously I'm

00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:08,040
exaggerating a lot but we will do a

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,010
quantitative analysis and significance

00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:13,920
that's a very very good point patches

00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:15,810
who's contributing patches boom Seneca

00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:19,920
pretty much no one else is contributing

00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:23,730
patches wow wow that's huge is that

00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:26,340
significant absolutely so you know 41

00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:29,190
patches contribute in 2008 for Seneca

00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:30,810
Wow so again that's around the seedot

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,720
formation starting to do big stuff

00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:35,940
they're probably David Humphries can be

00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,020
credited with that that's really

00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,330
interesting so I did this organization

00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:41,580
level not individual level and that's

00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:43,850
deliberate so that we can aggregate that

00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,850
yes

00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:58,620
it absolutely does make sense bugzilla

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,860
doesn't track that so there's actually a

00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:04,740
separate database that tracks the actual

00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,000
code itself and there's a study out of

00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,830
the University of Waterloo where they

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,720
tried to link up what goes on in the

00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:11,520
bugzilla database with this code

00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,950
database and they found that they can't

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,080
do it they can't line up the two because

00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:18,510
they weren't written with cross-linking

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,659
in mind and so if you try to link that

00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:24,059
up the fuzziness of the poor linking

00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:25,590
overlays any useful data and that sucks

00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:27,179
and that's something we want to improve

00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:31,919
but these systems weren't build with

00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:34,080
researchers in mind so caveat there are

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,480
obvious limitations to what I'm talking

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,429
about and not understanding relative

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,890
size of the patches is absolutely one

00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:43,200
look at phase two of the branch I do

00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:45,690
have measures of patch sizes so that's a

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,919
lot more interesting but it's it's it's

00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:49,169
slightly different it doesn't use that

00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:55,860
external database inside a scope for

00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:57,720
today's presentation what about comments

00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:00,539
we see some distribution of comments

00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,700
again Seneca very involved university of

00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:04,679
toronto was involved a lot more early on

00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,450
and then that tapered off University of

00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:08,159
Waterloo a lot more recently that's

00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:10,049
really interesting as well so what's

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,120
next for Seneca well maybe someday we'll

00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:13,980
have Seneca University Senate already

00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,720
has seven campuses in the number of

00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,970
partnerships how much would it take to

00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,950
you know become the next Ryerson of

00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:21,690
Canada and built into university status

00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:23,490
certainly in terms of open source it's

00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:25,169
at that level and it's able to you know

00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:27,000
make that arguments but there's more

00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:30,000
than that there's a joint bachelor

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,440
programs in progress there's a big

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,970
partnership with India and a big

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,049
partnership with China that's going on

00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,520
with Seneca I don't know if you guys

00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:37,559
know about this they're bringing in

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,880
massive loads of students and hopefully

00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:40,470
they will learn from all the mistakes

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,880
they made with the Brazil partnership

00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,740
over the past five years which fell

00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,630
apart so hopefully that will go a lot

00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:48,149
better but that's great for open source

00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:50,399
as well because we see especially at

00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:53,580
Mozilla a lot of non-north American

00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:55,020
centric advances so India China South

00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,700
America those are really important

00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,370
markets and having students who are

00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:01,440
educated in world-class open-source

00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:03,450
development at Seneca from those

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,740
geographies can both contribute to open

00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,750
source communities

00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,070
while they're here and when they go back

00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:10,380
home in terms of things like

00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:12,390
translations and regionalization is only

00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,490
the start then you have how they build

00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:16,500
up their local communities so for

00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:18,240
example one of my friends Marcus who was

00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,950
here a few years ago he went back home

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,050
and now he runs the muzzle of Brazil

00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:23,520
activities and you have this community

00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:25,200
in South Paulo that's growing and that's

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,670
doing development over there and I sit

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,800
on their IRC channel and I have no idea

00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:30,300
what's going on and it's awesome so

00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,040
that's the kind of stuff that we can see

00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,050
happening coming out of Seneca it's

00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,640
really cool can other colleges imitate

00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:37,710
what they're doing well we saw that

00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,600
there's a time lag effect so Senecas

00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,650
been ramping up for a long time can

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,210
other colleges or even other

00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,370
universities just jump into this

00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,570
overnight I would think not I think it

00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:47,640
would take a couple years to catch up

00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:50,520
that's a competitive advantage that

00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,410
Seneca can really leverage so you know I

00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,940
wish we had more executive level people

00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:55,710
from Seneca here so I can be like give

00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,600
CDOT more money they're like totally

00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,420
pushing your university but that's

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,340
another matter alright let's jump ship

00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:04,080
now federal government what's going on

00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,400
with the federal government guys so I

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,230
did interviews with the number of

00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,059
federal government guys and it turns out

00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:10,350
it's about avoiding bureaucracy that's

00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:12,210
your involvement in open source so

00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,590
here's a lovely quote from one of the

00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,080
interviews that I did with a government

00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:17,880
employee and the person basically says

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,650
that a government you guys might know

00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,790
this if you worked in government there's

00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:25,110
a huge culture of pressure to not

00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:26,610
collaborate with your colleagues who

00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:28,590
aren't in your direct reporting

00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:30,990
structure and that's the most ridiculous

00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:32,760
thing in the world but that's your

00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:35,040
government at pretty much every level in

00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:37,860
Canada and it happens in universities to

00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:40,200
and so open source is an interesting way

00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:42,390
of building trust and collaboration to

00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,790
get around those social constraints

00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:46,800
there are groups that have beer after

00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,790
hours where nobody can say knowing

00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,320
you're not allowing that during

00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:51,030
government time who talked about their

00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,920
government projects and how they can

00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:55,770
collaborate together on the clock so

00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:58,230
that they can you know not reinvent the

00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,309
wheel two offices over because people

00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:02,190
aren't paying attention to what's going

00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:03,840
on and that's changing but this is this

00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,910
has been a big problem so that's where

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,140
we see a lot of involvement a second big

00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:09,030
problem is what I like to call the

00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,710
vendor problem and for any of you who

00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:13,770
have worked in large government asked

00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:17,010
organizations you know that most of the

00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:18,510
business deals are the result of golf

00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:21,549
courses

00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:23,650
technical courses and this is this is

00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:25,779
not a joke this is a real thing I mean

00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:29,049
it's a joke but it's a real joke and

00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:30,940
especially happens in government and the

00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:32,380
technical people who know the most about

00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,760
what's going on the engineers the

00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,799
computer scientists in government are

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,779
not involved invited to the golf courses

00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:39,100
and so they have to deal with managers

00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:41,049
who often don't have a technical

00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,720
background who get wined and dined by

00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:46,120
executives of commercial off the self

00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,740
companies saying this is how it's done

00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,840
in industry and they come back and they

00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:51,820
tell their engineers your stupid this is

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,440
how it's done in industry please make

00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:55,870
sure that we buy this expensive project

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,549
and the engineers say that's not how

00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,080
it's done in industry it's done this way

00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:00,669
and the executives laughed at them and

00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,620
say do you want to still have a job and

00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:04,840
that's again a real thing that happens

00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,490
in these organizations so this

00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,720
particular person that I interviewed who

00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:10,450
is a government employee found a

00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,640
solution he actually worked with the

00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:15,190
open source community to push through

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,779
all of the fixes that were needed for

00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:18,490
the commercial off-the-shelf product

00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:20,440
that they were forced to buy to actually

00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:22,570
work because it didn't even work and

00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,130
they could not convince the company that

00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,500
they paid tens of thousands of dollars

00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:27,669
to to actually patch it because you know

00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,049
just because you give somebody money

00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:31,600
doesn't mean actually going to work for

00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:33,309
you in government so he pushed all the

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,380
necessary patches into the open source

00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:37,840
community and guess what happened the

00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:39,340
commercial company went stole all the

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,350
patches from the open source community

00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:43,720
put it into their clothes product and

00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:45,669
added three lines on their marketing

00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,159
page saying now supports this now

00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:49,720
supports this and suddenly they could

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,299
actually get a patch to get their

00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,159
expensive product to work this is a real

00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:56,409
thing that happens if that's not a sign

00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,260
that open source and government is like

00:32:56,409 --> 00:33:01,899
the most desperately needed thing I

00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:04,450
don't know what is so the involvement

00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:07,440
that we can see in bugzilla is in this

00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:10,570
context it's around trying to deal with

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,940
isolating social structures and vendor

00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:15,850
is having ridiculous amounts of power

00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:18,909
over the purse strings of what goes on

00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:21,399
so the US government actually very

00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:24,029
recently announced that it's going to do

00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:26,679
a trial program with open source

00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:29,530
procurement by which it means if you

00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:31,570
procure open source products at less

00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:32,260
than three thousand dollars you don't

00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:35,470
have to go through

00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:38,320
the 18-month committee 18 carbon copy

00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:40,210
processed [ __ ] to get what is

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,950
essentially a free product so they're

00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:46,150
going to trial this and everybody's like

00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:48,190
hallelujah welcome to like 1996 but

00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:51,640
that's actually a huge recognition

00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:53,650
because the US government is in fact the

00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,240
largest user of open source as an

00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:59,470
organizational entity in the world you

00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:01,930
know which department defense that's

00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:04,420
right so the guy is controlling the

00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:06,040
purse strings have been ignoring the

00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:09,429
fact that defense has been doing this

00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:12,220
for 15 years and are now saying oh we're

00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:13,720
going to try a lid but it's hilarious

00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,190
because it's sort of this tacit

00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,710
recognition that they've been screwing

00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:19,149
the pooch for so long that we're hoping

00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:22,990
that it's going to be sort of a move

00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:24,250
towards change in Canada haha but let's

00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:26,440
take a look of what it looks like in

00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,580
Canada so this is it who are the

00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,070
government departments that are

00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:32,320
contributing to bugzilla so we see in

00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:34,240
the top left their environment canada

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,500
and National Research Council are

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,820
actually two of the top contributors do

00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:43,210
any of you have friends who worked in

00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:46,120
Environment Canada yeah do they still

00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:49,060
have jobs after Harper but that's not a

00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:50,409
joke right so some of the departments

00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,940
that were doing the most important work

00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:53,980
and open source to actually you know

00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:56,020
deliver on their mandate got decimated

00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:58,660
by the recent governments who are just

00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:00,910
like ah we don't care about this science

00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:02,860
stuff NRC you've seen churn through

00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:05,290
retirement some of the most brilliant

00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:07,180
minds in Canada worked at NRC over the

00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:08,920
past 30 years advancing the internet in

00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,450
ways people have never heard of and

00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,220
those people are retiring and they're

00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:14,140
not being replaced but while they were

00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,490
around they did a lot of interesting

00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,470
stuff so that's where a lot of these

00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,940
users come from you then see a little

00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:20,350
bit of public works a little bit of

00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:23,230
Health can a little bit of Industry

00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:25,660
Canada okay users what about bug reports

00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:28,180
bug reports are actually incredibly

00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:30,820
temporal so you see bug reports from

00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:33,790
industry canada Public Works and RCMP up

00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:37,360
to 2006 and then you see absolutely

00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:40,180
nothing between 2006 and 2010 what

00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,510
happened between 2006 and 2010 in the

00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:45,450
kanay

00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:45,450
in federal government does anybody know

00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:52,120
heartburn but more specifically what's

00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:54,340
that a minority government that is

00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:56,770
exactly correct what does the minority

00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:59,620
government mean in government

00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:01,930
organizations it means you cannot do

00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:04,030
anything period full stop because we do

00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:05,470
not know if tomorrow the government will

00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,730
be dissolved and all the funding you

00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:09,640
were promised suddenly magically

00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:12,340
disappears and we were in that state in

00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:14,140
Canada for four years I happen to be

00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,600
working at elections canada for three of

00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:19,330
those four years and so i might have a

00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,860
few scars about that personally but

00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:22,990
that's exactly it there was a complete

00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:25,510
hold on everything related to IT

00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:27,880
government-wide because it was viewed as

00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:29,320
a cost center and they said tomorrow we

00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:37,120
might lose all of our funding what do we

00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:42,220
do you are absolutely right we'll get

00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:46,000
there I can guess I think your later on

00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:48,820
and further future got okay then maybe

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,770
not but you'll see other similar users

00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:54,250
so you're absolutely right bug reports

00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:56,020
is is only one it's a small measure the

00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:58,180
story that I'm telling is based on

00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:00,400
personal experience that I'm dramatizing

00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:03,190
far beyond the data that's presented

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,250
there you're right but trust me this

00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:08,800
happened this this crush and IT happened

00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:11,080
between 2006 and 2010 maybe it doesn't

00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,720
actually explain this graph but it

00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:16,390
explains the context of where these bug

00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:23,020
reports were taking place activities

00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:24,760
ribs activities we see that RCMP was

00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:27,130
heavily involved early on and then later

00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,890
on we see only Environment Canada and

00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:33,850
NRC no one else is really that involved

00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:35,710
interesting patches RCMP pretty much

00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:37,450
nobody else and again the numbers are

00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:40,480
very small so we only see four patches

00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:44,050
in 2006 what was the RCMP patching in

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,400
2006 in Mozilla and Firefox that's a

00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:50,110
really interesting question what

00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:52,720
happened to the RCMP after 2006 do you

00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:53,890
remember the RCMP Commissioner resigned

00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,420
in massive scandal

00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:58,270
the RCMP has been basically falling

00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:59,770
apart sins including especially their IT

00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:02,620
departments and what they were doing

00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:06,370
behind the scenes and it got they have a

00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:07,960
big fight with CSC and the other spy

00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:10,630
agencies in Canada about who has the

00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,820
right to do the spying probably to 2006

00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:16,180
the RCMP actually did a lot of info sack

00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:18,610
in Canada after 2006 SESAC as it's known

00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:20,560
today basically took over and so you had

00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:22,480
this interesting split in there that

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,400
maybe is related to this I can't prove

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,320
it but that happens to fit that time

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,150
frame so that's interesting your SMP

00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,890
doesn't show up in the data set at all

00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:34,090
after two thousand and second on any

00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:36,250
measure so that's interesting comment

00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:38,230
again RCMP really involved around two

00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:41,800
thousand six drops off we see that gap

00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:45,400
between 2006 2010 and then we see some

00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:47,740
NRC and Environment Canada work

00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,360
incidentally the story that I told that

00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,490
the gentleman dealing with the vendors

00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,340
he was interviewed at one of the

00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:57,190
agencies on this graph I promised I

00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:59,740
wouldn't result reveal which one but you

00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:01,210
can guess for yourselves and votes who's

00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:03,460
involved so there's not a lot of boats

00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:05,530
where we see seven votes at employment

00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:08,200
and Social Development Canada did we see

00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:09,670
them on any previous grabs no so maybe

00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,110
that's another one who's like hey fix

00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:13,060
this for us we're not going to do

00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:16,000
anything but fix this for us that's

00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:18,880
interesting so finally what happened

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,040
post 2010 everything government in the

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,730
data set drops off all of the agencies

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,740
there is nothing between 2010 2012 I'd

00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:29,230
like to see I don't have the data for

00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:32,880
2013 to present but i'd like to see if

00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:35,140
it comes back up what happened in 2010

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,510
Harper won a majority and immediately

00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:40,000
announced shared services canada which

00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:42,190
was to consolidate all IT services for

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,890
all government agencies into a single

00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:47,970
building of eight support guess who got

00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:50,860
the contract for shared services canada

00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:52,450
bell canada and a consortium do you

00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:54,550
think Bell Canada and their consortium

00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:56,260
urge didn't open source in the slightest

00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:58,360
so all the people who are involved in

00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,950
open source either got transferred to

00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,960
shared services canada and we're put

00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:04,390
under the thumb of bell canada or they

00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,040
retired and so you see no data after

00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:07,830
that that's that's also really

00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,380
interesting so what's going to happen

00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:11,790
the present with mobile with elections

00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,290
canada suddenly doing interesting stuff

00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:15,090
did you follow the election night

00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:17,880
reporting they did some interesting

00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:20,070
stuff again I'm not bitter I'll tell you

00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,320
stories later that's what beers for to

00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:24,150
tell you the election Canada scars all

00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,400
right enough about that what about the

00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:28,170
long tail so there's a few groups in the

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,000
long tail the first group is enterprise

00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:34,890
they're the bell Canada's of the world

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,390
the MTS all streams the large contract

00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,830
bidders in canva they largely do

00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:39,390
government contracts that they also get

00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:41,520
universities and so on and so forth

00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:44,610
they're the ones that the US government

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,050
blames when open source org or opened a

00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:48,570
door go remember that open government

00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:49,980
site was falls apart the cjis we have

00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:52,560
those in Canada too and they're just as

00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:54,060
bad trust me I work with them so you see

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,340
these guys showing up what's their game

00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:58,290
they want to be able to win RFPs request

00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:00,270
for proposals and one way to do that is

00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:02,070
to have more Skills listed on the

00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:04,620
proposals listing open-source

00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:06,480
competencies allows them to win more RFP

00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:08,460
so that's part of their game in being

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,580
involved there the insider perspective

00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:13,110
is talking about what happened inside

00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:16,230
these large enterprise organizations

00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:18,240
after the stock market crash a lot of

00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:20,100
these organizations had exclusive

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,290
contracts where they didn't really have

00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,910
to be competitive and then suddenly you

00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:25,160
have these various disrupters coming

00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:27,690
from different sources and the

00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:30,030
organization started panicking and the

00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:31,950
group's had to compete inside those

00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:33,810
enterprises so suddenly they looked at

00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:35,460
open source and said hey look we can

00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:37,110
compete by not having to spend half our

00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:40,260
budget by giving it to Microsoft the

00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:42,090
licenses so inside these organizations

00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:44,010
in order to improve their FB there was a

00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:46,530
culture of maybe we need to stop

00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:48,180
shunning this open source stuff so that

00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:50,670
we can make sure that we don't lose our

00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:52,350
group and get fired which happened a lot

00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:54,570
we've seen massive layoffs in these

00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:55,980
organizations across Canada so that's

00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:57,990
interesting as well the culture and

00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,520
their so this quote I won't read it to

00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:02,340
you it's from a gentleman working in an

00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:05,100
enterprise organization the second group

00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:07,320
is small and medium enterprises which is

00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:09,540
self subsets into two groups you have

00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,580
the lone IT guy who was well-known in

00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,680
open source communities who wants to

00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:15,360
scratch an itch he's got a problem that

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,490
he's gotta keep running he's got you

00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,650
know 20 users and keeps their computers

00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:21,000
running and so on and he will use open

00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,670
source where appropriate to get

00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,900
that done the second group is

00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:27,060
entrepreneurs and these are people who

00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,290
are saying hey look open source may be

00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,760
able to give me a competitive advantage

00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:31,980
because I'm not wasting money on

00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,610
licensing that's great how can we build

00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:37,800
a business model around that so here's

00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:39,540
an example of an interview about

00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,190
scratching an itch what that looks like

00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,720
how it can be very different in open

00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:44,520
source than commercial off-the-shelf

00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,750
software I won't read it to you guys

00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,130
because you guys are sold on that you

00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,810
know how that works already that's for a

00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:52,230
business audience who doesn't know what

00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:54,000
cots is the entrepreneurs they're the

00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,350
ones who look in what's going on in open

00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,990
source communities and they say hey

00:42:55,350 --> 00:43:00,690
there's opportunities to move around

00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:02,520
what what these open source products can

00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:04,470
do and I don't have to rewrite them from

00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,360
scratch I can just add to build a

00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:08,820
business application and if that

00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,770
business application is open source and

00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:12,210
i sell it to businesses that aren't

00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:13,530
software businesses it doesn't matter

00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:15,510
because they're not going to become

00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:17,790
software businesses so i don't need to

00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:19,080
protect that IP it makes no difference i

00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:20,730
can still make a revenue stream so

00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,860
that's interesting this is what they

00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:26,880
look like in the data set so we see some

00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:28,950
bell canada some nano metrics air canada

00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,840
that's interesting were they fixing bugs

00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:32,670
in firefox for their booking system

00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:35,450
that's terrible who knows but air canada

00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:38,130
is in there we see the old nortel

00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:39,780
Ubisoft doing stuff with gaming that's

00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:41,460
really interesting especially with html5

00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:44,610
stuff that's kind of cool so these are

00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:46,470
the bigger firms bug reports what are

00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:48,780
they doing what we see a couple outliers

00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:50,940
there turns out there's a select few

00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:53,460
people who do a whole lot of stuff and

00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:56,070
then there's a lot of long tail we knew

00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:58,770
that so within the long tail there are

00:43:56,070 --> 00:44:01,230
exceptional jumps these are people who

00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:03,030
are entrepreneurs who have a history in

00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:05,190
open source communities who are doing a

00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:07,620
lot they do a lot of bug reports they do

00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:09,450
a lot of activities this is the same

00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:11,040
graph at a different scale so you can

00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:13,680
see just how much more they do

00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:17,400
activities and other users so the colors

00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:19,140
are the same people over time they do a

00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,840
lot of comments a lot more than the

00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:24,360
other users again some people really

00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:26,910
Eclipse others this gentleman here has

00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:29,850
the top comments in the database period

00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:31,290
for Canadian users and you can see

00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:32,970
totally a different order

00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:35,280
of magnitude in terms of the involvement

00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:37,350
of other people in the long tail that's

00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,120
cool who is this person or who is this

00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:41,850
organization I'm not sure because that's

00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:44,520
too fine grained there's your website

00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:46,200
interestingly at this address so maybe

00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,030
that's lost to history maybe we need to

00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,650
dig around in archive org and see how

00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:51,360
this works out but you can see that

00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:53,460
there's different involvements in their

00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:56,430
patches same thing some people are

00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:58,680
patching a lot more follows same thing

00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:00,120
some people are very interested in what

00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:03,900
other people are doing others not so

00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:06,590
much votes it's a bit more balance till

00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:08,760
some up we have itches we have

00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:11,640
strategies to be more competitive and

00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,770
enterprise and where's that going well

00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:16,470
I'm curious to see especially what

00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:18,180
happens with Firefox OS so mark sermon

00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:19,350
talked about how Firefox OS hasn't

00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:21,540
really worked out the way Mozilla at

00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:22,680
hoped and that makes me sad but I want

00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:25,500
to see what that looks like in the data

00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:28,560
so most Firefox OS stuff happened after

00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:31,620
the end of 2012 and so I want to get at

00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,940
the bugzilla dump from more recently

00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,620
which is currently on lockdown because

00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,870
they're afraid of security problems

00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:38,700
other discussions to see what's going on

00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:40,320
with that so are their business models

00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,760
happening around Firefox OS that we

00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,170
don't know about that would be really

00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,490
cool so I think that's where the future

00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:48,930
is lastly before we jump to questions

00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:50,520
yeah yeah yeah yeah you told a lot of

00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:53,070
really interesting stories there but is

00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,870
it statistically valid and you know what

00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:56,850
that's what r is about at the end of the

00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:59,010
day it's not just pretty graphs so this

00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:03,720
is what the bugzilla database looks like

00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:05,700
until the end of 2012 there are seven

00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,500
hundred and seventy four thousand bugs

00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,270
now we know it's up to what about 1.3

00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,010
million something like that it's almost

00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:12,540
double since then so there's a lot of

00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:14,580
stuff that we haven't captured over the

00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:16,140
past three years half a million users

00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:18,450
approximately approximately 10 million

00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:22,560
activities canadian ones we see

00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:25,590
approximately 5,500 bugs 2,600 users

00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:28,740
making up 1,400 orgs and so on and so

00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:30,420
forth you can see some of the summary

00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:34,110
statistics of what that looks like I

00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:36,690
took a look at some measures such as can

00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:39,780
we tell if there's a difference in terms

00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:41,820
of how long bugs stay open across the

00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:44,100
types of organizations so what I'm

00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:48,980
asking is can universities or

00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:51,930
colleges or government or organizations

00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:53,640
resolve bugs faster than each other or

00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:55,740
less quickly than each other is there a

00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:58,530
pattern in there turns out the answer is

00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:01,800
yes both in terms of the number of days

00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:04,020
open and the probability of the number

00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,300
of days open being below or above a

00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:08,240
certain threshold which are various

00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,810
statistical blabby ways of measuring

00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,270
significance there's a lot of different

00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:13,860
ways you can do it in this case you'll

00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:17,250
see that there are only four groups

00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:18,780
listed their relative to college as the

00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:21,300
base one so all of these are

00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,770
probabilities relative to colleges so

00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:26,160
that we get a sense from the Seneca

00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:28,230
audience what about the probability of

00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,560
it getting fixed or not getting fixed so

00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:33,930
there's a lot of bugs that end up as

00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:36,990
rejected won't fix or duplicate or other

00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:38,820
statuses like that which ones get

00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:40,530
resolved with a fixed statuses and

00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:43,230
something productive happens out of it

00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:44,720
turns out colleges which are mostly

00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:48,090
Seneca are really good at that

00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:51,630
universities are terrible at that and sm

00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:54,810
owes small/medium organizations are you

00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:57,900
know in between governments also not so

00:47:54,810 --> 00:48:00,570
great at that enterprise and colleges

00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:03,900
are actually the most similar so that

00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:06,120
means Seneca is performing as well or

00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,400
better than the large enterprise

00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:11,130
organizations in Canada in terms of time

00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,740
of resolution of bugs and probability of

00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:15,090
a successful bug resolution that's cool

00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:16,680
and they're embarrassing the

00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:18,420
university's after embarrassing

00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,250
government and small medium

00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:23,340
organizations in that respect is a

00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:25,440
statistically significant yes it is this

00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:26,910
is a very very very small subset of the

00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,200
tests that I'm doing in the larger

00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:32,640
branch imagine this expanded for all

00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:34,350
organizations globally that's what the

00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,210
next branch will be come back next year

00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:39,000
f sauce 2016 and i'll tell you the

00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:40,950
global it preliminary it is absolutely

00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,090
statistically significant and really

00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:44,840
fascinating what some of those

00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:47,490
organizations are doing to sum it up

00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:49,440
there's a tale of five organizations in

00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:50,550
canada universities colleges government

00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,990
departments small and medium

00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:53,850
organizations and enterprise

00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:55,860
organizations they have different

00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:56,849
motivations to participate in open

00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:59,369
source and they

00:48:56,849 --> 00:49:02,579
different things out of it there are

00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:04,170
some stars in each one but their

00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:06,989
environment we now have a good

00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:09,720
contextual understanding of it and using

00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:11,339
our and analyzing the giant bugzilla

00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,960
database instead of pulling out little

00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:14,309
queries in the terrible bugzilla

00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,619
interface that we know is very difficult

00:49:14,309 --> 00:49:18,059
to use gives us a beautiful visual

00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:19,920
representation of what that looks like

00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:21,420
on the big scale and that's what I

00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,239
wanted to show you today so you can get

00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:28,309
a sense of the Canadian environment

00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:28,309
thank you very much I welcome questions

00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:46,109
yes sir so the question was other than

00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:49,920
Mozilla have I concerned measuring other

00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:54,809
stuff on my good friend Andrea Ross at

00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:57,210
eclipse is currently giving as much beer

00:49:54,809 --> 00:49:59,369
as possible to the person who has the

00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:01,469
finger on the bugzilla database and

00:49:59,369 --> 00:50:03,420
eclipse and i'm hoping to get access to

00:50:01,469 --> 00:50:04,710
that data soon it's surprisingly

00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,539
difficult to convince me to give you

00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:08,069
access to their data even if it's open

00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:11,219
source and even if they have an API to

00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:12,749
access it so I considered it but I have

00:50:11,219 --> 00:50:14,219
a lot of success if you have access to

00:50:12,749 --> 00:50:16,559
that data and you know people I should

00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:22,069
buy beers for to get access that data

00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:22,069
once let me know did yes oh yes I had

00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:31,320
so to give you a context of the size and

00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:33,930
the database of 8 gigabytes of CSV to

00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:35,850
scrape that from the bugzilla portal

00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:38,160
would be a DDoS attack effective

00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:40,350
effectively so it's not practical to

00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,210
scrape between the api's without totally

00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:43,920
destroying their servers the type of

00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:45,660
analysis that I'm doing is on the whole

00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,730
database and actually hold it all in RAM

00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:49,500
to do the matrix computations which is

00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:52,680
pretty cool you can't do that through AP

00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:54,210
is it's just not possible the compu

00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,150
stack database that i'm using right now

00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:58,320
which allows me to link the

00:50:56,150 --> 00:51:00,810
organization's performance an open

00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:03,630
source with their stock market price the

00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:05,520
revenue their number of sales their cost

00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:07,500
centers all that data that's published

00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,480
at the security Exchange Commission that

00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:12,480
database is up is somewhere in the order

00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,770
of 15 gigabytes and so I was able to

00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,900
pull that from a certain cruise

00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:17,640
somewhere but you can't you can't siphon

00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,740
that and so the interactions of the

00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:22,109
torch is way too large the screens great

00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:23,550
that's the nature of my research for

00:51:22,109 --> 00:51:25,290
different types of research you

00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:29,119
absolutely can do it but not the way I

00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:29,119
am someone else advice yeah

00:51:41,059 --> 00:51:54,809
absolutely normal I'm work yeah so the

00:51:53,309 --> 00:51:56,700
question was about privacy concerns in

00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:59,190
the data so it was addressed three ways

00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:01,230
one when I made the request to Mozilla

00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:03,119
we went through a policy procedure that

00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:04,890
they have to validate this and it was

00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,420
agreed at the highest levels of muzzle

00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:09,000
that the data that I'm using is actually

00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:11,400
public and so it's not there's no

00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,869
expectation of privacy in the users that

00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,339
are contributing to this and it's part

00:52:12,869 --> 00:52:16,260
of the user submission agreement that

00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:18,299
it's public so alrighty there's no

00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:20,579
expectation of privacy the second way

00:52:18,299 --> 00:52:22,559
this was validated is that I tried a

00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:24,599
grenade the organization level you're

00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,819
right that in some cases whether is very

00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:28,829
small that could identify certain users

00:52:26,819 --> 00:52:31,980
such I mentioned David on the breeze at

00:52:28,829 --> 00:52:34,230
Seneca but in by and large certainly

00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:36,240
beyond the Canadian subset it's very

00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:37,920
difficult identify individual users and

00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:40,200
the third way is that this went through

00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,359
the ethics review committee at York who

00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:44,220
looked at it and they issued an okay

00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:45,750
that this was ethically appropriate so

00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:53,599
that was absolutely considered and

00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:53,599
handled of course I use

00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:03,750
absolutely em so if you look at my f

00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:05,190
sauce presentations in 2014 I bring the

00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,870
whole theoretically primary can put into

00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:08,490
their I didn't put it back up today

00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:10,740
because it's too much information but

00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:13,500
Golan is in 2014 slides the theoretical

00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:15,450
framework is essentially in business we

00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,820
have what we call the knowledge base

00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:19,710
view of the firm which is the idea the

00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:21,390
old closed source idea is that to

00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:23,010
protect your business model you have to

00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:25,050
keep all your knowledge inside the

00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:26,940
organization and if it spills over your

00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:28,920
commander message is destroyed that's a

00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:30,900
business theory and it's the closest

00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,760
business then we have to understand open

00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:35,490
source which gives you an idea of how

00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:37,520
old and archaic business theories are so

00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:39,870
I've used this serie to essentially say

00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,930
selectively revealing certain knowledge

00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:45,450
outside of organization boundaries will

00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:47,640
bring you back knowledge that you could

00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:49,950
not have created yourself in that

00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:52,230
organization and the way I describe that

00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:54,330
is you put a bug report out there you're

00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:56,160
saying hey me at this organization I

00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:58,080
have this problem that I need to fix

00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,030
your competitors suddenly find out that

00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:02,340
you have this problem but then you might

00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:04,410
get back useful information in the form

00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:05,700
of a bug fix that someone has helped you

00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:08,190
resolve that problem we call that

00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,720
solution knowledge and that that can

00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:12,810
enable your competitor advantage

00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:15,800
interestingly if you manipulate this

00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:19,740
strategically you can actually induce

00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:22,110
your competitors to follow you and do

00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:23,520
more of what you're doing and when

00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:26,100
someone is following you you are

00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,930
necessarily the leader so you can do

00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:30,210
really interesting things strategically

00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:31,710
to force people to follow you in the

00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:33,540
market and that's where I really

00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:35,280
interested in Firefox and rats for

00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:37,180
example the partnership with Panasonic

00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,550
what r LG and Samsung

00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:41,319
about that I'm really curious what Apple

00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:43,599
and Google doing about that I'm really

00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:45,069
curious so there's interesting things in

00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,930
there about from a theoretical

00:54:45,069 --> 00:54:48,849
perspective how does the knowledge full

00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:50,740
effect strategy in this organization

00:54:48,849 --> 00:54:55,690
very good question you must be a

00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:57,280
business scholar doing more topical we

00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:59,559
have a time now I think we're out of

00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:02,790
time a private conversation afterwards

00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:02,790
