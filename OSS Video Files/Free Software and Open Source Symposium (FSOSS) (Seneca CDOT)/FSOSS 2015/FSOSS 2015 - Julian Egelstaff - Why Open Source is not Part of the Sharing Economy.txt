okay you can hear me great so I'm Julian

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,660
and like to thank the eff sauce

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,509
organizers for inviting me back to talk

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,010
to you guys this year about a more

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,289
meditative kind of topic this is not

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,050
technical I don't have lots of graphs

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:25,080
like Becky had I don't have lots of data

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,060
I don't have I don't have lots of sort

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,609
of tried and true processes to go

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,009
through like Josh did tell us about how

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,460
to get our communities to run better but

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:38,879
I spent a lot of time about 15 years

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,680
working with open source software and i

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,300
founded a nonprofit organization that

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,210
uses open source software to help other

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,370
nonprofit organizations so I literally

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:51,420
have made my living off open source for

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:53,910
a long time and we've seen a lot of

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,250
things happen over the years with you

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,109
know is Linux ready for the desktop is

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,780
open source you know where's it going is

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:04,170
it taking over the world you know are we

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,750
beating Microsoft etc and you know

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,299
lately there's a lot of talk about the

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,970
sharing economy I think open source is

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,460
often thought of as part of that I have

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,380
some ideas that I've tried to put

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,220
together here that I'll share with you

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:24,000
so that's sharing and hopefully it's not

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,770
provoking and maybe we'll discuss

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,299
definitions and other arbitrary things

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,040
like that which always come into play in

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:34,650
these discussions but I hope you find it

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:36,600
interesting so in 2011 Time magazine did

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,579
an article that said 10 ideas that will

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,460
change the world and sharing was number

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,229
eight in the same year open source com

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,960
there was an article the new sharing

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,340
economy a quote from that is sharing is

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,530
changing the way we work and live

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,060
together as a society if you were

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,530
working with technology and open source

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,610
in the last few years hopefully this

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:59,219
sort of zeitgeist sounds familiar it's

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,790
certainly something that I picked up on

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,590
and felt like Oh open sources you know

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,129
are we having an influence or what's

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,479
going on here there's this vague idea a

00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:11,190
bandwagon or I think maybe a retcon

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,530
story if you're in

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:17,250
science fiction fantasy stuff and

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,750
role-playing and and fan fiction you

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,030
know we might look back at what's

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,860
happened and we do a retcon story to say

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:26,130
well what what really happens now that

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,020
we know from our future perspective we

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,620
know that open source is linked to all

00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,930
this somehow and I think that story goes

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,970
something like this open source led the

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,550
way it came first and then there was

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,310
sharing music on Napster and now we're

00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,410
couchsurfing and there's air B&B and

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,180
there's you know all the you can pick

00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,360
and choose different things to put into

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,980
this story but you know who has had a

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,960
conversation like this with somebody at

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,660
some point about open source and

00:02:51,960 --> 00:03:04,860
technology and where it's all going

00:02:53,660 --> 00:03:20,520
where it came from one sharing with us

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:36,239
right now fascinating they're fixing it

00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:38,580
now okay that's good all right that it

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,600
I'll be back to our regularly scheduled

00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:45,150
presentation all right

00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:47,320
so we'll see if anybody else interrupts

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,930
the common thread between all that stuff

00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,970
is sharing right like an open source we

00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,040
share a lot of stuff and all these

00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:58,420
models that people talk about there's

00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:03,550
sharing going on of some kind you know

00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:05,590
sharing I think the idea of not you know

00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,810
the there's an aspect of all these

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,950
models which is not based on selling you

00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,020
something or paying a price for

00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:17,739
something there's a somehow a different

00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:19,900
cost model is is worked in so the common

00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:22,950
thread among these things in all these

00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:25,660
versions of the stories is sharing but I

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:29,530
don't think sharing is what defines open

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,880
source and I don't think it's actually

00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,120
what defines a lot of what we call the

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,660
sharing economy either and I think that

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,820
if we think of what today are I believe

00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,690
the widely regarded exemplars of the

00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:47,590
sharing economy something like Airbnb

00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:49,600
you're sharing your space but you're not

00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,960
giving it away you're not you're not co

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,600
creating a space with people you're

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:58,360
you're offering something that you have

00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,040
but it's the interactions between the

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,750
participants are not the same as they

00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:06,190
are in an open source uber you can share

00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,310
your passenger seat in your car with

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:12,880
somebody else for a fee you know you can

00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:16,390
use this sort of surplus resources and

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,040
share them perhaps but you know the

00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,770
economics of these systems aren't driven

00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:24,130
by sharing their driven by driving value

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:27,610
from the surplus whether it's the spare

00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:29,920
room or the spare seat in your car and I

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,530
think truly open systems like open

00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:36,540
source the driving factor is abundance

00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:38,440
instead of scarcity it's the infinity of

00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,700
sharing as many copies of the source

00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,790
code with as many people as you want

00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,740
that drives open source now that

00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:47,380
abundance leads to a whole lot of

00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,210
sharing but the sharing is the side

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,330
effect it's not the fundamental thing

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,160
that that defines the system the value

00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,980
in an open

00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,810
just like open source software is

00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:00,360
created from that abundance by a

00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:03,420
community that engages in the sharing

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,790
and what Josh was talking about two

00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:09,360
presentations ago i think is essentially

00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:13,170
the recipe for community what if you've

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,930
got this abundant resource what does the

00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:19,170
community need to do to create value

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:21,270
around that resource and you know it's

00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,220
not as simple as release early off and

00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,810
often and everything else is you know

00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,230
going to work there's a lot more you

00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:32,040
have to do but the fundamental enabler

00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:35,070
of that is the abundance of the resource

00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,370
that you're that you're sharing so

00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:41,250
here's a bunch of examples I want to UM

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,780
I'll look through a few things here some

00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,600
which are familiar and some of which I

00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:49,770
think will be very on the left field

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,050
we'll see we'll see what you think so

00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:53,310
open source well the resource we're

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,340
talking about a source code the

00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:59,340
expertise to develop source code and

00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:01,410
when the resources scares it's a little

00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,720
small there but when the resource is

00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:06,540
scarce then you drive value by hoarding

00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,530
source code by selling the software from

00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,570
the source code that people don't have

00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,850
access to this is what Microsoft does

00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,890
this is what it should be very familiar

00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,600
to everyone in the room the commercial

00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:19,410
software model when the resource is

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:22,290
abundant then many eyes make all bugs

00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:23,790
shallow we know about analyses that say

00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:26,370
open source software is better privacy

00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:28,950
and security than closed-source software

00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,919
for because of the number of people

00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:33,060
involved and because it's open and

00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:35,940
ultimately you have this ecosystem of

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,340
people you have a community that creates

00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,560
services around the software supports

00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,900
the software and that maximizes the

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,300
benefits of everyone who's participating

00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,950
so that you know you have this abundant

00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:51,540
source code and everyone everyone

00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:54,060
benefits wikipedia mark the keynote

00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,760
right here earlier today was talking

00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,220
about wikipedia as encyclopedias as an

00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,639
accessible example of open systems and

00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,189
obviously

00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,110
talking about Wikipedia very similar to

00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:07,740
open source you're not talking about

00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:09,779
source code talking about knowledge and

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,669
the ability to research information and

00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:13,139
a whole lot of ability dealing was

00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:16,229
writing and communicating and editing

00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:18,080
and so on if you ever dug into behind

00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:21,419
the scenes in Wikipedia and looked at

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,580
change requests back on forests on pages

00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:27,659
and all the you ever read the talk page

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:29,939
for active Wikipedia pages that's a very

00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:33,690
interesting sausage factory and it's a

00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:36,409
lot like what you might see in a bug

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:40,860
request or bug reports and open source

00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:42,510
where things are marked as won't fix if

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,160
you cut a lot of discussion like that in

00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:50,670
Wikipedia now in the old model like

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,380
microsoft encarta or Britannica you know

00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,610
you hoard all that expertise to deal

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:58,199
with all that stuff when you sell

00:08:53,610 --> 00:09:01,199
encyclopedias in the abundant model like

00:08:58,199 --> 00:09:02,790
Wikipedia supposedly studies tell us

00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:05,220
there's actually better accuracy in

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,230
Wikipedia it's much broader than any

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:11,269
other encyclopedia covers so much more

00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:13,680
stuff just look at the Star Wars page of

00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:17,699
Wikipedia versus certain pages about

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:21,089
actual astronomical phenomenon the

00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:23,040
breadth is impressive and it's very

00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:24,779
timely have you ever gone to Wikipedia

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,769
to look at things that are happening

00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:30,600
right now news events it's pretty

00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:33,480
impressive so you got a whole community

00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,029
of people again working around that body

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,769
of knowledge it's shared and abundant

00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:39,360
and open but it's that community that

00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:41,690
then harnesses that works together and

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,220
makes it useful for everyone

00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:47,160
interestingly enough i think there's

00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,290
similar reticence on the part of many

00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,899
more conservative or traditional

00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:56,190
elements of society to using wikipedia

00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:58,050
because we probably all heard academics

00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:00,899
or others say they distrust wikipedia

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:03,570
because of you know anybody can

00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:07,680
contribute things there's no and there

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:09,180
was the spin-off I'm forgetting the name

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,620
of it but there was a prominent spin-off

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,000
where they were going to place

00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:20,940
prominence for expert at it

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:23,170
over you no edits by just lay people and

00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,880
yeah so I think there's sort of there's

00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,040
some people have a distrust of it and

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,680
just fact anybody can edit it you know

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,850
school teachers well anybody you've

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,650
caused on Wikipedia what I doesn't mean

00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,090
anything because anybody could edit but

00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,400
you know studies have shown that it is

00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:38,710
generally pretty accurate and with open

00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,600
source software of course we've all

00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:42,370
heard people criticized open source

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,610
software cuts well it's free so it can't

00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:47,050
be good or you know it's anybody has

00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,940
access to the source code so you can

00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,440
figure out all the security holes so

00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,360
therefore it's not secure you like

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,450
there's all these sort of non sequitur

00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,210
arguments for these things that that try

00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:01,480
to turn where their strengths into

00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:04,240
perceived weaknesses now renewable

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,730
energies maybe not something you're used

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,840
to thinking about as a potential open

00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:12,370
system but I think renewable energy is

00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,870
very interesting I have solar power

00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,340
array on the roof of my house I've been

00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:19,170
thinking about this a lot for a few

00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:22,200
years and with renewable energy sources

00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:25,300
the electricity comes for free basically

00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,490
you don't have to buy natural gas and

00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,170
burn it to make electricity you just

00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,940
have the solar panels on your roof and

00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:34,870
you get electricity just because the sun

00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:38,140
shining so in a in a natural gas

00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:41,010
electricity whole system or you know

00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:44,770
fossil fuel-based electrical system and

00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:46,390
the price of energy comes from the cost

00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:49,089
to produce which is highly affected by

00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:52,780
the fuel not so much in nuclear reactors

00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:55,300
because you can get so much energy from

00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:58,089
splitting a uranium atom that the fuel

00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:01,690
ratio is a bit different but there is

00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:02,950
still fuel there and and of course your

00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,510
access to the fuel and control the

00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:07,600
markets and fluctuations in that price

00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:09,820
are very significant whereas if you

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,790
imagine a whole electricity system based

00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,680
around totally renewable sources then

00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,830
the only real cost is the infrastructure

00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,850
the energy itself comes for free how

00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,790
would how would that make things

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:24,230
different well problem is it's fun to

00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:28,040
think about but the problem is

00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:31,650
energy storage is not a solved problem

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:33,900
like imagine if with open source we had

00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,270
all this distribution of source code but

00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:38,820
rather than it just sort of being there

00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:42,750
on the website to download at any point

00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:44,340
in time you know you could only download

00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,110
like there was a limited number of

00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:50,580
copies to download only certain times a

00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:51,870
day well that wouldn't work so well and

00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,850
that's essentially the problem with our

00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,380
electricity system we need to constantly

00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:57,300
produce electricity into the power grid

00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,310
because we can't really store it there's

00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,580
no effective ways of storing it on a

00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:05,370
large scale and there's also of course

00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,540
no community of people like it doesn't

00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,790
match the other models there's no

00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:14,130
community of people engaged in enabling

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:15,150
the sharing or use of that resource but

00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,040
i think is very interesting to think

00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:20,910
about the like there's a potential

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,950
abundance there in renewable energy the

00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,540
principal difference between that and

00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:28,110
traditional forms is the abundance of

00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:29,910
the resource itself and so the what are

00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,340
the then you know what are the barriers

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:34,920
to that becoming open in the way that

00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:41,420
open sources I think it's the storage in

00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:45,030
the community airbnb exempt are of of

00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:47,900
the sharing economy so-called well the

00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:52,250
resource in that case is accommodation

00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:52,250
York Oh late let there be light

00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:56,910
accommodations that's the resource for

00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:58,560
talking about and in the traditional

00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,660
model you go to a hotel or wherever and

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,550
you charge for rooms based on what the

00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,830
markets going to what price market will

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:08,520
bear Airbnb is not much different who's

00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:11,420
ready to place on Airbnb yeah and you

00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:16,560
shop around based on price don't you

00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:18,360
it's I think yeah there's sharing its

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,340
may be related to these ideas in a very

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,840
nebulous way but I don't think it bears

00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,470
much resemblance to open source at all

00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:28,470
and if we try to think of what an

00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:33,180
abundance based view of the

00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:36,550
accommodations resource would be I don't

00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:40,120
know what does an infinite supply of

00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:42,339
accommodations look like really maybe

00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:46,870
couchsurfing anybody use couchsurfing

00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:48,130
org so maybe that's more in that line

00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,120
but i don't know i think really the

00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,630
fundamental difference there is the

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:56,470
price is zero or very low and they're

00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:58,450
certainly again not a community that

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,839
exists to support people's access and

00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:03,670
use of abundant accommodations there's a

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,839
lot of social interaction on Airbnb

00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:10,480
rating people back and forth and you

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,920
know people people sort of know each

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,560
other a bit they try to build a bit of a

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:19,510
social network aspect in there but it's

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,760
the engagement of those people in a

00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,709
variety of activities to support the use

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,990
of the accommodator to sort of enable

00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:27,579
the use of the accommodation it's not

00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:31,860
really the same of some of the other

00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:36,910
examples Napster who remembers Napster

00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:40,149
yes lots of hands if we look at the

00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:41,440
resource being music I think naps

00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:44,829
there's a really interesting example

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,520
because for a little while their music

00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:53,829
was which is normally of course sold by

00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:56,680
big corporations on various media music

00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:57,910
is a very limited resource in that

00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,770
traditional model and we all know that

00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:02,310
that model has changed and the price of

00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:05,950
music has now bottom doubt completely

00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:07,600
and with Napster for a brief time there

00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:09,370
was a community of users that freely and

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,589
voluntarily contributed into that system

00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:13,899
I'll put all my music in and you put all

00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:15,190
your music in and everyone was

00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:17,050
benefiting from the contributions of

00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:20,140
others in what was essentially an

00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:22,089
infinite resource I know lots of people

00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:24,339
who have extremely large music

00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:28,779
collections because they got it all at

00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:31,120
that point in time no it wasn't the

00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:34,000
creators have put it in and the problem

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,140
was it was illegal due to IP issues like

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,640
there was an abundance but it was in

00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:42,220
illegal abundance like with open source

00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:45,190
I am with Wikipedia everything's sort of

00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:47,380
given freely whereas Napster there was

00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,630
an abundant resource that was

00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:52,450
essentially illegally co-opted into

00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:54,130
this this kind of ecosystem so I think

00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:58,120
it was actually in a way fit the model

00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:59,730
of an open system but not totally like

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,550
there was a significant barrier there

00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:05,230
Creative Commons is an interesting view

00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:08,920
if you think about layering creative

00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:10,329
commons / this yes all of the music and

00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,000
Napster was licensed under creative

00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:16,120
commons at the time no problem but of

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:21,069
course it wasn't and you know the

00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:23,199
barrier to making that happen is that

00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:24,640
the creators of all the music was there

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,310
aren't going to relicense their stuff

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,730
right because it defeats the whole

00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:34,690
business model and you know unlike

00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:36,190
wikipedia where to some extent there's a

00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:38,230
commoditization of knowledge that

00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:40,900
happens because you just bring all these

00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:42,340
people to bear and then everything is

00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:46,060
knowable and everything can be written

00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:49,930
about when it comes to a more personally

00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:51,880
creative activity like music you know

00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:54,070
you and I can't just go and recreate the

00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:57,330
you know all the songs or the Rolling

00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:59,740
Stones it's just not going to happen so

00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:02,800
yeah it's it's sort of close but not

00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:05,800
quite now last one that I put up their

00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,290
open relationships love is the resource

00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,480
I love this example because i think is

00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:13,390
so out of left field that those of us

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,500
who work with open source are used to

00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,880
think about open source we think it's

00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,580
all natural normal and perfectly fine

00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,050
and a lot of the rest of the world looks

00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,330
at it and goes you give away your source

00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:24,910
code like you give away the software so

00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,470
how do you make money and a lot of the

00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:29,440
rest of the world thinks we're crazy and

00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:31,870
we don't really get why they think we're

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,080
crazy but if we walk through this

00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:37,210
example maybe you'll understand how the

00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,370
rest of the world views us it's open

00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:42,040
source because unless you're involved in

00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:46,990
open relationships this is kind of weird

00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:50,260
so normally we think about love in terms

00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:52,000
of well I'm going to find the one I'm

00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,770
going to be there one person they're

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,630
going to be my one person we're going to

00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:58,270
be monogamous we're going to love each

00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:01,030
other forever and if either of us loves

00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:02,650
anybody else then it's all going to go

00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,250
to hell in a handbasket because love is

00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,440
a scary

00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,790
source and its precious and if I love

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,420
anybody else and there's less love for

00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:13,090
the person that that I pledge myself to

00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:15,790
people who have open relationships view

00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:18,910
it the other way around you're open to

00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:20,530
loving more than one person they're open

00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:25,360
to loving more than one person besides

00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:28,720
you and that doesn't reduce the love it

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:31,210
adds love to their lives and so there's

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,160
this community of people who all care

00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:35,260
for and support each other in a network

00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,800
depending on how your relationships are

00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:41,320
organized and it's all just based on how

00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:44,260
people are connected to each other and

00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,580
they don't consider that to diminish

00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:49,800
their connections to anyone in

00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:52,360
particular now maybe that sounds weird

00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:54,580
it is weird to a lot of people but so is

00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:58,000
open source and I think it's a

00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:00,070
interesting view of a resource that is

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,400
often thought of it scarce but many

00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:06,210
people treat his abundant so is it open

00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:09,040
based on this too based on my discussion

00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,470
and you may differ on one or more of

00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,500
these points I think open source clearly

00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:15,820
is an open system and Wikipedia

00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:19,990
renewable energy not so much as

00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:23,410
discussed Airbnb definitely not Napster

00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:25,510
yeah almost except for the legal aspect

00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:27,880
there's a there's something preventing

00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:31,540
the necessary factors from all

00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:35,440
coalescing there and in open

00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:37,420
relationships yes so what do these

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,510
things have in common the the things

00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:43,930
that are successful open systems versus

00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:45,670
not well open source the resource is

00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,900
what I think a lot of this hinges around

00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:50,530
is the nature of the resource it's

00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:53,380
abstract it's not a it's it's almost

00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:56,170
like a metaphysical entity like the

00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,070
source code exists is 10 somewhere

00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,240
there's sort of a physical

00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:01,090
representation of it in the memory of

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,090
the computer but fundamentally it's a

00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:07,540
it's an abstract almost like a mental

00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:10,780
resource same thing with the knowledge

00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:12,640
and the expertise that allows Wikipedia

00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:15,340
that happen whereas renewable energy

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:20,330
it's a it's a physical resource

00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:24,110
it's limited in supply and and storage

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:27,710
and the and the distribution method is

00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:30,220
under strict control as well and it's

00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:32,540
not there's no commoditize distribution

00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,280
accommodations obviously physical you

00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:41,360
can only build so many hotels houses

00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:42,530
salon music well the music recordings

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,180
aren't much different than source code

00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:46,010
at least in the way the Napster system

00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:49,100
works so i declare that as an abstract

00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:52,010
just abstract resource as well and love

00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,070
is certainly not a physical thing so

00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,940
what can we take from that so that I

00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:58,520
think the hallmark of a truly open

00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,710
system is there's a community arising

00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,620
around this abstract abundant resource

00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:07,130
that promotes and supports the use of

00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:11,570
that resource and that's what I think

00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:13,610
makes open source open source and why

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:17,540
things that people lump into the sharing

00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:19,430
economy aren't really the same thing in

00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,530
fact I think when you think about those

00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:23,360
examples I went through and and that

00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:25,250
definition I think far from being

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,430
mainstream like the sharing economy that

00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:30,890
gets all this attention in news media

00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:34,070
the communities that drive open source

00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:38,120
systems are outliers we're the oddballs

00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:39,500
we are really really unusual and I think

00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,210
one of the best examples of this that

00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:45,410
I'll just go through very briefly is

00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:47,150
from a long essay called in the

00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,440
beginning was the command line by neal

00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,450
stephenson which some of you i'm sure

00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,360
have read some of you i'm sure enough

00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:56,090
and one of my favorite things about this

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,390
is near the beginning he compares

00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:00,700
operating systems to car dealerships

00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,720
clustered around an intersection and

00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,460
microsoft is the dealership on one

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,980
corner selling these colossal station

00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:09,650
wagons that you know spew exhausts and

00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:12,350
and clunk along and have no style

00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:15,170
whatsoever Apple is on another corner

00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:16,940
selling sleek euro styled sedans that

00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:18,650
are hermetically sealed so you can't

00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,050
fiddle with the insides but they're

00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,940
beautiful and then be us is on the third

00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:25,850
corner selling fully operational

00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,020
Batmobiles that shows the timeframe when

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:28,190
he wrote this that he was writing about

00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,740
be us

00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:33,500
so it's kind of old and then on the

00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:35,750
fourth corner is Linux right next door

00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:38,809
it's not a business at all it's a bunch

00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:40,370
of RVs your TPS and geodesic domes set

00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:42,769
up in a field and organized by consensus

00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:45,409
and the people who live there are making

00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:47,299
tanks not cars and these are not old

00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:49,700
fashioned cast-iron soviet tanks they're

00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:51,950
more like m1 tanks of the US Army made

00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,750
of space-age materials jammed with

00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:56,179
sophisticated technology from one end to

00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:57,740
the other but they're better than army

00:23:56,179 --> 00:23:59,570
tanks because they've been modified in

00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,190
such a way that they never ever break

00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,379
down their light and maneuverable enough

00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,600
to use on ordinary streets and they use

00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:07,429
no more fuel than a subcompact car and

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,169
these tanks are being cranked out on the

00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:10,639
spot at a terrific pace and a vast

00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:12,500
number of them are lined up along the

00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:15,019
edge of the road with the keys in the

00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,279
ignition and anyone who wants can simply

00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:19,220
climb into one and drive it away for

00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:21,529
free abundant tanks it's an abundant

00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,659
resource now the group giving away the

00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:26,509
free tanks only stays alive because it

00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:27,860
is staffed by volunteers a community who

00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:29,360
are lined up at the edge of the street

00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,549
with bullhorns trying to draw customers

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,529
attention to this incredible situation a

00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:36,950
typical conversation goes something like

00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:39,080
this save your money except one of our

00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,850
free tanks it is invulnerable can drive

00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,590
across rocks and swamps at 90 miles an

00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,990
hour well getting a hundred miles to the

00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:47,029
gallon and the prospective station wagon

00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:49,429
buyer says I know what you say is true

00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:51,080
but I don't know how to maintain a tank

00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:54,620
well you don't know how to maintain a

00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:56,539
station wagon either but this dealership

00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,799
over here has mechanics on stuff and if

00:24:56,539 --> 00:24:59,870
something goes wrong with my station

00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:01,610
wagon I can take a day off word bring it

00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,870
here and pay them to work on it while I

00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,570
sit in the waiting room for hours

00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:07,129
listening to elevator music but if you

00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:09,049
accept one of our free tanks we will

00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:12,559
send volunteers to your house to fix it

00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:14,539
for free while you sleep who's ever gone

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,210
to fix people's computers their

00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:20,000
relatives probably stay away from my

00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:22,450
house you freak but can't you see that

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,309
everyone is buying station wagons um

00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:28,429
this is I think how people look at

00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:30,980
open-source really like have you ever

00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:32,559
tried to explain open-source to your

00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,549
grandmother or you know whoever

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,149
grandmother's the proverbial people to

00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:40,239
pick on our tastes terrible

00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:42,999
but it's true I think like and and the

00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:46,509
the bizarreness of open source as a

00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:48,729
system and as an example comes from the

00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:50,799
abundance of it the infinity of the

00:25:48,729 --> 00:25:52,419
resource and the giving of it away and

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,219
the community that will come to your

00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:55,570
house and fix it like what do you mean I

00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,549
don't pay you money in a normal

00:25:55,570 --> 00:26:00,849
transaction that I'm used to in every

00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:02,289
other aspect of my society can't you see

00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:04,839
everyone is buying station wagons or

00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:08,399
buying encyclopedias like I said before

00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:12,009
there's like the distrust around around

00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:14,320
Wikipedia stems from the things that

00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:15,789
make it open the same things that you

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,369
know make people think that the open

00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:19,599
source folks are freaks or everyone

00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:21,669
being monogamous because that's what

00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:26,099
everybody does you can't think of love

00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:28,269
any other way so bottom line i think is

00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:32,379
participating in open systems and open

00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:35,619
thinking is a radical act it's it breaks

00:26:32,379 --> 00:26:37,359
all the rules open systems are not part

00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:39,669
of the sharing economy we haven't won we

00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:41,559
haven't coalesced into some future

00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:43,330
that's going to last for 350 years like

00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:45,940
Mark was saying there's a lot of work to

00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:47,589
do to make that future possible truly

00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:50,759
open systems are rare and strange

00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:54,039
because true abundance is a rare thing

00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:56,580
but technology and other enabling

00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:59,229
factors can make open systems possible

00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:01,409
and when that happens they offer

00:26:59,229 --> 00:27:04,960
benefits you can't get any other way

00:27:01,409 --> 00:27:07,359
open source you know it is only possible

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,279
obviously with computer technology but

00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:12,820
it's also only possible with the

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:15,519
Internet I think at least on the scale

00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:19,419
that it happens at now at the scale

00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:21,339
necessary to meet marks vision of 350

00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:24,669
years of freedom you kind of need an

00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:26,589
Internet technology is important here

00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:28,119
and that's why I think the renewable

00:27:26,589 --> 00:27:30,460
energy example is instructive as well

00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:34,330
because if we solve the storage problem

00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:35,919
for electricity and if there was no not

00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:37,950
giant centrally controlled power

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:41,169
stations but lots more distributed

00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:44,259
generation of electricity could you have

00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:45,579
an open electricity system maybe but

00:27:44,259 --> 00:27:47,620
there's a lot of technological barriers

00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:51,400
in the way of that happening

00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:53,590
so that's a lot of philosophical ideas

00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,680
that's the end like I said the bottom

00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:58,360
line for me I hope I gave you some new

00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:02,350
ideas or some new perspectives on old

00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:17,160
ideas and welcome to have questions or

00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:17,160
discussion thank you thank you please

00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:35,559
all the sudden it was ordered the man to

00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:38,140
cheaper in the sanity I say all of a

00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:41,470
sudden but their respected yeah all the

00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:43,270
sudden certainly given the speed with

00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,830
which things happened at that point in

00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:46,600
history not all of a sudden by our

00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:48,490
standards but probably all of a sudden

00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,230
why there's that one we don't really

00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:58,450
remember that it was really important

00:28:50,230 --> 00:29:00,070
was inventing pay for me right right

00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:02,440
yeah movable-type gets all the attention

00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:05,440
but it's true the paper technology was

00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,660
an enabling the sugars was it right yeah

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:12,130
for that cast amazing can't think of

00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:15,300
that but then information became so much

00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:18,970
cheaper and easier to disseminate and

00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:22,330
change the world we just grew up in that

00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:24,370
room don't realize how dramatic probably

00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:31,030
bigger chains in the internet hmm

00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:34,140
interesting but it took set like carnac

00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:38,460
giving away libraries to

00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:41,580
cities in the world we have that

00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:45,710
happened around 1900 all these little

00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:45,710
steps near that didn't happen

00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:52,360
why don't we have everywhere right now

00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:58,010
and yes it's taken years and years

00:29:52,360 --> 00:30:02,060
anyway back to what I was trying to it's

00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:05,290
the first of all Delta's so the change

00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:08,770
in the cost of reproduction of things

00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:14,480
then look at look at what mass

00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:16,280
manufacturing one I think 3d printing is

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,370
going to accelerate that for certain

00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:22,130
kinds of fun things it may but I'm just

00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:24,050
saying simple reduction techniques of

00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:27,710
making cars it's nothing like that

00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:30,470
happened before and it's not just cars

00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:33,170
but it's bottles of everything else got

00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:35,750
everything we think of the amount of

00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:37,940
toys kids that now versus what they had

00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:42,530
a hundred years ago we live in a world

00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:46,220
of above so if there's a continuum of

00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:48,020
the cost of each copy and the cost of

00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:51,770
production are two different parts of

00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:54,200
the price and when when the information

00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:56,540
is free to replicate and I'd say the

00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,180
book was close to freakin fearful before

00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:03,790
convert to the cornea things change and

00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:03,790
they had to invent some technology

00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:14,120
copyright to try and harness them almost

00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:17,149
Reaper you going subsidize the creation

00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:20,629
yet look at the perversion of it

00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:22,999
create a monopoly and all sorts of

00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:27,909
problems are there too it's the same TV

00:31:22,999 --> 00:31:32,080
it's very expensive to buy a TV show and

00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:35,719
it's pretty elusive but we don't pay for

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:37,969
actually probably explosion of things on

00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:40,909
YouTube is interesting that one students

00:31:37,969 --> 00:31:43,759
the number of popular YouTube channels

00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:45,889
have more viewers than popular TV shows

00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:48,200
but the cost of production is very

00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:50,479
different I think there's a lot of

00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,690
you're right there's a lot of changes

00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:56,899
afoot in terms of the cost of producing

00:31:53,690 --> 00:32:04,580
everything we need a model that it's not

00:31:56,899 --> 00:32:08,719
parasites they don't seem to add very

00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:12,139
much doubt yeah so used to take the

00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:14,960
record label everything but if somebody

00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:17,960
does accumulate the power they may not

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:24,320
accumulate really great to harvest a

00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:28,309
creative a turkey I don't see sure well

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,779
I think there's and so I'm not sure how

00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:31,249
much that was picked up in the recording

00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:37,269
so just if I can briefly briefly

00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:40,219
summarize the discussions around the

00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:41,239
cost of different the changing costs of

00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:43,729
different methods of production of

00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:45,200
different items does it need to be truly

00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:46,759
abundant as it's not necessarily a

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:51,679
scarce versus abundant there's a

00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:53,869
spectrum there and how how might certain

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:57,049
things change over time moving towards

00:32:53,869 --> 00:32:59,599
this kind of all how how do we hardly

00:32:57,049 --> 00:33:02,839
make them open gradually it's not going

00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:04,519
to be a buyer switch that's a bastard

00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:08,419
summarization of where you're coming

00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:12,769
from I think yeah I think the movie

00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:15,639
example brings up shades of the Napster

00:33:12,769 --> 00:33:19,190
story because the legal framework around

00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:22,700
the resource there is creating a lot of

00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:23,549
barriers to avenal you know Creative

00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,759
Commons

00:33:23,549 --> 00:33:27,659
is to help with some of this stuff but

00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,249
so what's the world still revolves

00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:31,860
around money and always will I mean

00:33:29,249 --> 00:33:36,360
there's more paid contributors to linux

00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:41,279
and volunteers so you're always going to

00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:42,779
have to finance things somehow and the

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:46,789
people in charge of production are going

00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:50,220
to want to control that it's interesting

00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:51,980
some of what Mackay was saying about the

00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,869
way different organizations contribute

00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:58,200
you know perhaps in a very narrow way

00:33:54,869 --> 00:34:00,570
for their own self-interest versus just

00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,029
through I'm here I'll help however

00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:05,669
however I want that's not the default

00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:09,540
model for most organizations even with

00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:14,250
an open source systems I think one of

00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:19,520
the there's there's a few aspects if I

00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:19,520
go way back through the funny story

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:29,429
there needs to be I think some some way

00:34:26,309 --> 00:34:31,919
in which the resources abundant or at

00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:34,200
least not constrained not not under

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,000
somebody's control but I think the

00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:41,839
community is really important as well

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:44,790
because of open source as a movement

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:49,799
draws people in to be part of the

00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:52,710
community because they can be actors as

00:34:49,799 --> 00:34:55,139
well as receivers it's the old

00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:57,359
proverbial I have an itch to scratch so

00:34:55,139 --> 00:35:00,030
my you know when I when I think about

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:03,869
things like what about movies or what

00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:05,819
about other things I wonder what is the

00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:10,109
thing that would drive a community to

00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:12,660
participate in that 22 to support the

00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:16,579
use of that resource as a group and what

00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:19,000
are they getting out of doing that and

00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:21,850
entertainment is a funny example

00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,040
because to some extent where you Center

00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:26,740
tainment being passive like we receive

00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:59,970
it where is open source is a tool that

00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:59,970
we use so we have a lot more yeah yeah

00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:23,710
yeah it's durable very durable

00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:32,910
geographically constrained it takes a

00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:32,910
long dresses

00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,490
I

00:36:42,609 --> 00:37:01,420
yeah well I think thanks to our

00:36:56,019 --> 00:37:03,700
perspective differently it's certainly

00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,319
different than you know the internet is

00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,329
true i think if we look at the time

00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:08,829
scale florida time scale history the

00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:11,079
difference between like you were saying

00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:14,769
about books versus the internet is not

00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:16,420
as significant as like some previous

00:37:14,769 --> 00:37:18,609
jumps that may have happened in

00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,079
information technology I think there's

00:37:18,609 --> 00:37:22,539
some very interesting effects that

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,680
happen when the price approaches 0 so if

00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:26,230
you if you've read some of the

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,079
discussions i remember in two thousand

00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:32,440
people were writing a bit about the

00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:34,239
magic price point of free like the

00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,539
difference in people's behavior around

00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:40,299
resources when the incremental cost

00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:41,589
actually is zero or at least they

00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,940
perceive it as 0 because they don't

00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:45,480
receive a direct cost of that they're

00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:48,700
still paying for their isp etc but you

00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:50,859
know they're caught the cost of the no

00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,509
cost versus really small cost actually

00:37:50,859 --> 00:37:55,059
has a really big psychological on

00:37:52,509 --> 00:37:59,499
people's behavior in communities so i

00:37:55,059 --> 00:38:03,009
agree that the internet is not and the

00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:05,019
scale of how humans have worked with the

00:38:03,009 --> 00:38:07,539
resources they have isn't as significant

00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:09,849
as we may be think it is in comparison

00:38:07,539 --> 00:38:12,099
but i think it does have some really

00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:13,809
unique characteristics that no previous

00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:17,009
is happened that enables some of the

00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:17,009
kinds of sharing what we see now

00:38:22,260 --> 00:39:29,290
yeah for example yeah the community

00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:32,710
around it is not limited in what they

00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:34,600
can do this is why i think the like the

00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:38,440
GPL is the licensing mechanism is so

00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:40,120
important because like there's although

00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,270
there's all the sort of practical ethos

00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:45,340
around how open source happens with

00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:46,990
release early and often and you know how

00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:51,250
you attract and retain contributors and

00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:54,370
so on but the the licensing is really

00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:56,350
fundamental because it doesn't because

00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:58,660
it's what gives you the freedom you can

00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:02,670
choose to do whatever you want and

00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:06,010
there's lots of you know under GPL to

00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:07,540
web apps and weren't required to

00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:09,490
distribute any source code you could run

00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,800
your your web app on a server and it

00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,750
would

00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,570
be locked up even though you were using

00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:16,880
open source code so you could had lots

00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:19,820
of you can do whatever you want it but

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,010
the idea that you you as a user were

00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:24,920
free to make those changes is what's

00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:27,020
really important I think that that's you

00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,580
know when I think of the importance of

00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,500
the community being able to support the

00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:31,820
use of the resources that freedom is is

00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:36,350
one of the essential characteristics and

00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:39,170
it's missing in in cases where some

00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:44,060
control the locus of power like the app

00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:47,690
store or like the colossal distribution

00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:49,760
system for electricity there's there's

00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:51,920
the barriers in the way of our freedom

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,850
of access or use of this resource for

00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,720
one reason or another and that's I think

00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:59,930
one of the things that keeps it from

00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:03,440
being over there is just on the back and

00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:06,550
then we'll get back guests for things

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:12,560
where I strongly disagree with you is

00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:14,480
our baby a new girl okay okay that just

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,070
there's lots of breathless commentators

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,650
that would disagree on first i loves a

00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:22,340
bit of a straw man so I'm interested in

00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:26,210
how you demolish that look at me give

00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:27,350
people second message of a slide and if

00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:30,740
you look fragile for like linked by

00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:34,700
poder vivir people are looking on one

00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:37,369
side from rocket might add some movement

00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:41,079
from it and the other side just I can

00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:44,690
sleep with other cities for cheaper and

00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:50,200
behind this just minus 2 intersection

00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:53,180
where f both game 1-1 game just once a

00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:56,960
culturally from his browser to yeah

00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:58,490
because there is also a solution of

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,400
building something together it's not

00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:03,560
also building a relationship yes prob

00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,450
you perv something that as they've

00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:10,070
locked in North America it's like it's

00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:14,210
for calculating idea which is three from

00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:15,530
A to B I've got a slack off 360 just

00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:17,089
like to give them it just shows the

00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:21,079
customer thing to make money out of it

00:42:17,089 --> 00:42:23,510
and making back to of insurance and if

00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:25,400
you look for about how the apache server

00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:28,070
machine condition started in the height

00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,099
before in the same problem yes and

00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:34,700
getting together to build something and

00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:37,730
I think that's all about this I become

00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:41,390
an interest and realizing that work all

00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:45,460
together to improve it than competing

00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:47,690
against each other so to summarize

00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:49,339
there's a question whether her maybe

00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:51,490
Hoover are good examples of the sharing

00:42:49,339 --> 00:42:54,380
economy at all fair question

00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:57,730
couchsurfing and other car sharing

00:42:54,380 --> 00:43:01,160
services might be more appropriate and

00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:04,640
apache yes is a fantastic example I

00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:06,950
think of a fairly spontaneous community

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,109
developing actually the history of the

00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:12,109
Apache project is really fascinating and

00:43:09,109 --> 00:43:14,119
I think we go an awful lot to

00:43:12,109 --> 00:43:16,220
Microsoft's misunderstanding of the

00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:18,619
internet at that point in time because

00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:22,160
they went after the browser not the

00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:24,109
server imagine if they had done to the

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,200
server space what they did to the

00:43:24,109 --> 00:43:28,349
browser space

00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,390
that staple holy cow that would have

00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:32,040
been a very different internet but they

00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:34,670
went after the browser because it's what

00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:36,900
was threatening their desktop monopoly

00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:39,540
because the browser was a platform that

00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,010
you could run things in and you were no

00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:42,270
longer necessarily beholden to the

00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:44,849
desktop so that's what they went after

00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:47,070
meanwhile people who had a common

00:43:44,849 --> 00:43:49,740
interest in servers banded together and

00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:52,470
created Apache as we know it today and

00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:55,980
it was a small group of people who just

00:43:52,470 --> 00:44:01,410
did that in the most open source way

00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:03,690
possible and and they want Apache was

00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:08,099
the dominant is the dominant server on

00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:11,160
the internet and you know I is is just

00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:14,250
yeah you know why he's freaking if you

00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:17,160
can avoid so I think that that speaks I

00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:21,750
think to the importance of of the

00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:24,000
community like I think the abundance the

00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:25,680
the aspects of a resource that make it

00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,079
abundant reproach in abundance are a

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,329
fundamental enabling factor I don't know

00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,040
where the line is you have to hit truly

00:44:30,329 --> 00:44:34,260
zero cost or what cost you out to hit

00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,540
but there has to be some sense of

00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,829
abundance there has to be a lack of

00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:39,480
anybody fundamentally controlling the

00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:42,000
resource but there has to be the

00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:44,520
community that has that self-interest to

00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,220
band together and promote the use and

00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:52,349
empowerment of others in whatever this

00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:54,060
resource is and I this is maybe worth

00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:55,800
pointing out also that I think of

00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,810
community in this sense as a community /

00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:02,339
project not like the open source

00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:04,020
community writ large I think in the way

00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:06,119
I'm thinking about it here you know

00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:09,390
there's a community around patchy that

00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:12,180
that supports and empowers people in the

00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:14,760
use of that source code and there's a

00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:16,500
community around Firefox that does the

00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,420
same thing for that body of source code

00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,730
I'm not talking about the open source

00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,560
community versus the Wikipedia community

00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:24,140
as

00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:25,760
two communities there's lots of open

00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:27,260
source communities and it's a behavior

00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,750
of a particular open source community

00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:31,810
around kids particular source code that

00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:47,570
is that's what I'm talking about here

00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:50,510
one more yes well yeah hydroelectric

00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:51,830
power yeah but it's so centralized see

00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:54,700
what if we all had solar power to raise

00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:54,700
on all of our houses

00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:18,260
so just to summarize 21 bring comment

00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:22,850
about renewable energy that the cost may

00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:24,380
never ever go down to zero and you know

00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:26,090
in Germany there's a lot more renewable

00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:29,930
energy with our costs about up because

00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:34,850
the infrastructure involved so just one

00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:36,440
point to that I add the cost of

00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:39,560
producing open source software is not

00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:41,330
zero I it's an abundant resource but all

00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,100
the people at IBM to work on linux are

00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:46,610
paid a lot of money for their time and

00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:49,310
expertise to do that so open systems

00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:50,900
don't have to be free per se they can

00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:54,110
have very high costs involved some of

00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:57,020
those people are paid very handsome but

00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:58,850
you're right there's electricity is sort

00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:01,820
of my pet example because I wish it were

00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:05,750
the Kings I think there's it's a long

00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:08,180
way from being the case and the other

00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:10,640
thing if I can summarize you're talking

00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:14,660
about amazon and the long tail aspects

00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:16,370
of having so many books that are out of

00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:18,140
print but now are being possible to

00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:20,350
produce on a micro scale and the

00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:26,630
transaction costs being very low it

00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:28,820
enables that yes the only thing that

00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:31,850
comes to mind in response to add to that

00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:36,500
is one of the reasons I like the term

00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:39,230
abundance is it doesn't presuppose where

00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:40,250
the abundance happens it could be in the

00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:41,720
production costs could be in the

00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,200
transaction costs it could be just in

00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,730
the problem

00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,560
sort of the accessibility of the

00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:48,170
resource or whatever it is Travis me

00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:51,260
some abundant aspect I think the issue

00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:52,970
one of the challenges with the example

00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:55,849
of Amazonas books is of course it's all

00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:57,920
controlled by amazon oh you know like if

00:48:55,849 --> 00:49:00,440
we had like say Wikipedia in charge of

00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,240
that instead of Amazon like would that

00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,740
get us closer to open and it brings us

00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,210
back the questions at the locus of power

00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:08,599
who's in who's actually in control of

00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:10,160
this I think that becomes then a

00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:13,849
financial barrier to the community

00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:19,940
aspect of a truly open system yes you've

00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:23,420
been very patient this is a wonderful

00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:25,070
discussion and there is a venue for

00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:28,430
taking this discussion for their

00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:31,010
interview in the reception room that can

00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:34,280
be lubricated with either soft drinks or

00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:36,680
beer or wine so I invite you to take

00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:39,260
your questions and continue this or an

00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:43,329
eye in the place where you had lunch

00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:43,329
