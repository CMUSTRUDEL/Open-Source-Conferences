all right good afternoon how is everyone

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:12,840
oh okay enthusiastic so like he said re

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,809
at CDOT right now I just graduated I've

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,470
been working here for just over two

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:22,199
years and this is my third episode and

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,269
my second time presenting at em sauce my

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:29,010
very first time presenting here was a

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:32,550
bit awkward because our title for the

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:35,280
presentation was bit bag and turns out

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:39,989
long story short the audience was much

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,160
more guru like than I thought so they

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:42,780
knew a lot more than i did when i was

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,129
talking which is kind of weird so

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,020
hopefully this time i'm going to get it

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:47,670
right and i just want to let you know

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,039
what this presentation is going to be

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,230
about it's not going to be a slideshow

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,969
like you've probably seen all throughout

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,030
f sauce it's going to be more of an

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,520
interactive demo what i want to do is

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,100
show you some quickly some basic

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,299
commands in Linux but also get into more

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,590
advanced details and hopefully depending

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,310
on your skill level you'll be able to

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,140
learn something new but just by the show

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,400
of hands I want to know what your skill

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,770
level is here how many people are

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,840
familiar with the bash shell or use

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,820
linux frequently there anyone who

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,909
doesn't and like its brand new don't be

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,430
shy okay great so i will be giving you

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,710
some quick starter tips but i won't

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,939
spend too much time on it and if you

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,750
feel like you already know this stuff

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:39,930
are just not interested feel free to

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,950
leave or stay it's up to you what I'm

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:46,619
going to be going over is basically just

00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:49,350
the basics with certain options you can

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,200
use with LS maker just for a few minutes

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:55,860
then I'm going to get into SS aging how

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,930
to use grep sad och and terminate

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,329
terminal emulators such as team ox and

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,799
screen and how to use them efficiently

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,290
and what you can use them for if you

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,450
don't already know I'm also going to do

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,960
an in-depth review of a lot of review

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:14,610
but a more a detailed usage of BIM and

00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:16,620
is them proficiently or bi or by however

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:20,120
you want to pronounce it I know some

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:23,790
people are picky about that Justin know

00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,430
whatever you want to call it okay and if

00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:28,200
we have more time at the end of this

00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:31,830
interactive demo we will do some more

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,590
complex details mainly using DD commands

00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,300
and mounting partitions and doing really

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:40,110
cool stuff that maybe you've never done

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,910
before so yeah starting off with the

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,470
basics these are the commands that

00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,880
you're going to be doing most of the

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:49,230
time I'm sure most of you know what the

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:51,660
LS command does but just before i get

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,400
into that one thing you should probably

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:57,270
know is whenever you're typing out

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,520
commands or files or directories you can

00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,920
easily tab these things out and that

00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,380
will help you complete the process much

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,500
faster like say for example I want to

00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,270
use the command k part x oh just do KP

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,800
and tap that out pressing the tab button

00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,390
so much faster than typing the whole

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,970
thing yell because you leave out the

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,290
chance of you know causing an error you

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,730
know piping the wrong thing and then

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,010
you're going to spend the longest time

00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:24,720
trying to figure it out I've seen people

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:28,170
trying to show the directory all the way

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,580
down to like I don't know a really

00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,680
really long directory and they type the

00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,870
whole thing out this is a big pet peeve

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,100
of mine just have it out it's so much

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:40,410
easier and it saves so much time and

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,940
another thing if you have I don't know

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,800
if you're curious about what a command

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,660
does or are you just completely lost on

00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,900
how to use it you could use the man

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:52,460
command because most Linux applications

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:55,710
they have man pages which show you the

00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:57,780
more in-depth tutorial or guide on how

00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:00,210
to use the application so say for

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,000
example I use the man pages of K

00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:04,350
products you can see that I have all the

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,770
options here and they tells me about

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:11,640
they do and how some examples of how to

00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,990
use them with some other information you

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,739
might not care about like the authors

00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:19,950
but it's there for you if you want to do

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:22,560
a quicker search for help you can always

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,910
do dash h or dash dash help which is

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,010
usually available on all

00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,230
linux commands but sometimes they're not

00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,610
and sometimes you'll have to use one or

00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:32,250
the other and it's kind of annoying

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,950
because H is not there or dash dash help

00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,510
is out there well usually at least if

00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,750
one of them's there then you're fine

00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:42,180
you're not too far off yeah so what

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,910
start off with LS LS is just a simple

00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,490
listing of your directories and files in

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,560
your current working directory many of

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,180
you probably know that already if you're

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,360
using if you use the windows and CMD

00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,570
this is just like or similar to derp a

00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,030
derp command some options you might want

00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:02,940
to use with LS is dash 8 this will show

00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:06,960
you all your viewer hidden files dash h

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:10,290
which will show you the well using dash

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,350
LH because i need to show something else

00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:15,300
dash h just shows you the long listing

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:18,660
of your directories and files which will

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:21,690
give you the human readable size of

00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,730
these files if you don't it's going to

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,700
give you the bytes and if this is a

00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:28,880
really large file like say 20 gigs it's

00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:33,180
not going to be very easy to realize

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,200
that's pretty common to know but when

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,380
you're typing out you might have noticed

00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:41,130
that there are some shortcuts in most

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:45,990
modern operating systems ll is alias two

00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:48,360
LS dash L which I find it's a small fix

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,400
to make it a bit faster but typing ll is

00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:54,600
much faster than typing LS dash l or

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,820
just LS and I find ellos much more nice

00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,740
it's very ordered and lines up for you

00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:02,220
gives you more information than you

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,010
might need but that's ok and if you're

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,510
on if you're coming from a taboo to side

00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:08,970
open to also has the L command which is

00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:11,490
a shorter version of LS not exactly sure

00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:14,160
what it does as well if you don't

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,350
already know when you're writing

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,910
commands you can combine options without

00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:25,230
having to separate them like LS or LLS

00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:27,330
aah or D that the D command the option

00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,770
just tells you the details of the

00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,410
directory without actually listing the

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,669
contents of the directory that's useful

00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,710
if you ever need to find out the

00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:37,370
permissions of a directory and you can't

00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:42,110
necessarily find it right away

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:46,530
useful to know but I'll skip over that

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:49,860
so if you might have seen my ps1 line

00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,720
right here this is a bit more complex

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:56,640
than the traditional one I don't think I

00:06:51,720 --> 00:07:00,540
have well here's a example of the

00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:04,290
original ps1 so it's just a simple line

00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:08,250
with rude at my local host name and a

00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:10,440
squiggly line you can customize your ps1

00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:14,460
just by going into the bash RC file or

00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,870
bash profile and mine's just here I

00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,700
found this on reddit I thought it was

00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,740
pretty cool and it's nice to have

00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,660
everything on a separate line at the

00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:26,180
bottom because when you get into large

00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:31,860
directories like usershare I don't know

00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:33,780
applications and you keep going well if

00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,490
if it gets really long it's going to get

00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,750
pretty crowded so it's nice to have that

00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,370
on a separate line so that when you're

00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:42,530
typing out commands they don't really

00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:44,970
get in the way so that's pretty useful

00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,590
if you don't already know the present

00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:50,190
working directory command gives you the

00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:51,600
listing of your current directory if it

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,450
doesn't show you on the top and you need

00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,250
to figure it out right away to create

00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:59,790
directories you just use mcdeere command

00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:03,180
and if you want to create sub

00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:05,610
directories that are non-existent or say

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,860
for example i want to make a test with

00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,660
the directory be with a nested directory

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,500
be that's not going to work because you

00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,550
need to use the dash p for parent

00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,290
directory i think that's what it stands

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:21,570
for yeah so that's going to create both

00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:23,520
a and B for me pretty simple so arm der

00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,590
I'm just going to get rid of this this

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,960
is not going to work because the

00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:30,200
director is not empty right the fastest

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,089
way to do this is using our M dash RF

00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:36,630
but i'll go into why that's kind of a

00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:39,419
risky maneuver so let me get to that

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:43,440
right now let's say I want to move a

00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:44,710
file or copy a file I have a file its

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:50,190
going to documents

00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:52,840
eps sauce okay so I'm going to move or

00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,940
rather if you want to move a file i just

00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,890
use MV it's pretty straightforward move

00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,780
och and then you choose the directory

00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:01,120
you want to put it in whatever if you

00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:04,030
wanna use the copy command UCP instead

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,310
of copy if you're from CMD or PowerShell

00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:07,450
you get really really confused when

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,790
you're switching from them to the other

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:13,900
because one in Windows it's straight out

00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:15,220
just copy or move or rename and I've

00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,930
seen a lot of people to use the rename

00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,350
command on linux and that's not a real

00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:24,070
thing is just move so yeah if you're

00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:26,800
copying a bunch of files that are nested

00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:32,590
inside a directory you can use the dash

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:34,480
are copied a chart you might want to use

00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:38,560
the capital R I don't think there's a

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,900
difference now but copy dash capital R

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,850
might have I think copies over some kind

00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,740
of flag information or it might have

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,570
been something that were used in older

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,010
versions of bash right now I don't think

00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:50,530
it matters anymore but i always use

00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:52,390
capital R and you choose the directory

00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:54,880
you want to copy over and the

00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:58,750
destination now this is going to ask me

00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,700
to depending on what I'm doing with

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,460
whichever permissions the directories

00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:06,310
have it might ask me to overwrite some

00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,750
files and if I want to do that it's

00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:10,330
going to ask me for every file I want to

00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,670
overwrite and if my directory has say a

00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:15,520
thousand files I don't want to be

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,600
clicking yes for a thousand times over

00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,740
and over again that's kind of annoying

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,980
so you could use the dash F option to

00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,840
force it and that'll just pretty much

00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:29,610
activate the quiet mode as in with

00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:33,100
Windows but this is very very unsafe and

00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:35,800
i'll tell you why when i'm using the RM

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,210
command which is very similar so far M

00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,250
is the leading files instead of copying

00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:42,130
them but you have the same options there

00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,720
that are available are M dash RF now RM

00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:46,420
is just to delete a single file if

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,880
you're deleting a directory with sub

00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,410
directories or sub files then you

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,690
probably want to use the recursive one

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:55,090
with a chef if you're not going to use

00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,780
it with dash f it's going to ask you for

00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:59,480
every file you want to delete kind of

00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:02,300
but if used a chef you got to be very

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,120
very careful because if you're deleting

00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:07,400
something on Linux most of the time

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,930
you're deleting it forever you have

00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,500
pretty much no chance of getting it back

00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:14,210
unless you know data recovery which you

00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,940
have a chance of getting it back but it

00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:18,230
is still not a hundred percent and it

00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:22,160
depends on how long it takes you to

00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:24,790
figure out that you made a mistake so

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,520
yeah be careful with that there's also

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:32,660
some people have tried doing this this

00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:34,460
is a very risky command but so for those

00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,440
of you who don't know the root directory

00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,930
has pretty much everything in your file

00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,370
system it's depending on if you have

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,550
multiple partitions if it's just one

00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:45,230
root directory then everything that

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:47,960
includes your applications your your

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:51,040
home files it's going to be gone but

00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:54,920
thanks to innovations that well

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:58,040
innovations that figured out this was a

00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,590
big issue there's now a safety procedure

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,440
that tells you oh this is a dangerous

00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:06,560
operation yeah because you know some of

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,780
us just want to have some fun right but

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,920
yeah don't do that even even for fun

00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,740
because you never know you might be on a

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,650
really old linux machine and this might

00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:18,710
not be implemented and you do a pseudo

00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:20,540
force delete your boss is gonna be mad

00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:24,830
at you in the morning so you know don't

00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:27,770
do that okay so that's a little bit of a

00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:30,320
basics change directory I'm sure you

00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:32,390
most of you know this ready I'm changing

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,510
directories all the time change

00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:39,320
directory to go to a parent directory

00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:40,700
use two dots one dot just tells you it's

00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,910
the current directory and usually see

00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,590
that a lot of times no not here oh there

00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,960
you go that's at the top right there so

00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:51,050
two dots parent directory one current

00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,540
directory if I want to another cool

00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:57,950
trick I learned with CD is you can

00:12:53,540 --> 00:13:03,550
actually go into a really really far

00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:03,550
directory say wow it's big one

00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:13,760
awk let's try that's not that far

00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:15,560
ok so awk is here and I want to go its

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,950
route and let's say I don't want to type

00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:22,250
out change directory user share awk all

00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:25,070
the time that's kind of slow I can just

00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,540
do change directory dash I didn't even

00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,310
know this was available until like a few

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,840
weeks ago when a co-worker mentioned it

00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:32,240
to me and this brings you back to the

00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,580
previous directory you're in and this

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,970
happens back and forth right so if

00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:39,470
you're working on a directory that or

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,460
maybe two directories specifically that

00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,750
you need to work in and you don't

00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,400
necessarily want to open a second

00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:46,970
terminal this can help you out a little

00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:49,040
bit but not not completely what if you

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,230
want to work in say five or more

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,430
directories and you want to keep track

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,850
of which directories you're working in

00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:58,520
well you can do this by using the push D

00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:01,880
command and the push D command works

00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:04,370
like a just stack and for those of you

00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:09,200
who don't remember what a stack is think

00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:12,050
of your at your at mandarin right I know

00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,000
what the turbo restaurant but you know

00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:17,300
when you go to the buffet and you've got

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,980
the stack of plates when the person

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,050
stacks the place the first one goes in

00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,600
the next one goes in the spring goes

00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:26,090
down lower and lower and then now your

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,340
first plate is unreachable only the top

00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:31,040
one is so it's a first in last out sort

00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,960
of notation so when I push in the

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,810
current directory right now I pushed in

00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:40,300
the route you can see now that the root

00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:43,130
is added I'm going to now change to my

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,840
slash home directory and I want to put

00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:48,260
home in there as well so i'm going to

00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:50,420
put home ok now home is in my stack as

00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:55,850
well i'll do the same thing for a few

00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:58,040
more and you'll see that the stack keeps

00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,180
growing and growing you don't

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,980
necessarily have to change it to the

00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:10,320
directory to add it you can always just

00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:14,130
add the name just like that look well

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,110
now that I have my stack it's about two

00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:19,020
directories large you can list them by

00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:21,870
just doing the ders command and as you

00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:25,530
can see i have root in my stack that's

00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:27,780
the first one satchel and then my home

00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:30,080
directory followed by documents it looks

00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:33,900
like my home to our crew there twice but

00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:37,410
anyway so to use this command or to use

00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:41,130
this stack I will change into an example

00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:44,520
here I'm in / user now I want to go back

00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:46,770
and use the latest plate in my stack and

00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,840
I'll just do a pop d and it'll

00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:50,910
automatically send me to the last played

00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:54,060
in my stack I am now in the home

00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:57,140
directory pop T again now i'm in the

00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:59,610
root directory no home directory sorry

00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:02,940
and now i'm in the root directory and i

00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:05,670
think that's about it now there we go

00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,530
the stack is now empty so that's a nice

00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,330
useful command I don't know if a lot of

00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:11,010
you have ever heard of it I only learned

00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:13,170
about it recently and I found it pretty

00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:16,130
useful in case you're ever working on

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:18,360
multiple directories and stuff like that

00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,610
but if you don't really care about that

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,040
that's okay we'll get into more

00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:26,150
complicated stuff very soon so let's say

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,530
for example I need to find a file that I

00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:30,480
don't necessarily know the name to buy

00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,790
know what it starts with you can use

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,730
there's two methods there's the first

00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:38,400
one is the find command now the find

00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,690
command has a very strange syntax which

00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:44,610
took me a really long time to figure it

00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:45,750
out but after some time I kind of picked

00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:48,810
it up because it's very useful you're

00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:52,610
going to use it pretty often and let's

00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:56,010
say I'm in my documents folder I'll go

00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:58,560
so I want to find the readme file that's

00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:00,570
in my app sauce directory I'm going to

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,830
specify find and then directly i'm going

00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:04,530
to be looking in it's the f sauce

00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:07,230
presentation folder and i want to

00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:10,010
specify the name of the file and i know

00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:12,360
the name starts with read me in all caps

00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,860
but i don't necessarily know the file

00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,350
extension to it so i'm just going to put

00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,699
an asterisk that's just a wild card for

00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:20,630
those of you who don't know you can use

00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:22,490
wildcards to sort of

00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:25,130
abstract the information that you don't

00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:28,550
necessarily know so asterisks just

00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:32,120
refers to well at least in the bosch

00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:34,490
sense it refers to anything like zero or

00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,470
more you're nothing but nothing or

00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,420
something that comes after read me and

00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,340
I'm looking for anything that starts

00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:43,040
with r eb and ends with whatever either

00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:45,110
something or nothing so I found it

00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,100
there's a readme file it's not md if I

00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:49,760
didn't know any better it would probably

00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:52,130
be txt or something like that so the

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,650
fine command is pretty useful but it's

00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:57,050
not necessarily very fast if you're in

00:17:54,650 --> 00:18:00,260
the root directory and you have a file

00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:02,210
system that's like 500k large and you're

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,970
looking for a file that you have no idea

00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,970
where it is this could take like hours

00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:09,800
if not days to find the file because

00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:11,960
honestly it's just it's going through

00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,120
each and every directory looking for a

00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,670
file and it depending on how fast your

00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,710
hard drive or SD is even if you're on an

00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:21,680
SSD if it'd still be very very slow so

00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:24,760
let's give that a try and if this works

00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:28,430
really fast I'm sorry for lying to you

00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:31,550
let's say I'm going to look for I don't

00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:36,110
know what's a good file name follow me

00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:37,850
okay and you also got to forget don't

00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:40,120
forget to use the pseudo if you're

00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:43,340
looking for a file that's possibly any

00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:47,720
route protected directory use sudo if

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:50,600
it's not then don't and we'll see how

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,820
long this takes so let's keep it going

00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:56,620
it's finding files but not necessarily

00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:59,900
the one I want wow that was really fast

00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,790
okay so that's a bad example but I did

00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:06,080
just install the system so there's

00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:07,280
probably 60 x 7 gets used up generally

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,040
if you're in like a work space

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,040
environment and you got like huge

00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:14,330
virtual machines and large data sets

00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,340
it's going to take a really really long

00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:19,120
time what you can do to speed up the

00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:21,110
process though is use the locate command

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,420
if you don't already know what the low

00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:26,270
key command is this is amazing it's so

00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:29,030
useful the low key command is just using

00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:32,420
indexing to find files using the index

00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:34,100
location now let's say for example I

00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:36,500
want to find the readme file

00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,450
I can just use locate and it found a

00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,750
bunch of readme files so fast look how

00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:43,610
much faster that was compared to find

00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,530
now this doesn't always work because

00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,270
just because you have a file on your

00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:49,730
file system doesn't necessarily mean you

00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:52,669
have it indexed for your hard drive or

00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:55,760
SSD what you can do though is to update

00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:58,520
the database and you need sit over

00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,980
access for that a big TV just updates

00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,900
the records with all the latest files

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,280
into your index and then you can locate

00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:14,330
again you probably find more results

00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:22,549
than I did last time so yeah sure really

00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:27,080
Yeah right okay I never noticed that

00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:29,179
that's okay so on and if you ever feel

00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,700
like you know there's a bottle their

00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:33,409
prime reading about the EV probably

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,990
won't take too long lets you have a

00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:37,390
really really old hard drive and you

00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:43,309
probably just need all four you're here

00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:45,140
but yeah so those are the locating

00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:50,150
commands but what's going to do some

00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:52,940
more interesting cause now so SSH I'm

00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:54,890
sure most of you know what SSH is if

00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:58,070
you're at least a student here or you've

00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:00,919
used linux before if you don't SSH is

00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:04,159
the secure socket shell or secure shell

00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:07,370
wherever you want to say it basically

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,470
lets you to connect to any remote

00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:12,890
computer over the network using probably

00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:15,350
land or even how this probably possible

00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:16,730
of using some other medium but we

00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:20,690
usually just use it for land and let's

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:24,679
see if I can connect to Senecas network

00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:33,500
which is famous for being so so stable

00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:35,970
and fast okay come on

00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,400
this is usually very slow we have a

00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:41,850
network switch over going on or we'll

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,680
already complete it but we're still

00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:50,490
having some issues with ssh into our

00:21:43,680 --> 00:22:03,300
work machines at CDOT so i have a ssh

00:21:50,490 --> 00:22:06,360
key thing okay yeah that's my username

00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:15,440
for four matrix they didn't let me

00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:17,940
change it well it's not working now I

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,800
have no idea what's wrong with that but

00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:24,900
I have another computer thanks to

00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:28,760
Michael here i'm going to ssh into his

00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:39,600
computer but that's a lot easier I find

00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:42,240
yeah internal you guys yes okay now even

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,920
though this computer is like very close

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,710
to this location it still takes a really

00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:50,820
long time I find it's faster just

00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:54,780
connect them home but so this is Isis

00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:57,900
aging I'll also show you some other cool

00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:00,960
tricks or well some things you should be

00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:03,030
doing when you're hosting an ssh server

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,660
on your local machine what you want to

00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:16,440
make sure is one really important thing

00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:18,630
that ssh permit rubra one thing you want

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:22,200
to do is make sure that your root login

00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:23,910
/ ssh is disabled and ideally just don't

00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,460
have a root account like just to sit

00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:32,130
able to password because we recently had

00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:35,400
attacks not recently constantly have

00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:38,880
attacks at CDOT and these are coming

00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,630
from places in China Russia there's

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,370
spanning us with login attempts and

00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:45,840
mainly the guests the root password is

00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:48,870
brute forcing random

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,520
sports that might work so you want to

00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:54,690
prevent them from getting access to it

00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:57,000
our least trying to they might try some

00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:59,490
user names but if your user name is not

00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,480
like super typical like user name John

00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:06,570
or what have you they won't be able to

00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,460
guess hit that easily so better better

00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:12,720
be safe and just disable the root

00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:14,940
password or the root login for ssh but

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,559
another thing you want to do is instead

00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,750
of just using a password login process

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,090
SH you want to use a key like I'm using

00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:24,450
here but it's not well I just working I

00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:26,909
hope Wow there we go so what I did there

00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:31,020
was not a not just a password login it

00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:34,169
was a ssh key that is passphrase

00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:38,419
protected and to do that you can create

00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:40,860
your ssh key using the ssh key gen

00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:44,309
command by default this is going to

00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:45,630
create an RSA key I already have this

00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:54,890
file so I'm going to name it something

00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:57,390
else I ec2 and so a lot of people get

00:24:54,890 --> 00:25:00,809
lazy when it comes to entering a

00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:04,169
password now I used to be lazy myself

00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:06,330
but after a while I got convinced that

00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,760
you know it's really worth it might as

00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:11,000
well just put in the password because

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,960
you can have it so that your legs system

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,970
automatically unlocks it the first time

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,730
you type in your password and so

00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:19,380
whenever you want to really log in it

00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:20,760
won't ask you though just say oh it's or

00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,429
your kids are already unlocked that's

00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,559
fine just go right under but as soon as

00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:26,940
you turn off your laptop and reboot it

00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,980
and you're gonna have to enter it again

00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,230
so if anyone gets access to your private

00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,539
key they still can't get in without

00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,370
knowing your password and vice versa if

00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:37,559
they know your password they still need

00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:40,620
your key which probably hopefully is

00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:42,779
hard to find or you don't have it like

00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:46,789
on a USB key that anyone can steal from

00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:46,789
your bank don't steal my bag please

00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:55,560
so yeah that's that's a pretty important

00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:58,260
thing one more thing with ssh though if

00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:00,360
you want to do some graphical stuff but

00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:02,760
you can only do it remotely on a

00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:05,040
computer that's not at home and you

00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:10,110
don't have access to it physically you

00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:15,810
can use the dash X see options X stands

00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:19,890
for x 11 x forwarding rather x11 is like

00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:23,910
the standard / today for linux windows

00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:25,050
managing systems they I don't know how

00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:27,210
to relate that to windows or anything

00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:32,220
else but it's what it handles all the

00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:35,540
windows in your your desktop and let's

00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:49,230
give that a try so what I can do here is

00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:53,520
wrong what is that right that is my

00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:56,400
engineer it's there should be it should

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,380
be the same one I don't know so and the

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,050
dash the option is just to compress the

00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:03,600
data because if you're sending over x 11

00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:04,950
packets that's a lot of data and you

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,680
probably want to make it fast because if

00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:10,080
you're probably working from home can I

00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,790
came to school or something that might

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,650
be really slow I've had to do that

00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:17,660
before and using Firefox over in the

00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:19,320
network can be a pain in the butt

00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:22,550
depending on what you're doing though

00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:26,190
and we're behind a NAT right now so I

00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:28,230
hope this works come on work before I'm

00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:30,840
ready in here but I don't have the X

00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:38,130
forwarding looking yet so let's try

00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:40,380
again oh never mind there we go okay now

00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:45,060
i'm in korea i'm just going to close

00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:46,770
this yeah by the way are a our computer

00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:49,520
names are based off of countries that we

00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:53,520
ran and we choose this computer's korea

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,840
mine is Greenland I've also worked on

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,300
Canada

00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:02,070
and Romania they're all pretty great but

00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:05,690
it's kind of hilarious because yeah it's

00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:08,280
funny it's an inside joke yet but

00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:12,150
whenever we're discussing different

00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:14,250
computer names and people think Oh is

00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:17,130
there like a war going on like Iraq is

00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:20,820
down like or a rack is on fire what's

00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:24,780
going on so we got to keep quiet about

00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:26,460
that sometimes when visitors come by so

00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:29,760
what's let's try running fire huh

00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:31,790
Firefox is a bit heavy let's try excise

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:37,830
this is one of my favorite applications

00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:40,380
cool ok so now oops I'm running excise

00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:42,030
over the network I probably have this

00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,180
installed locally but it's not running

00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:47,850
locally this is running all on Korea and

00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:49,920
that's pretty great I mean it's pretty

00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:52,110
fast right now which is pretty cool but

00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:56,580
say for example I try using firefox

00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:58,080
you're going to notice a bit of lag I my

00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:03,110
name I'm not probably won't boot up

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,110
right away but that makes some sense

00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:10,590
yeah so when I 10 is using this for

00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:13,350
connecting to are they private networks

00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:15,090
on at CDOT we have a cabinet that you

00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:17,010
probably notice at the front and we

00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:19,080
can't necessarily just access it via our

00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:20,820
web browser because we got to get into

00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,460
the internal network first and then we

00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:26,250
can access it so you can see kind of

00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:27,840
loaded it's actually pretty fast it's

00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,000
not that much like if you were working

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,490
far away a few kilometers away you

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,930
probably notice some lag and if you try

00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:37,050
to scroll you probably wouldn't be able

00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:39,690
to scroll right away but this is working

00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:41,730
really well right now so that's probably

00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:43,770
something that is useful too many of you

00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:46,380
but maybe you've never heard of it

00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:53,250
before so yeah dash X see that's the

00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:59,420
command ok just log out next I want to

00:29:53,250 --> 00:30:01,800
talk about using the grep commands oops

00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:03,240
yeah Seneca won't let me disconnect now

00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,679
I don't know there's something wrong

00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:12,360
with your computer

00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:14,909
okay there we go great so the grep

00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,499
command is a very very fast it's the

00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:18,869
fastest of the next few command I'm

00:30:16,499 --> 00:30:23,429
talking about grep set a knock grep lets

00:30:18,869 --> 00:30:24,419
you find information it reads data but

00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:27,149
it doesn't necessarily let you

00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:33,119
manipulate data so some of the things

00:30:27,149 --> 00:30:36,749
you can do with grep is I guess you

00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:39,450
could use let's say I want to look for

00:30:36,749 --> 00:30:48,149
the line happy birthday so I have a file

00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:49,710
on here that specifies there's a grep

00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:51,990
file in here don't look at confuse the

00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:53,759
first one is the command and I'm looking

00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:55,409
for the line happy birthday I've got to

00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,139
put quotes around here because it's not

00:30:55,409 --> 00:30:59,909
going to work if there's a space and it

00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:01,379
should find happy birthday it's not my

00:30:59,909 --> 00:31:06,629
birthday by the way so don't don't sing

00:31:01,379 --> 00:31:09,570
me a song and I have a two versions of

00:31:06,629 --> 00:31:11,789
this text actually I have the first

00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:13,139
version and the second version now

00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:15,809
notice this one didn't get picked up

00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:19,230
because of the capital B so you can

00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:22,080
easily disable case sensitive searching

00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:25,860
or graphing using dash I and so if i do

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,119
that with the previous command you'll

00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,330
see i'll get all the results for happy

00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:33,179
birthday now some other cool tricks with

00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:36,299
grep is using the capital A or capital e

00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:41,009
capital a I actually just learned about

00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:43,980
this to these let you display the lines

00:31:41,009 --> 00:31:46,470
that come after or before your match

00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:49,409
which is pretty useful like so you're

00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:51,090
looking for a class definition and you

00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:54,659
want you know the title or the prototype

00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:58,139
of that function like def my class

00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:59,429
brackets your arguments but you also

00:31:58,139 --> 00:32:01,740
want to look at the contents of that

00:31:59,429 --> 00:32:04,559
then you can use the dash a and say oh

00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:07,559
probably add an extra twenty lines to

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:09,990
that to show the rest so in the happy

00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:14,519
birthday each happy birthday lyrics has

00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:18,030
four lines so i'll do a poor and also

00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:23,410
put the dash I option to remove case

00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:29,020
sensitivity oh right Iran oops I forgot

00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:35,620
thorough search Cathy so we can do this

00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:43,330
however I want should still work all

00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:44,470
right so that's how you use grep the

00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:49,780
next thing I want to talk to you about

00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:53,410
is said now if any of you have used said

00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:56,110
you will know that kind of insane to use

00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:59,080
it's like got to know like all the back

00:32:56,110 --> 00:33:01,990
Sasha's forward slashes and all the ugly

00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,220
wild card things you got to use I'm not

00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:06,700
going to get into too much detail about

00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:08,650
the advanced set commands but go over

00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:12,310
how to use it at least proficiently

00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:15,550
enough so I have a file in here as well

00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:17,110
called said and I've got a few lines in

00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:19,150
here I first thing I want to try is

00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:22,210
change that first line to did it work

00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:27,760
false to did it work true so how do we

00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:30,130
do that let's said we can do a replace

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:33,520
using starting with s and inside our

00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:36,190
first pair of slashes these are just the

00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:38,950
delimiter for your replace or your find

00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:43,000
on your replace matches the first rack

00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:49,840
the first two lines I'll put in what was

00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:54,610
it something did it work right wait did

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,920
it work ok so said you guys can all see

00:33:54,610 --> 00:34:00,160
that right it's the font big enough it's

00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:03,160
great ok so you have to start with /

00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:04,480
with the s that means replace there are

00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,010
other options and said I don't

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:14,710
necessarily use them all I usually just

00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:21,210
use this one did it work and false and I

00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:25,360
want to replace that with the work true

00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:28,350
ok and that should work ok as you can

00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:30,880
see it's now saying true at the top and

00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:31,480
this doesn't necessarily change the file

00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,609
this

00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,290
is just showing you the output when you

00:34:33,609 --> 00:34:36,909
run the set command and how it's going

00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:38,710
to change the file if you actually want

00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:41,350
to change the file you have to specify

00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:44,350
the dash I option which will modify it

00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:46,290
and now if I go into Orphic at the set

00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:49,270
file you'll see that it is now changed

00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:51,899
now next thing I want to do is change my

00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:54,250
salary I want to give myself a bonus so

00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:56,590
to do that we can probably do it the

00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:58,410
same way we did it last time but let's

00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:00,850
say I don't necessarily know how much

00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:03,490
money I'm making right now but say I

00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:09,970
it's just a random number so I can do

00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:12,340
this using dash I of course as for

00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:14,619
replacing and then again i'm going to

00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:15,880
put in my name or you know what I don't

00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:20,440
even have to put the entire line I can

00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:22,869
just put salary and start from there now

00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,240
let's say I don't know what 40,000 is

00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:26,770
let's say I just know it's a number but

00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:31,380
I don't know how long it is or what

00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:37,030
number it is exactly so i can use this

00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:40,750
wild card along with this one what this

00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:44,920
does is it's going to first look for any

00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:46,840
digit 0 to 9 that's any digit and if

00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,910
there's zero or more occurrence of

00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,680
occurrences of it if i want to use one

00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:52,270
or more occurrences of it meaning i know

00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:56,260
that there's at least one I would use

00:35:52,270 --> 00:36:01,720
plus instead of asterisk and now I just

00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:05,020
want to change that to this how much

00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:11,200
should I give myself I want a lot of

00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:14,230
money but let's give myself a million

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,810
dollars is that a good enough yeah that

00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:20,590
seems good enough okay so now that

00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:25,540
should have worked yes okay great I got

00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:27,970
a bonus so you see now that there's a

00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:32,320
bit of garbage here I want to get rid of

00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:34,750
this extra line of garbage to do that

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,180
I'm going to use the previous man with a

00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:40,290
bit more additions to it I'm going to

00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:42,490
enable the extended sad commands or

00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:44,990
regular expression support I guess

00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:46,970
that's what it's called but

00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:51,860
I want to get rid of anything that

00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:54,500
starts with spaces and ends with some

00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:56,630
numbers to do that I'm going to start

00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,550
with the carrot character the carrot

00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:01,280
just specifies that this is the

00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:04,670
beginning of the line and now I'm

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:07,880
followed that by a space with an

00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:10,160
asterisk the asterisk just means that

00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,020
the there were going to be zero or more

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:16,430
spaces so anything that comes before the

00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:19,369
asterisk is your the subject of the wild

00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:23,090
card I guess and anything that comes

00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:26,480
after these spaces that follows with

00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:28,850
some numbers and we know it's at least

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,760
one number so we use plus instead of

00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:33,080
asterisk replace it with nothing now by

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,720
default this is only going to replace

00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:38,420
the first one and delete it we want to

00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:41,300
delete all them so use G at the end G

00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:43,670
just means global I guess so by default

00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:48,350
said we'll look for the first match we

00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:53,359
want to use all matches and that should

00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:57,500
work yeah so it's gone now and I'll just

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:59,300
save the changes to make sure okay so

00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:02,660
that's how you use said just a very

00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:06,830
basic set command I also want to talk

00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:10,190
about using awk now said is very very

00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:14,840
fast awk is not probably not as fast as

00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:16,609
said in most cases but it is a lot more

00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,560
readable or that's what people tell me

00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:21,160
it is it's really not that readable it's

00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,160
very ugly

00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:34,900
so here's an example of using awk I just

00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:38,500
I have an awk file here and there's a 1

00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:40,480
or 3 times 3 multiplication table and

00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:45,550
I'm going to try to print out everything

00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:48,910
in the file so you've got to use quotes

00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:51,160
and then there's these braces and then

00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:54,430
print and then dollar 0 I have no idea

00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:56,980
why they thought of this like that does

00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:58,690
not look very pleasant but that's how it

00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:01,240
is so this is going to print everything

00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:04,170
in the Aqua if I want to print just the

00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:06,670
first column I would put dollar sign one

00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:08,859
and so on and so forth they can put two

00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,359
for the second column and this prints

00:39:08,859 --> 00:39:14,910
all the rows for the second column third

00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:18,880
column and etc now I don't necessarily

00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:21,040
want just a bunch of roles and columns I

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,170
probably want to do a certain rowing

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,820
Colin and mix and match those to find

00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:28,750
what I want to do that you can specify

00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:31,000
the row using n R equals equals one or

00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:33,910
two the number is your row number and

00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,310
it's not a zero indexed beast I think

00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:40,450
it's only one and it starts from one so

00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:42,730
that's kind of odd but that's the way

00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:45,130
they wanted to do it so now i'm going to

00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:47,980
show you all the columns of the first

00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:52,570
row and there it is and you can do the

00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:55,450
same thing for all right no this is all

00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:58,840
the columns for first row second row

00:39:55,450 --> 00:40:01,720
third row and now if I want to get the

00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:04,380
first column first or third row I just

00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:08,650
put one here and I got the two or the

00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:10,150
other numbers so that's pretty

00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:13,300
straightforward once you get the syntax

00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:16,119
down it's it does require a lot of

00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:18,040
memorization but I mean it's useful in

00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:20,080
the long run you'll find that you could

00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:23,200
point you almost anything you want with

00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:28,109
aqua said it's just probably not the

00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:30,700
nicest method of doing it but that's

00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:32,310
pretty much as far as I want to get into

00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:35,480
awk except for

00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:39,420
some commands that you can use with ARC

00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:41,030
such as the you can use substrings you

00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:45,110
can also do a lot of other things but

00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:45,110
substituting for example works this way

00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:54,650
and I want to print the substring of

00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:02,220
what's a dollar zero so all the columns

00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:04,830
and I want to start from indexed to and

00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:06,960
I think this is not this is one index

00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:09,420
based non zero index based which is

00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,800
super confusing even now I'm stumbling

00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:13,650
on this and I can't even figure out if

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,080
it's zero or one if it starts from and I

00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:20,640
want to I want to delete I want to only

00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:24,630
substring about the length of the row

00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:29,790
minus three I think I have all my

00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:34,080
brackets there oops go punching

00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:39,780
substring oops so best you are there we

00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:42,090
go okay so it only prints the first full

00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:45,750
n number of characters depending on the

00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:47,700
line it'll be different right so that's

00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:50,100
one cool thing with another cool thing

00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:51,450
you can do is like specify our variable

00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:58,190
say you have a bash variable that you

00:41:51,450 --> 00:42:04,770
want to load you can put in x equals to

00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:06,840
dollar my variable I don't have that

00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:09,480
variable but something like that would

00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:11,970
work and you can easily use your bash

00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:18,210
environment with OCH interchangeably so

00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:20,130
that's pretty useful and so of the three

00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:21,810
you have grabbed set a knock grab

00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:24,720
doesn't really do manipulation like

00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:28,730
seven oCTA's graph is only for searching

00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:33,360
and finding information however grep is

00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:34,560
very limited to what it can do if you

00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,180
can use grep I would definitely

00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:39,570
recommend it it's so much easier to

00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:41,550
understand and it's probably a thousand

00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:45,290
times faster when it comes to doing

00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:48,500
searches but do take a chance to

00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:50,420
learn SATA rock it might be a bit tricky

00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,190
at first but it'll probably be very

00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:54,980
useful at least if you're trying to get

00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:57,470
used to lenox and you want to learn some

00:42:54,980 --> 00:43:05,510
neat tricks with it and when you're

00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:08,840
writing your script okay so let's get

00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:10,370
into terminal emulators now if you

00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,650
haven't noticed already this is not the

00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:15,970
regular terminal window i'm using

00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:19,790
terminator right now terminator is a

00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:23,960
it's a forked version of the gnome

00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:31,640
terminal which looks like this probably

00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:34,250
noticed it oh so big so yeah the dome

00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,660
terminals pretty ok I mean you don't

00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,890
have to use Terminator I've just prefer

00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:40,430
to use it because that can do a lot of

00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:45,650
things like splitting windows such as

00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:50,240
that or that or that can do a lot of

00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:52,850
that but or anything like change the

00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,530
font size the font type there's a lot of

00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:57,620
fonts available in Terminator and the

00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:59,510
colors are really neat it's just for for

00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:03,920
the sake of having a nice environment to

00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:05,690
use but I don't necessarily do this for

00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:09,320
splitting my windows or organizing my

00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:11,420
windows because I use t monks now team

00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,820
website just kind of learned over the

00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:18,110
last few weeks right now I'm actually in

00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:22,310
a team ox terminal it's basically like

00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:25,550
screen if any of you know and if I want

00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:28,520
to what why do I use it is because if

00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:30,260
I'm in an environment where or in a

00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:33,770
situation where i might be disconnected

00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:35,930
from my terminal like if I'm SS a Qing

00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:38,780
in and Senecas network goes down because

00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:40,940
it happens like all the time then I

00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:43,310
don't have to worry about my current

00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:45,440
command or my current environment being

00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:48,320
completely destroyed because it's going

00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,550
to be alive in the team accession I'm

00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,650
just going to be detached from it i'm

00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:54,410
not going to destroy it if if i'm in

00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:56,300
Terminator or sorry if i'm in a regular

00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:58,789
terminal without using team ox and I ssh

00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:01,219
into matrix or

00:44:58,789 --> 00:45:03,529
another computer anywhere and I run a

00:45:01,219 --> 00:45:05,599
command that takes several minutes to

00:45:03,529 --> 00:45:07,880
run if I get disconnected halfway

00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,979
through that that commands cancelling

00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,589
out and that could be a big issue

00:45:09,979 --> 00:45:13,969
depending on what you're doing so I

00:45:12,589 --> 00:45:21,650
don't like that that's why i have t

00:45:13,969 --> 00:45:23,150
mucks mighty much does is it's wow I can

00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:26,239
do a lot of other neat tricks with team

00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:29,509
x so say for example I want to connect

00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:32,089
to this to this team accession I can do

00:45:29,509 --> 00:45:34,369
that from the terminal using team-ups

00:45:32,089 --> 00:45:36,199
attached because i only have one session

00:45:34,369 --> 00:45:38,689
so i don't have to specify the name and

00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:42,259
this will automatically connect this

00:45:38,689 --> 00:45:43,719
window to my current few muck session

00:45:42,259 --> 00:45:46,429
and you notice that the t max is now

00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:49,039
shrinked to sort of fit my current

00:45:46,429 --> 00:45:51,229
attached session and if i move it it

00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:55,160
also changes with me which is pretty

00:45:51,229 --> 00:45:56,689
cool now I don't want to k I don't want

00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:59,569
to close the team accession I just let's

00:45:56,689 --> 00:46:01,699
say I detach like I disconnect or

00:45:59,569 --> 00:46:03,679
something happened and I lost my

00:46:01,699 --> 00:46:07,339
connection to the tea mugs it's still

00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:13,359
going to be alive because I oh god what

00:46:07,339 --> 00:46:17,979
I do I don't know I just pressed well

00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:27,679
let's try that again okay I'm attached

00:46:17,979 --> 00:46:30,619
how do i detach obd-ii I was in control

00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:32,929
80 I did the wrong one so control be d

00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:36,259
okay I detached but you notice this one

00:46:32,929 --> 00:46:39,469
did not close the last example just

00:46:36,259 --> 00:46:41,179
forget about that that never happened so

00:46:39,469 --> 00:46:45,799
I detached and if that were to happen in

00:46:41,179 --> 00:46:49,159
a real scenario then I'm safe frequency

00:46:45,799 --> 00:46:55,099
mux protect me and let's say I'm running

00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:59,959
a command so there's this really cool

00:46:55,099 --> 00:47:04,549
command calls yes this is doing the wat

00:46:59,959 --> 00:47:06,229
up if you ever use a package manager or

00:47:04,549 --> 00:47:07,640
or something like something that you

00:47:06,229 --> 00:47:09,529
know is going to prompt you to say yes

00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:12,169
all the time and you're just really lazy

00:47:09,529 --> 00:47:12,680
so you just you forgot to type in the

00:47:12,169 --> 00:47:15,230
dash why

00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:18,490
options you want to just cook yes I'm

00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:21,800
going to attach this tea mug session

00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:24,380
that's going it's going but I'd blow a

00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:26,660
loose connection again it's still going

00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:31,640
it's not gone it's just detach that's

00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:38,089
all so yeah okay you can stop saying yes

00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:39,890
now there we go okay aside from the

00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:41,720
detaching and attaching the safety

00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:43,160
procedures you can also split screens

00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:46,670
with tea mug you don't have to use the

00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:49,250
terminator splitting which is this this

00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:51,319
is kind of it's nice but it's not the

00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:53,450
same like this one's a team obsession

00:47:51,319 --> 00:47:55,550
but this one's not now because I have an

00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:57,550
automatic config for this what I want to

00:47:55,550 --> 00:48:01,460
do is keep all my team work sessions

00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:03,849
together 11 team obsession with multiple

00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:09,170
windows so what I can do is control veo

00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:12,050
sorry not troll be quotes or control b %

00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:13,400
and this splits my windows as well and I

00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:17,260
can maneuver through them using the

00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:20,150
keyboard shortcuts as well and

00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:21,799
incidentally if I attached I also get

00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:24,589
that splitting which is pretty cool so

00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:26,780
it's it's still one terminal it's one

00:48:24,589 --> 00:48:29,089
team accession you don't don't worry

00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:30,680
about you know multiple terminal windows

00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:33,589
all over the place which I've been I

00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:35,630
started doing when I was a first new to

00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:39,530
linux I'm so glad I finally learned to

00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:41,690
be organized but yeah that's one of the

00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:45,650
reasons why i like team-ups it's very

00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:50,270
customizable as well like you can easily

00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:54,920
Oh are we running out of time we got 10

00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:57,980
minutes left okay I gotta speed up so

00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:00,440
that's enough about t max if you also

00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:02,299
want you should be using stream the

00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,819
screen command is very similar to t max

00:49:02,299 --> 00:49:07,280
but screen is about 30 years old now and

00:49:04,819 --> 00:49:11,000
so you know that a lot of the bug fixes

00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:12,710
are worked out but it is very very old

00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,349
so nobody works on it anymore so don't

00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:17,540
expect new features on it but it still

00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:21,020
does what it should what I usually do is

00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:24,170
the dms with the capital S command

00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:25,450
options the M stands for detachment what

00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:28,089
I think and the

00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:32,950
specifies the screen name what's writing

00:49:28,089 --> 00:49:40,240
yes command again and all name is this

00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:41,859
is the yes come in and run yes so what

00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,970
this is going to do now it's going to

00:49:41,859 --> 00:49:46,540
run the command in a screen session and

00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:48,369
it's going to run in the background

00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:51,099
without me having to worry about it in

00:49:48,369 --> 00:49:53,079
this case if I get disconnected as well

00:49:51,099 --> 00:49:55,570
even if i'm not using t mux it's still

00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:57,130
running in screen so i have that layer

00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:59,859
of protection just in case I lose

00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:01,359
connection or something happens so if I

00:49:59,859 --> 00:50:04,359
want to look at the progress of that

00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:06,700
screen now I do dash X and type in the

00:50:04,359 --> 00:50:10,150
sea I was tabbing again tabbing works

00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:11,950
for most commands I can now execute it

00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:14,410
and you can see I'm here and if I want

00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:19,900
to detach its control ad for screen

00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:21,190
instead of a controlled BD 14 bucks so

00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,960
I'm going to I'm going to cancel that

00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:28,060
because I don't want it to do anything

00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:29,920
weird to my system okay and as you as

00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:32,349
you saw there the when the screen

00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,940
command it finishes running the the

00:50:32,349 --> 00:50:35,530
screen just automatically terminates you

00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:37,750
don't have to worry about cleanup it's a

00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:40,569
command finished it's it's working great

00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:45,369
but you got to make sure that your your

00:50:40,569 --> 00:50:47,589
application it exited correctly like

00:50:45,369 --> 00:50:49,900
there's no logging after screen like as

00:50:47,589 --> 00:50:52,089
soon as screens gone you can't see it

00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:54,520
anymore so make sure your scripts are

00:50:52,089 --> 00:50:57,869
either handled correctly with logs or

00:50:54,520 --> 00:51:00,010
just know it's going to work for sure

00:50:57,869 --> 00:51:04,359
that's enough about screen I want to get

00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:06,579
into them a little bit so I know a lot

00:51:04,359 --> 00:51:11,859
of you love them it's like the best text

00:51:06,579 --> 00:51:13,630
editor out there right so if you don't

00:51:11,859 --> 00:51:19,290
already know the difference between x

00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:19,290
and them or VI know

00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:33,330
the eye I mean by I don't even know

00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:35,970
anymore I do sometimes I'm really really

00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:37,740
old systems you might so if you ever

00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:41,400
have a chance to work on an old machine

00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:46,440
like say an embedded box that doesn't

00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:49,260
have a package manager or like pre Linux

00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,520
you know unix environment and you don't

00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:52,650
have them improved you don't have that

00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:54,630
access it's just it's just an old

00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:57,570
version you don't have the same features

00:51:54,630 --> 00:52:04,680
that been improved has for example right

00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:07,140
now whoops right now I'm aliasing vie to

00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:08,910
them so don't think i'm using them by

00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:12,650
right now i'm using the latest improved

00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:16,530
version by default you would have to use

00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:19,590
HK LJ to move around which is kind of

00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:21,240
odd with the old version but thankfully

00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:24,150
in the improved version you have the

00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:28,980
arrow keys to use oh that was a painful

00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:30,120
thing painful time but so yeah some for

00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:34,620
those of you who don't know how to use

00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:37,500
them at all use the W key to go through

00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:39,090
each word starting with the beginning of

00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,650
the line you need to go to the end of

00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:44,910
the line with each word and we get to go

00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:47,880
to the end or the beginning of each word

00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:50,070
going backwards this is just so that you

00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:52,830
don't spend a lot of time you know going

00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:56,070
one by one it just helps to improve

00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:59,790
movement in them not something you might

00:52:56,070 --> 00:53:02,040
be using regularly but also traversing

00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:04,410
between different braces or brackets is

00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:07,620
very useful or even quotes using the

00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:09,710
percent sign which is very helpful if

00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:12,080
you have a very very big function or

00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:14,400
class or something or like a for loop

00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,960
and you don't want to necessarily scroll

00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,350
down to the bottom you just instantly

00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,820
warp to the which side you want to go to

00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:22,650
another thing is if you want to go to a

00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:25,700
specific line number you use the colon

00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:30,660
line number and it'll immediately aww

00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:33,119
whoops no my lines are not lined up

00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:34,170
anymore well line 20 is there

00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:36,599
even though it should be there I think I

00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:38,640
moved my text a little bit but that's

00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:41,309
okay I think you get the idea if you

00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:44,400
want to go to the bottom or the top to

00:53:41,309 --> 00:53:48,390
go to the top you just do capital g bars

00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:51,450
i right I always get those confused gigi

00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:54,299
is top or gee-gees bottom I got the

00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:57,210
message yeah ok sorry Gigi goes to the

00:53:54,299 --> 00:53:58,619
top capital G goes to the bottom this is

00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:00,920
very useful when you have like a

00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:06,349
thousand a few thousand lines of code

00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:09,720
another thing you want to go into is

00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:14,970
i'll talk about plugins for them but not

00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:17,069
right now manipulating tasks text so if

00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:18,930
you don't already know to insert again

00:54:17,069 --> 00:54:21,210
to instrum out you just type in lower

00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:23,309
case I or to start from the beginning of

00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:25,529
the line you can use capital case I

00:54:23,309 --> 00:54:28,950
which brings you to the beginning to

00:54:25,529 --> 00:54:31,049
replace a character use our I can use

00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:33,240
just one or two go in to replace them a

00:54:31,049 --> 00:54:36,690
replacement mode instead of insert just

00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:38,160
do capital R and you start piping always

00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:40,230
use escape whenever you're going from

00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,329
insert mode or a placement mode outside

00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:44,249
into the regular normal mode of them I

00:54:42,329 --> 00:54:46,170
find a lot of people get confused with

00:54:44,249 --> 00:54:47,519
this and the end up trying to type

00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:49,769
commands while they're in insert mode

00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:53,460
and it's like oh why are you doing that

00:54:49,769 --> 00:54:56,640
it's all wrong it can be confusing but

00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:58,619
remember there's always the just you can

00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:02,299
type escape as many times as you need to

00:54:58,619 --> 00:55:04,769
to make it work to use or to get into

00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:10,170
creating a new line very fast you use

00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:13,829
lowercase L or uppercase and lowercase L

00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:15,329
just makes one be lo uppercase is one

00:55:13,829 --> 00:55:17,910
about this is just a little shortcut to

00:55:15,329 --> 00:55:20,819
help you do your job faster to undo

00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:23,039
those just use lowercase you and that's

00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:25,499
undone to redo control our I don't know

00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:27,119
why I control our why not just our but I

00:55:25,499 --> 00:55:29,759
guess they have to replace their so they

00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:32,489
had to change it to something else the

00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:35,099
delete a line used ed to yank a line

00:55:32,489 --> 00:55:39,239
which is just copying just uyy and then

00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:40,470
to paste it p so I yanked that line but

00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:44,700
I want to delete multiple lines let's

00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:47,690
say I want to delete seven lines 7dd vdd

00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:51,359
not d all right

00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:53,819
seven yeah okay I made a mistake there

00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:56,250
if I want I yank five lines 5 x y and

00:55:53,819 --> 00:55:58,589
then I'm going to paste them here okay I

00:55:56,250 --> 00:56:01,050
got five more lines if I want to delete

00:55:58,589 --> 00:56:06,329
the end of a text I can simply do that

00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:07,560
using D dollar sign okay so that just

00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:09,450
deletes everything from the cursor to

00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:11,940
the end of the line if you want to find

00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:14,310
text in them use the slash when you're

00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:18,420
in eskape normal mode make sure you're

00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:20,130
not an insert right find text and if you

00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:23,369
want to find text without caring about

00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:27,450
the case just back shashi for c4 case

00:56:23,369 --> 00:56:29,280
and then find tux well let's just look

00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:30,690
for the fine and we see there's four

00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:38,270
different finds both have different

00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:40,740
cases about three minutes semih alright

00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:44,190
when i'm looking through different fine

00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:47,849
texts i can just use n to go through

00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:51,560
next and capital case n to go previous

00:56:47,849 --> 00:56:54,869
and one more thing i guess like a skip

00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:58,050
everything else to do reg ex you can do

00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:59,790
% s same thing as like with said you

00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:02,790
have the fine and you have the replace

00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:05,450
em g for global and you see all the

00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:09,480
fines have now been replaced to our

00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:11,210
fines are replaced now to save there's

00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,290
one quick thing i want to show you

00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:18,180
there's a really cool trick with them

00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:22,140
that you can do that so to save you use

00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:25,200
colon w to quit kool n q quit without

00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:26,510
saving colon q ! because sometimes you

00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:31,500
got to make sure you don't want to save

00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:33,359
ex just to save and quit now you want to

00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,940
make sure that you're not using WQ

00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:38,310
because x is faster and they don't want

00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:42,240
to be like typing the extra letter is

00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:44,369
too slow if you're ever caught in this

00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:47,490
situation where your file is read only

00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:49,020
and you really want to save a file but

00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:51,359
you've made like an hour's work of

00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:52,710
changing this text and it tells you you

00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,630
can't save you don't have permission to

00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:57,089
save and some people struggle they're

00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:59,849
like oh I'm going to try to zoom out and

00:57:57,089 --> 00:58:00,320
try to select all the text and then copy

00:57:59,849 --> 00:58:01,580
it to the

00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:04,130
board and then save it somewhere else

00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:06,950
but like get it that's just really lame

00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:09,680
don't do that or you can do is saving

00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:11,810
using sudo this is a really weird sort

00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,520
of command but this is going to ask you

00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:15,080
for your password and login as root and

00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:18,830
then it'll save your password

00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:20,570
automatically and now it should be saved

00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:22,760
I didn't make any changes but that's

00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:26,960
just an example you have to use this to

00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:28,610
exit out of there and yeah I was going

00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,430
to go into more detail stuff that looks

00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:36,620
like we're out of time so yeah thanks

00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:43,670
for listening is there any questions yes

00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:46,670
Oh is a status faster but to some people

00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:51,650
lock is more readable to me either both

00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:58,030
unreadable so I'm really cared sense

00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:58,030
bastard yes sorry any other questions

00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:12,550
I think that is as well as it I think

00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:16,720
you can reset bottles you can write a

00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:19,330
little okay oh he has more power right

00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:24,670
yeah you're right if I spoke percent if

00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:26,590
I can all right well anyway I hope I

00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:29,160
taught some of you guys some new tricks

00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:32,410
if not that's right Gracie you're done

00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:34,710
but thank you and enjoy the rest of that

00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:34,710
