Thunder I teach supposed to introduce

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,500
these guys the reason I'm in this room

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,380
has I looked over the description of the

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,570
presentation and I realized it for

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,300
probably a decade of an interesting

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,949
these topics in centralized

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,650
communication encryption things like

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,189
that unfortunately more than that I

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,960
can't tell you because I do know them

00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:31,349
kind of sure we learn everything but to

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:41,280
know it's going to be fun for sure

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:45,390
that's one here that's thank you all

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:50,219
right welcome everyone I'm Eric zone and

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:54,649
this is Audrina we are from sabaha linux

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:58,129
and we're here to introduce you the

00:00:54,649 --> 00:01:06,720
communication platform we've developed

00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:09,450
called ring quick start this is the main

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,549
goals we want you to achieve with ring

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,619
we want in an easy to use free

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:19,259
distributed communication platform it

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,560
means we don't want just a piece of

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:25,740
software like Skype is it's just a

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,330
desktop online desktop software we won't

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:34,710
hit a real platform that could be

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:38,189
embedded in raspberry pi routers desktop

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:42,500
as well but just the start is just one

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:46,079
of the use cases we wanted to to cover

00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:51,360
we wanted ring to be secure robust and

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:54,270
mostly in the main the major the major

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:59,310
major thing was to be able to build on

00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:01,860
open standards because it's not what

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,159
skype or egg out or I mean Google in

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,950
general are doing they are you doing

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:11,390
closed communication with proper

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:15,450
proprietary protocols

00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:17,030
it's like what tux does also it's the

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,520
same principle decentralized

00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:23,370
communication but based on their own

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:27,150
protocols the talks protocol that means

00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:34,610
that talks can only talk with other

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:39,180
talks clients it's just another very VIP

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:41,960
client and so this project is a free

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,660
software project based on license on

00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:49,650
gplv3 built by six core developers at

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:53,130
Sabbath or Linux and more and more guys

00:02:49,650 --> 00:03:00,120
coming because I mean it's a really

00:02:53,130 --> 00:03:02,610
really dated a piece of software we are

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,180
texting we are calling and we're

00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:12,320
communicating every day and for now all

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:18,060
the solutions are are not that are not

00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:20,400
open enough so ring was previously

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,670
called SFL phone you may know it it's

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,620
it's a sip phone it was a sip phone it's

00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:31,110
a project developed by salafi linux as

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:39,780
well for decade now and we revamped it

00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:42,240
as ring by the late 2014 what is sip I'm

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:46,620
not sure everyone knows what is if it's

00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:50,460
a STONER open standard in in business

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:55,790
and enterprises and in the communication

00:03:50,460 --> 00:04:00,570
world in general the main principle is

00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:03,690
there is a server good that serves as a

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:07,590
register for every clients every client

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:10,050
is a sip client été each client as a

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:15,360
count on the server and the server is

00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:20,130
basically an index where you just you

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:23,160
want to communicate with Bob Bob as that

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,830
IP address on this server but the prob

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,040
is there is a middleman there is this

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:31,260
server and between the two clients and

00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:36,510
without it you just can't call anyone

00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:38,600
it's not working so what we added in

00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:41,700
ring it's the decentralized

00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:45,600
communications it means we removed the

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:49,740
server between the peers everyone that

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,820
is using ring is a small part of this

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:57,510
server we all are with every client

00:04:52,820 --> 00:05:00,740
knows some other nodes what we call note

00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:03,480
like it's other people using ring and

00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:07,440
when you want to call someone you just

00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:10,740
asked to some of them do you know Bob

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,870
and the this kind of request propagates

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:16,650
until we reach the pier we want to

00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:19,230
contact and go it comes back and the

00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:23,520
call is made after that so we all we are

00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:29,070
all kind of small servers small indexes

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:32,280
and it serves to to just remove all

00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:35,490
infrastructure needed we just it we are

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,170
all clients and servers yeah so we're

00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:41,340
going to make us that demo so you can

00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:47,510
have a feeling of what ring is and right

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:51,360
now and so the currently this is the

00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:54,470
ring nom client we have a client for us

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,770
64 windows and there is a su a

00:05:54,470 --> 00:06:01,440
community-driven the KDE client we also

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:05,310
building an android client which is not

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:08,010
currently over but is under heavy

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:13,230
development so this is what ring client

00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:16,950
looks like I so DUI is under heavy

00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:22,260
development and we need a hand so if

00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:24,840
you're interested we're going to ring

00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,060
right here is in the same state as you

00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,790
will get it just after installing it

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,979
maybe accept the call the story on the

00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:35,129
left so when you start it for the first

00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:37,319
time you have no snow subscription

00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:40,619
on no kind of the registration to do

00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:42,689
there is no central authority when you

00:06:40,619 --> 00:06:45,569
first start ring it generates an heiress

00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:51,059
a keeper and that arrest a keeper will

00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:53,759
be used to identify you and at the core

00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:58,229
of ring is this number which is like a

00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,949
phone number and when you and that's how

00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:04,379
you reach other people by sharing your

00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:12,959
phone number which is actually a public

00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:17,969
key a public key signature so here I'm

00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:25,860
gonna I'm gonna call exams computers

00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:27,959
here what you see here the ugly ash you

00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,779
see it's Maya the number of this

00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:35,550
computer so I just got the call here I'm

00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:38,550
gonna answer it and here we go so what

00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:41,729
we did here the from this computer we

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:45,329
made a request on the public DHT network

00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:48,809
the network where all other ring clients

00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:51,479
are registered and this laptop made a

00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:56,659
request I want to talk to this what we

00:07:51,479 --> 00:08:03,269
call ring ID is really nicer that ash or

00:07:56,659 --> 00:08:05,569
public key and finally we found the pier

00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:08,999
so what is made after that it's

00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:13,919
basically a sip call it's a call like

00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:16,679
when you call it a polycomb or it's

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:20,490
built its there is no magic here we

00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:23,759
don't have a ring protocol or it's fully

00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:28,439
opera interoperable with other clients

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:30,569
and sip clients and phones using were

00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:34,800
using sip yeah so it's using the

00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:36,899
standard and robust sip protocol which

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,139
is used for instance to say oh I'm

00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:43,649
making a call it's used to negotiate the

00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:45,840
codec that is used it's used to if when

00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:47,780
the other person hangs up

00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,700
or post the call that is the SIP

00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:53,250
communication protocol that is used in

00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:57,060
communion to price etc and what you saw

00:08:53,250 --> 00:09:00,830
there is that in a few seconds just by

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:04,680
giving a like just a phone number I

00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:09,530
could make I direct IP IP call with

00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:13,980
appear everywhere in the world and

00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:15,960
without using any central server or any

00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:22,710
without depending on any central service

00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:25,440
the code is fully encrypted and there is

00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,820
no central point of failure and I will

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,870
show there is no possibility of

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:33,540
man-in-the-middle attack etc screen

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,430
Chang so in this client we already

00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:39,140
implemented many features so for

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,140
instance I can do a screen sharing

00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:45,480
actually you won't see it out yeah you

00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:48,090
can see the preview of what you're

00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,790
sending and on my laptop I don't see the

00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:55,290
camera anymore I see the the screener

00:09:50,790 --> 00:10:00,690
area that i Doan took for instance I can

00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:06,000
also i guess i can also drag and drop a

00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:08,880
file for instance and it may appear it

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,670
would be automatically stream instead of

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,820
my video stream yeah and i can enjoy

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:17,400
like on land or anything that my dear is

00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,200
just sending me and all of this with we

00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,380
certainly central server we certainly

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,210
central authority all of this is fully

00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,070
peer-to-peer except the initiation of

00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,140
the connection with uses the public

00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:33,780
distributed dish network that i will

00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:37,140
mention in a few minutes and we are so

00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,790
building in conference and this kind of

00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:42,470
advanced features as well that will be

00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,470
integrated in the next few weeks

00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:52,320
okay so so how does how does that work

00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:58,360
yeah what we are going to do briefly

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,960
we're not going to go much more in

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:05,500
details of security and everything just

00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:09,310
from going to explain how halley's can

00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:12,940
call Bob in this massive network and

00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:16,090
distributed network yeah so there is no

00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:18,460
server so how does at least knows what

00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:20,710
is that IP address which can change all

00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:23,230
the time and how does a least as

00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:28,900
confidence that she's actually talking

00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:32,860
to Bob and not someone else so open tht

00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:36,310
is a software library built from scratch

00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:40,750
because there was no such thing a

00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:46,210
variable actually so who knows what a

00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:48,910
DHT is not many people may be a few so I

00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:52,990
will try to explain it very briefly so

00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:55,900
maybe some of you know bitter end when

00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:58,240
you download a file / bitter end in the

00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:02,050
past there was a server centralizing a

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:05,740
list of IP addresses of people having a

00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:08,320
file but then there was legal actions

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,390
taken again those servers so they were

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,740
taken down so now how do people short

00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:17,170
files using the giant there is a what is

00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,240
called the bitter end DHT maybe some of

00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:22,860
you have seen the magnet links so those

00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:26,860
magnet links are actually links linked

00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:31,240
actually cheese in the key-value shirt

00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:34,570
at a store which the DHT is so as I

00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,910
mentioned the DHT is a key value data

00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:39,160
store it's it is a database that is

00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:41,740
shared between all the participants

00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:45,520
every participant owns a little bit of

00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:47,710
the data in this data store so the data

00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,690
is replicated between multiple

00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:54,910
participants so if a participant leaves

00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:56,050
the data stays here and any participant

00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,830
can access

00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:03,190
any data using an iterative algorithm

00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:04,930
that is based on the six degree of

00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,060
separation maybe you've heard that

00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:10,630
between any two people in the hearse

00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:13,450
this is I there's about six degrees of

00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:18,370
separation our maximum of six degrees of

00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:21,220
separation the taking mean icons social

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,810
social interaction so I know someone

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,180
that knows someone that knows someone

00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,410
and with a maximum of six degrees of

00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,880
separation i can reach basically

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:33,130
everyone is the wall so the same

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:35,470
principle is used by open ghg so that we

00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:39,190
can find a data some data on the

00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:45,220
distributed database in a very efficient

00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:50,410
way so actually bugs so how do we use

00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:53,110
that to make calls in ring so Bob listen

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:57,550
for changes on this distributed database

00:13:53,110 --> 00:14:00,600
so he asked the peers responsible for

00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:07,060
holding the data a if there is a change

00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:12,760
for my ID please inform me and so when

00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:16,620
Alice put her encrypted IP address on

00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:22,270
the distributed database Bobby inform

00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:25,660
and he can and if he accept the call if

00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:28,390
you trust a list certificate then he

00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:30,700
will reply back with his own encrypted

00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:33,240
IP address under the HD so everything

00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:35,740
that goes on the DHT is fully encrypted

00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,779
the only thing that may appear at some

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,970
point is the IP address of participants

00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:44,350
like every other participant of the

00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:47,440
jedge network but nothing more and at

00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:52,600
the end of the day most participant end

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:55,620
up with the other participants IP

00:14:52,600 --> 00:15:01,930
address that was uncredited for him only

00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:05,350
and at this point the gesture network is

00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:08,680
not used anymore and we do a classic zip

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:12,580
code using the standard sip protocol

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:14,680
and we do it in a very special way so

00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:17,440
that we can go through firewalls and

00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:21,000
through nuts and this kind of thing so

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,860
let's say that bud is behind a firewall

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,010
so Alice wouldn't be able to establish a

00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:29,080
direct IP communication to him so since

00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:30,670
bus peers have the IP address of the

00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:35,080
other player then we'll both try to

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:38,440
establish a communication and so that

00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:43,529
bug will try to reach a lease and that

00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:50,730
will work the same way like when Bob

00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:54,520
contacts a normal server online and

00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:58,270
after the the IP communication is

00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:01,230
established we established a TLS

00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:03,550
communication at this point we can check

00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,649
each peer check the other pure

00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:08,500
certificate check that it's the same

00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:09,790
certificate that were used on the DHD so

00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:16,870
there's a continuity of the

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:18,160
cryptographic operation an interesting

00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,709
thing here is that we use a very

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,709
blending edge TLS technologies that

00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:26,880
always used that allows us to provide

00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:29,770
perfect forward secrecy so even if you

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,839
even if your computer is stolen and if

00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:34,000
you even if someone recorded the

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,850
encrypted communication they cannot even

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,500
recover the communication itself using

00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:41,230
new key because it was using some

00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:47,920
temporary key that is already lost at as

00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:49,360
at this point and over this jealous

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,620
communication with stablish as classic

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:58,170
signal as we mentioned and that

00:16:52,620 --> 00:17:03,760
obviously all of this is encrypted so

00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:05,920
what ring does and what it does not this

00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,949
is the objectives we wanted to show you

00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:11,410
because it can be unclear what are what

00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:14,620
is encrypted what is shown to the other

00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:18,260
peer what what can we do with that so

00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:20,660
the goal with ring was too

00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:23,660
I assure the user of about data

00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:26,120
authentication and integrity it means

00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:30,320
that a man in the middle and attack it

00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:34,130
is not possible what you got you got

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:37,760
from any peer it's identified its

00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:41,480
disappear is sending this to you nobody

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,990
can forge packets and give them or just

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:49,160
yeah send you fake packets or pretending

00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:53,740
to be someone else each each peer is

00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:58,430
identified and the communication is a

00:17:53,740 --> 00:18:01,820
yeah secured the other point is the data

00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:04,430
exchange commission confidentiality it

00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:06,770
means that no one can recall or listen

00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:09,910
on what you're saying or sending like a

00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:15,920
video or text messages it's it's a

00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:19,670
encrypted channel so NSA too bad for you

00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:23,780
I mean I'm this one on this on this side

00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:27,290
you are you are the only recipient of

00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:30,260
the the data you you you exchange yeah

00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:32,270
it's in it's an IP IP communication so

00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,010
obviously someone recording electric

00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,870
activity will be able to see that

00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:38,180
there's a network activity between those

00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:40,310
two IPS but the communication itself

00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,830
will be encrypted with perfect forward

00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:48,220
secrecy so the young the communication

00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:52,160
see itself will not be recoverable but

00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:55,730
that I that matter that I will believe

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:58,580
in that case yeah we don't we can assure

00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:03,260
about complete privacy it's not liked or

00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:06,200
we don't I'd metadata information we

00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,970
don't we this is not the point offering

00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,340
we don't want to I people we want to I

00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:12,530
what they say and what they exchange

00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:17,030
like what that I would fight they they

00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:19,610
want to share so your internet service

00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:23,300
provider can can know you're you're

00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:25,850
trying to use a DHT network as well as

00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:28,160
other nodes that can listen about on

00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,600
your request about what's going on on

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,390
the net

00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,760
work so it's not a complete privacy we

00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:36,490
know and it was not our goal from the

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:40,240
beginning so it's just to be clear on

00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:42,940
that and it won't be the case it's

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,280
really difficult to find Wu is using

00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:48,550
ring I mean it's fully encrypted and

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,640
everything but there are ways to find

00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:53,710
about IP addresses and and peers using

00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,630
ring but however the communication is

00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,310
never going to go to a central service

00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,590
so the communication is never going I

00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:02,320
would go through google or a true

00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:05,380
facebook or anything like that so there

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,510
wouldn't be no possibility like if

00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,280
you're I don't know if you live in

00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:11,080
europe and you contact another person

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,760
you're in Europe the communication will

00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:18,970
never go to the server of an American

00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:23,790
company like Google with all the gala

00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:28,810
implications that's that for instance

00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:31,330
the only it really uses the internet as

00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,440
it was meant to be that is a communique

00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,890
at this centralized communication

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:39,940
platform for peer-to-peer communication

00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:48,730
between IP IP and that what internet

00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:55,680
still is we hope so we're going to talk

00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:59,530
a bit at the ring as a platform okay so

00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:02,530
why we use the term platform and and I

00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:05,980
just software it's because the way ring

00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:09,850
is built it's decoupled in two packages

00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:11,770
we got the demon the demon has no UI or

00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,740
anything it's not what we show you we

00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:17,020
show you a front end a client what is

00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,920
the daemon it's just basic Cyprus place

00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:23,890
it's the core the current line of

00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:27,670
communication of using DHT of sending

00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:31,360
audio video and sip calls everything is

00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:35,740
unveiled by this guy it relies on free

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:39,250
software components typo here ffmpeg all

00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:41,980
ebay for audio video pgc for the SIP

00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:45,520
protocol and communication let's

00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:49,720
it's a free open source tag sip stack

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,850
and open ght the component we are we are

00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:56,890
still active lobby this is a software

00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:59,980
library built from an existing code for

00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:02,980
the bitter end HD where that Ted it for

00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:06,309
needs because the bit turned HD in the

00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:10,840
bitterness hd's IP our IP addresses are

00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:12,640
not encrypted and the IP addresses and

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,130
encrypted IP addresses are generating

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,620
you can store the distributed database

00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:20,140
of the bitter edge network so we built

00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:23,799
our own DHT library that is a much more

00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:26,679
powerful with encryption belton and it's

00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:30,880
a new pens it's a free software project

00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:33,549
on github so it's you can it's opened h2

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:38,380
that net it redirects to the Gita page

00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:40,419
and so the demon can be shaped in if

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,360
this is the this part of ring that can

00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:47,410
be shipped in in raspberry pi or bigger

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:50,760
boom we have one actually hooked up here

00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:54,549
so and the demon is running on it so

00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,870
we're gonna do look familiar yeah we're

00:22:54,549 --> 00:23:00,210
gonna do we're going to try to do that

00:22:55,870 --> 00:23:06,070
just a quick call with a bigger bowl and

00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:08,380
see how it works okay we are here here

00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:11,530
it is we can show you here because the

00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:15,490
power source is it's over here so it's

00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:20,950
too it's too short but it's basically a

00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:26,400
really small board and with at a net

00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:26,400
cable a USB camera and that's it

00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:36,270
hmm

00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:47,109
okay human is running

00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:59,210
in the meantime I can show you I can

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,140
tell you a little bit about the the UI

00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:04,780
so this is the ring ID you're going to

00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:08,150
need to share when you are installing

00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:11,000
you're going to and the software is

00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:14,320
going to generate for you the the ring

00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,670
ID here the huge number the large number

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,640
this is what you need to share with your

00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:24,980
friends really you can set it by text

00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:30,950
message or email and this is the number

00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:33,380
that I garlic and ok so now i have the

00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:36,770
BeagleBone here we're running the ring

00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:40,010
type demon and on it and i'm going to

00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:44,690
call it from here so i'm gonna call it

00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:46,940
using the percy protocol so i'm going to

00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:51,309
type here the IP address of the

00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,309
BeagleBone and hopefully

00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:18,070
oops looks like we have a little problem

00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:18,070
here dimo effect stop it again yeah yeah

00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:26,900
screw the promotion yeah so much yeah

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,540
because there's an API there was an API

00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:39,110
break so there's a small and

00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:42,410
compatibility her but okay yeah so that

00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:45,500
is a work in progress but there is an

00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:48,650
ongoing research with team at you can

00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:50,870
University in Michelle and so work what

00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:53,450
we're working on is a dictation its data

00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:56,510
indexation on the DHT itself so

00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:58,940
currently this is a research problem so

00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:00,980
if you are looking for a torrent file to

00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:03,650
the online you cannot do this in a

00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:06,140
distributed way my master ins are

00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:08,510
distributed through the bittern eh

00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,890
network but if you want to find it you

00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:11,690
cannot do it under the distributed

00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:16,010
network itself you will need to go to

00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:18,620
some indexing site like at the birthday

00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:21,140
of this kind of website with many ads

00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:24,350
and this kind of thing and those the

00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:27,110
sites today are just an index of non

00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:29,750
torrents with associated magnet link

00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:34,090
linking to the distributed network the

00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:36,410
DHT but in in the future maybe you yes

00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:38,330
so in the future maybe we can do in the

00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:40,760
next session under the DHT itself so we

00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:44,000
don't even need those sites anymore we

00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:46,090
can do keyword search directly under the

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,400
distributed network so that's what we're

00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:53,300
researching for incorporation with you

00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:56,210
cam and that will allows a Louis in the

00:26:53,300 --> 00:27:00,290
future to select according to some

00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:03,830
criterias run them nodes and making and

00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:07,100
using those random node does run them

00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:10,279
turbine nodes to retransmit the

00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:13,609
communication case both

00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:16,039
both nodes both Spears are not are

00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:17,629
behind the net or a far wall if both

00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:19,609
years are behind on network firewall

00:27:17,629 --> 00:27:21,440
it's technically impossible to establish

00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:26,809
a direct IP IP communication between

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:30,619
them in most cases so in for many cases

00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:32,779
like if you are at home most likely you

00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:37,279
have you pin be and I build by default

00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:39,409
on your router so we use that so if

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:42,019
you're at home you will have no problem

00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:46,339
if one of the peers is not behind an app

00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:48,139
that will work out of the box so if you

00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:51,139
are shown and you have a pimpy you will

00:27:48,139 --> 00:27:52,820
be contactable publicly and so you will

00:27:51,139 --> 00:27:55,369
be able to contact anyone even if this

00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:57,710
person is the iron a nap and in the

00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:59,509
future even if both people are behind on

00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:01,879
that then we will select a third person

00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:05,269
and establish a TLS communication that

00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:07,039
will go through this third person and so

00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:08,960
the third person will only see the

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:15,619
encrypted communication goes through

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:18,019
going through and and that's it and but

00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:20,179
it's difficult because front signs there

00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:23,899
will be an android version so we

00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:26,299
wouldn't want we wouldn't want the data

00:28:23,899 --> 00:28:27,889
to go through an android phone because

00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:31,429
that will be too unstable and that will

00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:34,039
consume people's mobile data so there

00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:37,339
are a lot of constraints but this is a

00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:40,999
work in progress it would be like a

00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:43,580
service you know you like you One Ring

00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:46,700
user could say okay I can act like a

00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:50,119
proxy between two users between nuts and

00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:53,629
it will broadcast this info okay I can

00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:56,899
do that on the network on the ghd and so

00:28:53,629 --> 00:29:00,919
peers stuck beyond nuts will use this

00:28:56,899 --> 00:29:04,159
one too as a proxy to communicate this

00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:08,119
is done actually now for by turn servers

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:11,119
like turn gives you the real IP address

00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:14,989
but I mean it's a lotta it's it's some

00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:18,210
setup and we don't want the user to

00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:22,500
manually register a turn server or

00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:25,440
something like that actually the Beagle

00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,940
done received a call it's just the we

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,430
have a Python script controlling it and

00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:33,890
this patent script will require some up

00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:38,760
data to work with lastest development

00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:41,130
okay wonderful gesture okay where were

00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,620
we and whether Weber received many

00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:46,800
requests on github from people working

00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:50,550
on hobbyist project that using the ring

00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:52,350
demon because it's not only it's not

00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:54,330
only a decentralized communication

00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:57,450
system it also still works with the

00:29:54,330 --> 00:30:02,100
classic sip protocol so you can

00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:03,930
configure it if you have if your phone

00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,610
aperture provides you a sip account

00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:08,460
which is common in Europe for instance

00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:11,250
then you can use ring and configure it

00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:15,450
so you can make actual code to actual

00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:18,390
phone numbers using ring and also to

00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:20,670
ring numbers so people actually take

00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:23,820
this kind of beagle bone or raspberry pi

00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:26,130
put the ring diamond on it and they can

00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:31,160
build an actual wooden phone with

00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:33,780
old-style the dialer and it works and

00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:39,270
it's awesome and there are quite a few

00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:45,360
people who entered interacted with us on

00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:48,090
github about this kind of project ok and

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:53,280
now front ends so this is what we show

00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:56,660
you the gnome client at some of our Enix

00:30:53,280 --> 00:31:01,320
we are developing the OS six windows

00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:04,740
Python and Android clients so it's a lot

00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,720
of work and that's why you know we are

00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:11,570
trying to make a lot of things at at the

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,570
same time so it it moves on but slowly

00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:25,460
yeah thank you this one's are already

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:28,190
downloadable on our website the Android

00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:31,270
one is still under development and will

00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:34,040
be soon available on the website as well

00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:35,780
so you should check it out it works out

00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:39,710
of the box you can just start it

00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:41,059
generates a narrow snakey peruse the

00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:43,370
number you can give this number to our

00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:45,350
friends it will paste this number inside

00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:51,050
his ring and it's going to establish the

00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:54,770
call and it works already so it bind on

00:31:51,050 --> 00:32:00,830
the demon via d bus which is a bus

00:31:54,770 --> 00:32:03,260
coming I pc protocol or static linking

00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:06,200
you can package everything in one binary

00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:10,370
this is what we do for example for OS 6

00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:14,360
or windows because this is how we deploy

00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:16,880
stuff we just drag and drop a nap on Mac

00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:19,370
OS X in the application folder so we

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,580
want it to package everything so it can

00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:25,220
works both way either through IPC in two

00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:28,370
different processes the demon and the

00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:30,260
clients are in the same process no you

00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:34,070
are necessary I mean you don't have to

00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:37,370
do have a fancy you I it can work just

00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:39,650
the pipes and comments or common light

00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:41,840
come online the instruction you can just

00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:44,510
tell the demon what to do I want to make

00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,070
a call to this link ID it's just one

00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:52,160
come on line so it's really easy to

00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:57,530
start to to customize it for a specific

00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:59,390
use case yeah it's it allows system

00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:01,640
integration flexibility for system

00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:04,670
integration as well since we decouple

00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:07,850
the car communication and the clients

00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:14,900
and I already told you about the Python

00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:17,120
API what's to come so this is what we

00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:23,020
are currently working on

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:28,780
this is what this is a roadmap for the

00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:32,809
end of the year Christmas a lot of gifts

00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:34,880
text messaging so text messaging is it's

00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:38,740
it's a challenge for us because we don't

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:41,690
have an actual server to store messages

00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:44,300
just imagine you have one you're your

00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:48,080
own ring you want to talk to your father

00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:50,450
or mother you say hey hello but your

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,300
mother is not connected image is she's

00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:55,910
not registered on the ring on the DHT

00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:58,670
network where the message go we don't

00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:01,520
have a server to store it and and give

00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:04,429
it give it to wear when she just turns a

00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:08,659
ring on its will we have to find a new

00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:13,310
way to store messages and it's actually

00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:17,960
what we are trying to figure out with

00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:20,440
the youcam University it will be stored

00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:24,230
on the DHT but we need to define rules

00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:26,629
because otherwise we'll have a lot and

00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:30,200
lot of messages on the DHT and we'll

00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:33,889
just flew the further the network so we

00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:37,010
need to define rules and lifecycle of a

00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:38,960
message like maybe after two or three

00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:41,990
days a message that can't be delivered

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,300
is destroy something like that we need

00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:50,750
it's it's an open world we have to find

00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:53,510
new new rules conferences and call

00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:56,200
transfer this one are really almost

00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:59,510
ready they should be package and ship

00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:03,980
with the nightly build on the website

00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:07,670
really soon conferences i mean it's it's

00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:13,820
a basic feature for sip phones or any

00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:16,340
video come from a video software it we

00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:19,460
already had it in the previous project

00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:22,070
SFL phone and we are now just finishing

00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:26,120
and polishing things to make it work

00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:29,119
with ring cause i mean there is a bit of

00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:31,069
mechanics under the hood so

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,440
it's very powerful to be able to make a

00:35:31,069 --> 00:35:35,749
conference in a fully decentralized way

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,240
we sometimes server we set any central

00:35:35,749 --> 00:35:39,950
authority you just killed three

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,400
different people you make a confirms

00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:46,640
between them and in terms of bandwidth

00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,859
we actually mix the multiple videos in

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,890
this inside a single video so it's

00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:56,720
possible it's it's actually possible for

00:35:51,890 --> 00:36:01,549
people to upload this and to be a mixer

00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:03,769
for the conference and yeah it's a must

00:36:01,549 --> 00:36:07,999
work I mean it's already implemented it

00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:11,509
just requires some polishing when

00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:14,900
someone make a conference with for

00:36:11,509 --> 00:36:17,569
example let's say I want to make a

00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:20,930
conference between my my brother with

00:36:17,569 --> 00:36:24,529
ring and my I don't know my other

00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:26,749
brother with a sip cone I mean yeah he

00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:29,180
has a sip account and the ship extension

00:36:26,749 --> 00:36:30,950
and the other one is on ring but doesn't

00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:34,609
know that sip it doesn't have a ringer

00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:37,730
can sink a sip account so i can call one

00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:41,599
with ring and call the other with zip

00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:44,630
with ring a with my dessert with my wish

00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,900
my setup and after i can hook them up in

00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:50,420
the same conference they don't know your

00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:52,099
i will hacked as a mixer of the

00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,920
conference i will host i will receive

00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:58,099
their audio and video feed mix them

00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:00,829
together and send them back so basically

00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:04,700
we you can look someone from outside and

00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:06,529
enterprise with your I mean you may for

00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:10,400
example you're the client you're working

00:37:06,529 --> 00:37:13,730
with and the colleagues inside an

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:17,119
enterprise we are all we have they have

00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:19,430
all sip sip extensions you can call the

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,279
client referring and create a conference

00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:23,900
from inside the enterprise you don't

00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:27,410
have a and you don't need any

00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:30,200
infrastructure it just works out of the

00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:33,700
box for for everyone the clients and all

00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:38,960
your colleagues can make conference with

00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:42,530
a really quick way so this is the web

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:48,160
the web site ring that see

00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:52,850
x ring it's quite a general term so it's

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:56,090
ring calm was already taken and we just

00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:58,190
tried that Satan and it's easier to

00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:01,370
remember as well as I said if you are a

00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:06,380
developer you will find developer

00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:08,330
resources from this website as well yeah

00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:11,780
you will find access to them to

00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:15,460
documentation elder how to to make sure

00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:21,500
for how to deploy on on the mac OS x on

00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:23,510
windows it's all the documentation is on

00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:27,140
the website you will have linked to our

00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:31,400
our source code it's not on get up yet

00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:34,430
we use a garret for a for integrating

00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:38,480
our code so we have the garret hooked up

00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:42,770
in on the website you can access it and

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:45,320
see what we are currently working on but

00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:49,540
I'm pretty sure we will release it on

00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:54,380
github like a mirror or something so

00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:56,600
that's it we try to not be like to

00:38:54,380 --> 00:39:02,110
technical too technical but if you have

00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:02,110
questions are we are here

00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:14,450
ah questions on yeah

00:39:16,569 --> 00:39:22,740
Hosting other people's real competence

00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:24,710
for example or is it more like a DC

00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:27,620
two

00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:31,520
two-way communication to learn

00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:33,860
I mean like what re my hope if I'm

00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:38,270
running ring yeah I'm not talking my

00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:40,760
host game no no no when you when you

00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:43,460
want to make it when you make a

00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:46,340
conference I mean you your your you One

00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:48,770
Ring you call one one person another one

00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:52,010
you say let's make a conference you hook

00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:54,590
them together and your act like the oast

00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:55,970
but if you're naughty if you're not part

00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:59,330
of conference you're not going to host

00:39:55,970 --> 00:40:02,210
it what we talked about with on the

00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:06,500
earlier it's it's a when two people are

00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:09,470
stuck baby i nuts like there can't be

00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:12,080
reached they come with each other but if

00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:16,640
they use a proxy like someone in the

00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:19,370
middle I can reroute the communication

00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,120
it will act as a server I mean like a

00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:24,980
server they will transmit the

00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:32,150
communication but it's not implemented

00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:35,210
yet and it's still under development we

00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:36,980
deal with you know notorious latency in

00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:39,470
public internet write latency drop

00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:44,260
packets all those things that when

00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:44,260
optimization tries to try to deal with

00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:53,130
so we both adaptive bandwidth technology

00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,869
so that the bandwidth used is

00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:58,829
automatically adapted to the capacity of

00:40:54,869 --> 00:41:02,000
the link which is which is a technology

00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:05,010
implemented by a major communication

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,829
solution providers like sky Vanguard 6

00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:10,740
draw but most smaller project don't have

00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:14,460
this feature so we worked out to a bit

00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:17,940
so rincon work even in bad network

00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:20,339
conditions and even yeah I've been at

00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:22,920
trip to India recently and I've been

00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:25,349
able to establish group high quality

00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:32,760
coal with my father and it was very nice

00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:34,859
to see that working yes sire between you

00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,569
have a conference call need help if you

00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:38,369
have the person make sure to be the

00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:39,510
central hub for all communication that

00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:41,369
would mix the conversation and then

00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:44,279
reprod cast out each individual peer

00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:46,559
connected yep for the conversation in

00:41:44,279 --> 00:41:48,480
terms of load balancing on a network I

00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:51,089
guess that central hub would have to

00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,170
have a very strong stable connection in

00:41:51,089 --> 00:41:53,849
order to be able to receive and

00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:57,569
retransmitting is there anything that

00:41:53,849 --> 00:41:59,670
could be done to maybe shift the role of

00:41:57,569 --> 00:42:03,150
the hub to a stronger connection

00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:04,530
or with that ruined privacy in a way I

00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:05,819
know you mentioned you mentioned that

00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:07,799
you know you could you could include

00:42:05,819 --> 00:42:09,359
people in the conversation that are in

00:42:07,799 --> 00:42:11,490
part of the group you can add a contact

00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:13,410
that's not very rude I'm gonna make you

00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:15,089
were to shift the felt that could ruin

00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:16,829
privacy but it's something like that be

00:42:15,089 --> 00:42:21,000
done you know for example I get the

00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:23,220
person who's I guess initiating the

00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,670
conference call has two week of a

00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:29,760
connection to be the mixer Candice

00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:31,740
system but that that may be shipped the

00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,049
hump role to someone with a stronger

00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:37,530
connection yeah that's only a great a

00:42:34,049 --> 00:42:42,960
great thing to explore in the future so

00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:44,819
where I completely here to be a it's a

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,720
community it could be a wealth by

00:42:44,819 --> 00:42:51,960
communicating so to go to communicate a

00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:56,010
group maybe not all of the people in the

00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:59,190
group know each other so how ya how to

00:42:56,010 --> 00:43:02,000
do it in that trusted way and end at the

00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:07,650
my that way it's such a net for me yeah

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:13,980
what we already do it's we integrated a

00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:18,000
couple weeks ago its adaptive bitrate we

00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:21,480
react on bandwidth available and I dad

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:26,970
the video quality based on that so let's

00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:29,130
say to one PR has a really poor

00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:31,710
connection and the other is it as a

00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:33,720
perfect connection they will have info

00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:37,950
on what they can't send when they can

00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:41,480
support and adapt on it to like your

00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:44,910
lower the resolution and the frame sent

00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:47,760
in order to have a most stable

00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:50,540
connection and better visualization

00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:53,790
instead of packing drops and artifacts

00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:56,640
this is already a first step in in this

00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:59,700
direction but yeah shifting the

00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,790
conference to another peer it's like

00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:05,760
it's huge I mean you have to renegotiate

00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:07,119
audio video streams yeah trust issues

00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:11,710
about the

00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:16,690
the piers it's it's it's not possible

00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:23,319
right now but sure it's I would be the

00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:26,349
best case scenario is so their signature

00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:29,349
ashes tour going between their computers

00:44:26,349 --> 00:44:35,249
there are I feel like I'm back in the

00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:35,249
icq dates um welcome what does that mean

00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:42,609
is there has been any thought on

00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:46,329
adopting DNS pay schemes like email or

00:44:42,609 --> 00:44:50,559
txt records or translating these

00:44:46,329 --> 00:44:54,069
signatures into human family forms yeah

00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:57,970
but the challenge is how to do this with

00:44:54,069 --> 00:45:00,670
a breaking the decentralized assorted i

00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:04,450
Skype user so obviously there is a some

00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:07,240
sort record of association between email

00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:10,059
addresses and hashes are profiles and

00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,200
addresses we could even use director

00:45:10,059 --> 00:45:15,009
vertically we could even use the

00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:17,980
Facebook API to so that you can you

00:45:15,009 --> 00:45:22,359
could find your friends hashes and maybe

00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:26,079
we will even do that but we really want

00:45:22,359 --> 00:45:28,210
to keep it decentralized and we really

00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:31,299
want to not depend on a centralized

00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:35,019
service or server and but we are totally

00:45:31,299 --> 00:45:37,599
aware that copying hashes is not is not

00:45:35,019 --> 00:45:40,599
is not optimal in terms of the user

00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:43,839
experience so we are really thinking

00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:46,539
about how to make it more that's why we

00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:49,630
integrate with contacts on different

00:45:46,539 --> 00:45:51,670
systems because we won't try the ash as

00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:55,269
soon as possible i mean you have hash

00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:57,460
you call the de pere once the the next

00:45:55,269 --> 00:46:00,099
step you can just take the ash add to

00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:02,109
contact and choose existing contact i'll

00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:04,779
create a new one after that you call you

00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:09,130
or your brother or your colleagues and

00:46:04,779 --> 00:46:11,259
you don't call ash in when you start

00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:15,039
using ring a lot you have like different

00:46:11,259 --> 00:46:17,920
ashes okay so yeah my mom it's seven bc

00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:21,830
day yeah no it's not working even

00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:24,260
well yes you can add some hash to

00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:26,570
contact and create a new contact but

00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:34,010
it's not optimal it's completely not

00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:38,750
optimal target yes I guess where you can

00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:40,640
always just use you are yeah never have

00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:43,430
to carry that rather than having to type

00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:45,560
it in manually yeah yeah that's some

00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:48,800
weird that's some really cool way to

00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:50,840
share the ring is on mobile but we need

00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:54,500
to find ways to make work on desktop as

00:46:50,840 --> 00:47:09,920
well and this is the year we have we're

00:46:54,500 --> 00:47:12,650
still working on that yeah where does

00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:17,380
that run I i don't--but for him so I'm

00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:17,380
not but you said that there was

00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:25,560
that's not where open HT server like

00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:28,080
this yeah so actually yeah so the open

00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:30,800
ght is a decentralized network it's a

00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:34,590
distributed key key value the desktop

00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:37,950
but it's very lightweight for ring we

00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:39,690
only use it the only value the only

00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:42,570
values we put on this distributed data

00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:45,450
store which ring is the encrypted IP

00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:49,470
addresses so it's only a few hundreds of

00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:57,420
bytes and that's the only part that is

00:47:49,470 --> 00:48:00,180
public so every every ring client will

00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:03,000
run an instance of a penny a tree and

00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:05,220
will retransmit for other people very

00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,630
small packets of a few hundred and bikes

00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:14,700
which are encrypted IP addresses yeah

00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:16,980
exactly and that that's that's very low

00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:20,100
over and the protocol that's a very low

00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:22,290
over protocol that even if you look at

00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:27,150
your network man sweets you're not even

00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:28,280
gonna notice it because it's a very low

00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:31,700
background

00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:35,690
a few snacks that you advertised not

00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:37,810
your IP address but I address and port

00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:37,810
number

00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:46,220
yeah that's actually a currently

00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:48,170
supported so if you're a company and you

00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:50,330
want to use a ring inside your company

00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:52,220
you can run that a turn server which

00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:53,990
will be a relay server and you can

00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:56,750
configure this relay server inside ring

00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:59,359
and it will be added to the encrypted IP

00:48:56,750 --> 00:49:01,400
address you put under the HD and the

00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:04,820
other person will try to use this relay

00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:09,740
to connect to you in a completely

00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:12,500
automated way but the next step is to

00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:15,109
choose random relays online that are

00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:18,770
willing to be released and to use them

00:49:15,109 --> 00:49:23,200
randomly to establish the TLS

00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:23,200
communication using those relays

00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,640
I have the luxury of a whole bunch of

00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,760
mine

00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,640
look

00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:45,230
as I understand it most simple math

00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:49,560
boxes like your home world they tend to

00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:51,840
allocate to an f-bomb screen a port

00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:54,090
number and IP dress and they don't care

00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:56,760
what for traffic coming back they don't

00:49:54,090 --> 00:50:02,390
care what this source port the source IP

00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:05,550
address that bruh so if you have one

00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:07,740
piercing of your mat it'll work for

00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:11,310
anybody outside not just for the point

00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:13,890
where you want to talk etc I'm not sure

00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:16,350
what sorry okay maybe it is too

00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:20,460
complicated for questioning to present I

00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:23,820
code but I just wonder whether you don't

00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:26,700
even need to have a term server you need

00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:28,040
somebody to discover what and that has

00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:31,340
given a

00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:33,190
if your client behind that we don't know

00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:36,830
I do public idea

00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:39,380
and you don't know why port numbers game

00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:42,590
but if you discover that yeah the thing

00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:45,200
is when your most modern that's when you

00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:48,140
when you contact some external service

00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,840
will assign you a new random port every

00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:52,640
for every new connection so you will not

00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:55,040
be able to predict what what would be

00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:58,820
the external external port assigned to

00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:01,940
you by the net unfortunately and the

00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:04,790
first generations of gnats used always a

00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:06,320
simple or use the second shell pork so

00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:08,210
it was possible to predict what what

00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:10,100
external port will be used and that was

00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:13,480
used for instant by Skype which had a

00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:17,210
very aggressive way to bypass nuts and

00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:21,010
in part because of this and part in part

00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:25,790
because of the sky behavior then the nut

00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:28,780
design where stepped up and no you

00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:28,780
cannot do this anymore

00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:37,870
any more quickly other question yes

00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:55,030
this insert Els connection yeah exactly

00:51:46,660 --> 00:52:00,100
looks exactly that yeah exactly looks

00:51:55,030 --> 00:52:02,880
exactly like standard destinations I'm

00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,880
speaking of

00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:12,940
fingerprints

00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:12,940
yep just sign here a day with your

00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:17,780
well the bill is that if you just do

00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:20,119
this someone else would take the same

00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:23,480
name sign it tonight but if you're

00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:26,840
trusting you always signature always

00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:29,390
late so you have to trust in you

00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:31,820
regardless well but this way you don't

00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:34,460
have a name okay what you are very trust

00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:37,490
is not a tricky what your trays Trust is

00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:39,980
the private key behind it and the fact

00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:43,070
that there is a very adult what they

00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:49,580
call sign your name private key oh you

00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:55,300
mean okay yeah so don't say let's start

00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:55,300
getting that yeah your name son

00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:02,540
fine

00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:02,540
and

00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:10,380
maybe that's what was for prevent

00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:12,240
someone else from thinking if you if I'd

00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:16,550
end of the day you read up translating a

00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:16,550
signature becoming of the same at least

00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:24,280
partly partly

00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:29,839
the human readable part

00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:33,140
listening well actually it's in part

00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:36,559
then we were playing to do this so we're

00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:38,900
building a a vcard including your name

00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:40,970
and maybe your contact picture and we

00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:43,099
signing it and it's gonna be automatic

00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:45,020
automatically transmitted and export

00:53:43,099 --> 00:53:47,270
able to give that to other people ask

00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:53,359
your identity and it will include Europe

00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:56,240
MKE obviously and so instead of the hash

00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:59,240
you may you may have a like a contact

00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,289
card that would be attired and when I

00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,369
parking is filed there will be

00:54:00,289 --> 00:54:03,470
automatically only information

00:54:01,369 --> 00:54:04,880
associated with it like the name the

00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:10,099
contact picture this kind of thing and

00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:15,799
it will make it much more visually

00:54:10,099 --> 00:54:18,020
compelling and yeah but were really

00:54:15,799 --> 00:54:23,180
exploring this kind of idea to make it

00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:26,119
yeah try to hide the the half as much as

00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:29,650
possible for end users but we still want

00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:32,589
to keep the the safety and the trust and

00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:36,829
we must preserve the chain of trust and

00:54:32,589 --> 00:54:40,369
that's challenging there are many use

00:54:36,829 --> 00:54:44,720
cases we didn't think about so ring can

00:54:40,369 --> 00:54:47,089
be used for like value here I mean the

00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:49,099
same is the limit you can ship it and

00:54:47,089 --> 00:54:52,430
you can use it from the 500 security

00:54:49,099 --> 00:54:57,349
systems you can like plug cameras and

00:54:52,430 --> 00:55:03,039
all the building monitored we talked

00:54:57,349 --> 00:55:07,180
this morning with with a guy from able

00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:10,789
and it was working on project to to make

00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:13,640
different campus university campus work

00:55:10,789 --> 00:55:19,369
together and he said like one compasses

00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:22,279
for is using Microsoft skype the other

00:55:19,369 --> 00:55:23,210
one is using Google Hangouts and when

00:55:22,279 --> 00:55:27,290
they need to

00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:30,020
together they come so this is how the

00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:34,480
kind of solution that is like agnostic

00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:37,820
they don't doesn't it's not bind to to

00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:39,109
accompany it I mean everyone can use it

00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:41,210
that's why we're going to support

00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:44,390
multiple platforms and that's why we

00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:46,190
went with audio and video ad for the

00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:50,080
first use case I mean it's the most

00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:53,740
obvious use case give audio video and

00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:56,810
conferences to users to end users

00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:59,960
because it's the visual thing and it

00:55:56,810 --> 00:56:04,190
will help them understand it and after

00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:08,900
that add new IDs of new use cases for

00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:11,960
for ring and if you think about it email

00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:15,470
is a much less per probe than many

00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:19,280
modern communication solutions provided

00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:21,320
by a light say Facebook but email is

00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,750
still massively youth why do we still

00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:28,400
message we use email because it's an

00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:31,820
open standard that everywhere that

00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:35,330
everyone can use we software relying on

00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:38,030
a private company and so despite the

00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:41,810
fact that email may be considered a date

00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:44,030
updated technology it is very much used

00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:47,000
and will still be continued to be used

00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:49,580
in the next years because only because

00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,609
it's an open standard the 12 that anyone

00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:57,339
can acronym for free and that's what we

00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:57,339
are trying to provide with ring yes

00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:10,670
it's it's raw ever say keep earth and

00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:14,090
let's actually do so yes there is a we

00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:17,750
don't use PGP we use x509 but we use

00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:20,480
x509 in a very unorthodox way if I may

00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:23,930
say so we can we build instead of

00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:27,080
relying on a set of roots EAS built in

00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:32,030
your computer we add the possibility to

00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:36,200
add new trusted cas from the ring you I

00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:38,300
and so that you can for instance if you

00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:43,190
want to communicate with another company

00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:45,140
you can add this company CA into your

00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:47,030
ring so you will be able to contact and

00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:52,640
trust certificate from this company

00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:55,520
employees are bar if it fits for

00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,660
standalone use only for you the first

00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,970
time you start ringing it's going to

00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:03,080
automatically generate you a new CA and

00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:06,800
sign I certificate with the CA and you

00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:08,780
will really be able to either only trust

00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:11,480
someone else certificate just to

00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:15,320
communicate or trustee CA and other

00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:18,140
certificate signed by him so we made it

00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:22,730
a more powerful than the standard x509

00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:27,650
really relying on the hard-coded an arc

00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:30,020
of the list of trusted CF so question

00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:32,870
from the user interface inspector how do

00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:35,170
you call this for me to take my next

00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:35,170
laptop

00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:45,910
add it as a also need rain client so

00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:52,630
take that see a movie / generate a new

00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:55,090
ring IQ by that well this is the kind of

00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:57,010
thing that would be in Terry's e to do

00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:59,470
but we just haven't implemented it in

00:58:57,010 --> 00:59:01,920
the DUI so although all these kind of

00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:05,230
tools are not ready yet but it will be

00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:08,530
trivial to do with basic common like

00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:11,950
tools to generate circuit for now what

00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:14,710
we added its you can to generate your

00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:18,400
ring ID you can provide the key insert

00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:21,880
and certificate you don't you count the

00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:24,130
basic use case is you let ring generate
