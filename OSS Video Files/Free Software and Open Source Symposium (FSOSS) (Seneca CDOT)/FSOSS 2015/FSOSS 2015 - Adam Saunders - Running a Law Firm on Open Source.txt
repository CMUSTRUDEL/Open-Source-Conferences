welcome Adam Saunders he is a graduate

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,840
of the University of Ottawa's law school

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:13,440
and in his article with Ronald George

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,450
and the Chippewas of kettle and stony

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,910
point first nations which some people

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,600
may know as the site of the equal watch

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,400
crisis a few years ago mr. George

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,630
Spanish passion for justice for the

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,660
children of the pedal point left a

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,390
strong impact on Adams field the path

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,180
his career should take currently he runs

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,540
his own practice at the sole

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,710
practitioner and he is committed to

00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,079
access to justice and working with you

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,290
through plec cities of our legal system

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:47,820
to achieve the results user so that's

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:50,100
what I do hi everyone so it's an honor

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,070
to be here thank you for having me I'm

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,379
indeed a lawyer and as a result I need

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,989
to preface everything I say with the

00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,969
obligatory boilerplate so I'm going to

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,920
touch in general on some aspects of

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,010
practicing law but nothing i'm saying

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,960
here is legal advice and i'm also not

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,630
your lawyer just because i'm giving the

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,090
speech there's no lawyer-client

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,680
relationship going on here i know it's

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,869
getting late in the day you heard a lot

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,220
of detailed technical talks the last

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,470
thing anybody wants us to hear a lawyer

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,060
drone on for an hour I'm not gonna drone

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,270
on for an hour I'm going to drone on for

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,060
about 20 minutes so I can take some time

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,220
for questions if you're still awake I'm

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,229
going to spend this talk largely talking

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,030
with the feasibility of running a law

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,640
firm on as much of an open source

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:39,320
software stack as possible and I'm going

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:43,049
to talk briefly about what kind of work

00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,670
is involved when you're practicing for

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:46,079
open source software developers for

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,369
their particular legal concerns

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,530
associated with working in that field so

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:53,880
a little bit of background on myself I

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,340
went to the University of Ottawa law

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,540
school so I focused there ought to mix

00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,009
of studies between business law

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,380
international law human rights

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,640
information technology law I worked

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,890
there as a research assistant for

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,990
professor Teresa's casa the canada

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,429
research chair and information law so i

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,369
worked for her for a couple of years and

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,650
she taught me a lot of what I know

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:14,780
intellectual property law now she's

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,940
basically want to probably about a dozen

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,370
people in the world who has like strong

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:22,400
deep legal knowledge of issues around

00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:26,000
geospatial data so it was really amazing

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,110
to get those insights from her I've also

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,730
entered at the Canadian legal

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,860
information institute which provides

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,450
free and open access to Canadian case

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,690
law and legislation to the entire

00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:38,209
Canadian public I've also worked off and

00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,129
on as a technical journalist since I

00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:43,010
finished law school I've been published

00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:45,079
a number of times on lwn net which is

00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,549
one of the leading sources of technical

00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:49,069
news about the open source software

00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:52,609
world there my articles have been a mix

00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:54,890
of commentary on major court decisions

00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:56,870
involving open source software as well

00:02:54,890 --> 00:03:00,409
as technical exit particular open source

00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,760
software packages I also interviewed the

00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:04,430
executive director of the software

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,409
freedom Conservancy Karen Sandler she

00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:09,590
was also formerly the executive director

00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:11,239
of the genome Foundation and I did that

00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,890
interview for the online publication

00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:14,389
Model View culture which focuses on

00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,209
social and quality issues in the

00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:19,579
information technology industry latest

00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:21,109
publication was in Linux voice last year

00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:22,970
on the major software patent rulings

00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:24,319
that happened in the United States so

00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,299
that was my first time I was published

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,910
in bookstores and newsstands was really

00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:30,709
great feeling so these days I'm working

00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,970
on an academic text book about legal

00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:33,650
issues in free and open source software

00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:37,069
and I'm crowd funding the project

00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,739
through GoFundMe so I feel like I'm

00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:42,049
kindred spirits with you like I am

00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:44,989
invested in open source software

00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:47,900
professionally I'm invested in it as an

00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:50,329
intellectual passion just on a slightly

00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,669
different angle more on the legal and

00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:55,430
social issues rather than the

00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:58,549
straight-up technical interest that

00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,739
comes with open-source software so the

00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:02,540
kind of work that I do for free and open

00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:05,120
source software developers in particular

00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,069
involves general business law drafting

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,829
contracts advising unemployment issues

00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:11,359
incorporation issues and legal and

00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:14,180
regulatory compliance with things like

00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:16,010
privacy law sometimes I get queries

00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,560
about whether or not they can provide a

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:20,780
particular commercial offering of a

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,389
product based on third-party open source

00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:26,300
code so in these situations

00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:28,520
approach is to frame it through avoiding

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,039
a potential commercial copyright

00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,499
infringement lawsuit levied against the

00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:36,349
client for unauthorized use of open

00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:39,229
source projects this is a potential

00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:40,550
liability issue so in these situations

00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:42,319
what I do is I ask for detailed

00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,900
technical description of the software

00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,400
package in question what does it do and

00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,430
how does it incorporate the third party

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,580
code I find out a license to the third

00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,409
party software and there the analysis

00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:57,340
can often stop if the code is available

00:04:54,409 --> 00:05:00,830
under a permissive license which allows

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:03,110
basically unrestricted use so maybe you

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,000
have to put some attribution into the

00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:08,419
readme file that you include what the

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,279
executable for example but usually not

00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:11,990
much more than that now if there's

00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:13,159
copulated code so if we're looking at

00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:16,250
something under the gnu general public

00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:18,050
license i generally then request my

00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,960
client to give me access to the project

00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:23,539
source code whether it's access to say a

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,240
private github repository or even just a

00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:28,520
tarball sent to me and then I then parse

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,009
through the code to see how exactly the

00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,199
third-party codes incorporated and based

00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:37,039
on my findings of how it works and based

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,050
on the nature of e-copy lifted license I

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,169
then provide advice to the client on

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:45,229
whether or not they can proceed whether

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:46,729
they're okay to provide a commercial

00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:48,919
offering as they wanted or if they

00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:51,949
should pursue a different model such as

00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:53,509
a subscription based approach akin to

00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:57,589
what red hat does with red hat

00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:59,210
enterprise linux I also offer copyright

00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:01,310
litigation services for open-source

00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,020
software developers wishing to assert

00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:05,539
their rights against a potential

00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,919
infringer there's actually a lot of fun

00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:08,479
that's my favorite part of my part of my

00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:10,639
practice is to work for open source

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:15,589
developers because I basically get to

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:18,409
geek out on code and get paid for it so

00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:21,050
we're here at this conference because we

00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:23,569
see the immense practical value there is

00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:26,360
in transparent valuable software owned

00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:28,849
by the Commons it really is a story of

00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,680
great success its powers everything from

00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:32,479
the smallest single-board computers to

00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,280
the world's most powerful supercomputers

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,110
and everything in between

00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,820
it runs our stock markets it runs the

00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,190
most successful encyclopedia and world

00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,600
history and it's the very backbone of

00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,550
the peer-to-peer communications

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,730
infrastructure we call the internet and

00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:49,840
take for granted every day but we're not

00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:52,430
using it on our desktops or laptops well

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,550
well maybe some of us here at this

00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,710
conference are but when it comes to

00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:01,400
uptake by consumers in general and small

00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:03,200
to medium sized businesses when the

00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,639
device requires human interaction take

00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,520
place with the keyboard and screen on

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,370
one end and a chair at the other end

00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:14,450
it's still very small so at law firms in

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:16,760
particular it's a hard sell so but why

00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:19,310
should we care if law firms aren't using

00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,470
lots of free and open source software I

00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,300
mean given the uptake and Android on

00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:26,120
smartphones and tablets it might be less

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:28,130
of a concern for some but the fact

00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,960
remains that there's about 50,000 people

00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,850
in this country who work as lawyers and

00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,650
then that doesn't include all the

00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:37,430
support staff they have working for them

00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:39,860
like paralegals articling students the

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,240
court staff who actually keep the court

00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,460
systems up and running so lawyers

00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,979
actually have a place to go and Sue

00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:48,169
other people it doesn't account for

00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:50,810
other like ancillary service providers

00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:53,240
for people like patent agents trademark

00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,740
agents or process servers or the nice

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,300
people who knock up on your house and

00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,810
say that you've got a lawsuit against

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,610
you so those are a lot of people right

00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,080
so this is a lot of people using and you

00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,150
need to use computers all the time for

00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:09,500
this work because you have to generate

00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:13,729
reams of paperwork mountains of text to

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:16,600
to practice in this field and it's a

00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:19,669
conservative world with conservative IT

00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,280
procurement practices but I tried

00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:23,810
swimming against the current as an open

00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,030
source software advocate for many years

00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:29,660
so I decided I'm going to I'm not just

00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:31,880
going to let something like becoming a

00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:34,610
business person in the legal world you

00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,469
know forced me onto windows I decided

00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,979
I'm going to still try to run my law

00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:41,310
office using the linux machine i had my

00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:43,380
linux laptop

00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:45,960
I was going to try it without microsoft

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,810
office or any of the specialty software

00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,210
that works just on windows which caters

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:54,140
particular Aten law firms like

00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:57,090
specialized practice management software

00:08:54,140 --> 00:09:00,050
so my SAT up basically was running

00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:02,550
fedora linux on a laptop from system 76

00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:04,980
so they sell laptops I work perfectly

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:08,250
with ubuntu and i had replaced at some

00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:11,490
time ago with fedora i used a minimal

00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:14,610
window manager called open box for my

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:17,130
desktop environment and I used packages

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,310
like LibreOffice events and licks to

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:23,250
handle my document processing needs and

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:25,800
thunderbird for email I used a really

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:28,110
useful package called red notebook for

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,839
calendaring and I use again LibreOffice

00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,640
for accounting I have a nexus 4

00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,070
smartphone running the latest monthly

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,830
snapshot of cyanogenmod which is an open

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:40,589
source android rom based off the android

00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:42,870
open source project I don't use google

00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:46,500
apps instead i have the amazon appstore

00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:49,350
here i caved i downloaded a proprietary

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,610
voice over IP app called line two so i

00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,890
can have a business number on my cell

00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,750
phone and make business text messages

00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,510
from it without disclosing my personal

00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,610
number i use a web service called

00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,650
ringcentral for e faxing so i can

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:04,170
actually fax documents via email

00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,940
attachments and receive faxes as emails

00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:09,570
with PDF attachments which is really

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:11,820
handy i use keepass 10 that's why

00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,850
keepass x4 password management and

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:18,089
wordpress for handling my website Adam

00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:20,310
Saunders CA my favorite fine was

00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:22,950
something called diff PDF for analyzing

00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,570
differences in PDFs which saves so much

00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,430
time when you're sending your revised

00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:28,140
documents for settlement back and forth

00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,810
between yourself and an opposing parties

00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,880
lawyer you ask them to make one change

00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,770
to one clause and you don't have to read

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,910
the whole 15 page document what I played

00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,130
again to make sure they didn't sneak

00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:40,440
anything in because you can do dips and

00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:42,570
I never would have thought to do that if

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,930
I hadn't dabbled in software in source

00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:47,160
code revision systems I was like hmm

00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:49,020
software developers run diffs all the

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,850
time why can't I run Destry legal

00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:53,180
documents

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:56,660
and so I ran the set up for about eight

00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:59,449
months and it was all right for a lot of

00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:02,149
things so you know basic tasks email by

00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:04,040
browsing that was all fine drafting

00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:05,720
contracts and separation agreements was

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,370
fine because libreoffice you can

00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:11,420
generate pdfs to make sure everybody can

00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:13,759
read it just fine but where it became

00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:16,610
problematic was when I had to dabble

00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:18,860
more into litigation to actually file

00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:22,430
stuff according to the forms prescribed

00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:26,180
by the court system and in that court

00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:28,490
system it's very Microsoft Word focused

00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,649
and the expectation is that there are

00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,449
lots of people who everybody runs

00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:34,490
Microsoft Office all normal people run

00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:36,500
microsoft office right it's synonymous

00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,600
with business document processing in the

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,620
corporate business and legal world so

00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,230
the idea that there's even an

00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,670
alternative is completely foreign of

00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:48,699
people right so it's just assume that

00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:51,889
you can handle these documents so

00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:54,410
LibreOffice is very good at opening most

00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:58,220
office documents and that makes it

00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:02,149
terrible for use in a law office because

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:04,430
Microsoft Office is perfect at opening

00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:07,000
office documents if you're facing a

00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:09,380
major deadline and you're open source

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,319
document processing system gives you a

00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,759
garbled docket that you can't parse or

00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:16,220
it saves a word document that you've

00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,170
been working on for hours it opens it up

00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:21,620
later in a garbled state you're in

00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:23,180
trouble right so imagine you ask your

00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,800
financial statement from a client right

00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,449
so you've had them dig through their

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,009
Canada Revenue Agency notices of

00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:29,899
assessments for the past three tax

00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:31,189
filing years you ask them dig up

00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:33,529
supporting documentation on their

00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:35,449
financial history you have them detailed

00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:37,730
and monthly budget spending right so

00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:40,009
you're bearing the financial details of

00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:43,009
their lives to you and they email you a

00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:45,040
DLC X file with details and you open it

00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:47,180
up in the tables are garble because

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,630
LibreOffice throws up when it sees

00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:52,069
visual basic macros you can't see half

00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:54,350
of the financial details because the

00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:58,130
tables aren't properly rendered you have

00:12:54,350 --> 00:13:00,280
no idea how to go about formatting it to

00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:03,080
recover the information

00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,030
so what do you do I mean you could ask

00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,320
for pdfs but then that makes it

00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:09,230
difficult for you to make substantial

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,550
edits it means you have to make your

00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:14,570
client to the edits and then send them

00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:17,660
back to you so that's not it's not very

00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:18,950
friendly you could ask them to install a

00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,050
real office but then you're in the

00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:22,940
position of bothering a client of your

00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,520
business to do things they consider

00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:28,670
strange like I can't use microsoft word

00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:31,190
like a normal person and learn like a

00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:32,390
new complete software program just so

00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,660
they can have access to what they

00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:38,030
already feel like is a ridiculous

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:39,790
convoluted legal system so what even if

00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:42,410
you could get them to do that in theory

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,270
it's there's basically no chance to get

00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:46,250
it to work because the government of

00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:48,260
Ontario itself provides electronic

00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:51,530
copies of all its legal documents in

00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:54,050
word and PDF formats and most of the

00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:56,360
word documents have macros in them so

00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,280
it's even harder for LibreOffice to work

00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,930
with them they might seem to be rendered

00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:04,640
properly but as I had found once you

00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:07,490
save the document and you try to return

00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,230
to it the LibreOffice turns out that it

00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,940
couldn't handle the macros and your

00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:14,990
entire document and a couple of hours of

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:17,180
work is and wasted so I model through

00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,300
try and figure it out and but then I my

00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:22,250
laptop got some major hardware problems

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:25,760
so I had made a backup of my files

00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:28,430
luckily and then I caved and I bought an

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,350
HP laptop running windows because I

00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,330
needed a replacement now and then either

00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:35,450
one that worked because work is getting

00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:36,980
very pressing and I still use a lot of

00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,840
the same open source packages on it i

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,480
still use thunderbird i still use red no

00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:45,110
packed red notebook sorry i still use

00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,900
keep a sex but i have a microsoft office

00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:50,720
subscription and it's made life easier

00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:53,360
for me I know that every single document

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:57,560
i will get will be rendered properly and

00:14:53,360 --> 00:15:01,400
that is a non-trivial concern in my line

00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:03,740
of work now I haven't even gotten into

00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:07,250
some of the special proprietary software

00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:09,710
that's made particularly for lawyers and

00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,089
is ubiquitous and legal profession here

00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:14,149
so

00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:16,370
good luck persuading lawyers to relying

00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:19,069
on these programs to switch everything

00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:21,079
over to Linux and here I'm just going to

00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:23,059
mention three examples so there's one

00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:27,470
called divorce mate there is Cleo and

00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:30,230
there's Tara view so divorce me is is

00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:32,809
kind of funny yeah a company that

00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,790
develops software programs used

00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:37,220
throughout law firms in Canada to deal

00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,579
with the needs of clients whose families

00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:43,160
are falling apart or had fallen apart

00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:44,589
combines two verbs that go together as

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,680
well as peanut butter and mayonnaise

00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:53,059
divorce and mate I think they should

00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:55,490
probably rebrand as a parts together so

00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:56,779
doing family law involves putting to

00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,579
learn lots of different types of

00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:00,709
documents so you got separation

00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:03,110
agreements for people who are trying to

00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:05,509
figure things out amicably cohabitation

00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,980
agreements prenuptial agreements for

00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:10,639
people who are building new

00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:12,319
relationships and then you've got court

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,679
litigation with a ton of documents so a

00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:17,689
divorce means an application often you

00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,939
have to swear an affidavit in support of

00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:22,550
a claim for custody or access to your

00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:25,009
children a financial statement detailing

00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:27,470
your budget and your income history and

00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:28,970
then you have to attach any appendices

00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,319
of any evidence or stuff you want to add

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,300
to support your case and that's that's

00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:34,819
just starting that's just actually like

00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,879
starting the court process right there

00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:39,259
way before you even get to trial so

00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:41,029
divorce mate basically offers these

00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:42,649
proprietary products that let you do

00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:44,449
this stuff faster and they automate

00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:46,490
complicated things like calculating

00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:48,889
child and spousal support obligations

00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,120
and they have clients I products that

00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:51,800
work only on windows and they're pretty

00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,449
expensive but they say oh you can just

00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,329
build this as a disbursement to your

00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:58,730
clients they've also recently offered a

00:16:56,329 --> 00:17:00,860
cloud computing option where you can

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,629
host your sensitive files on a Microsoft

00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,730
Azure instance on servers in the

00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:07,850
northeastern United States so you can do

00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,980
your work from any device but that's

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:11,360
even worse in terms of freedom then the

00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,980
client based options because you don't

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:17,630
even have an executable to work with let

00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:19,819
alone access to source code so Cleo Cleo

00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,750
is like a comprehensive law practice

00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:25,230
management software system

00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:27,600
it's like an all in one shot it does

00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,760
invoicing docketing of time case

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,220
management accounting appointments etc

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,270
you open it up when you want to start

00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,850
work and you close it when you're done

00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:37,830
work it's a cloud-based system prices

00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,920
range from about 40 bucks 210 a month

00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,760
depending on how many features you want

00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,160
they've got a number of similar

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,650
competitors offering similar services

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,200
and they're all proprietary and some of

00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,730
them are client-based and so I looked

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,090
around the web to see there's anything

00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:56,730
open-source that was recent that could

00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:59,190
compete I found a lot of abandoned

00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:01,020
projects that had like 0 point 1 status

00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:04,320
on sourceforge and said you know

00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:07,200
abandoned don't use the closest I found

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:12,540
for something that's actually kept up to

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:14,460
date is civic CRM but civic CRM appears

00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,740
to be designed for constituent

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,410
relationship management for nonprofit

00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,180
organizations and you need to install it

00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:23,220
on a web server to work so you can't

00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,800
just install it on your laptop or

00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:29,070
desktop and expect it'll run it's it's

00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:31,320
not client side so I saw a post online

00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:33,150
from an IT tech at a non-profit legal

00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,700
services firm who is exploring whether

00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:37,320
or not they could use it in house that I

00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,990
haven't seen any follow so I have no

00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,340
idea if it was successful or not there

00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,890
are some companies that offer remote

00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:47,190
civic CRM hosting at a considerably

00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:48,480
cheaper price and Cleo but then I think

00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,580
you may have the issue here you're

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,210
configuring a management system that was

00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,890
made for nonprofits and charities to

00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,090
manage things like donations and then

00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,720
you're trying to make that work for

00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:02,970
for-profit law firm right so it's not a

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:07,250
drop-in replacement they have planning

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:12,270
to explore whether or not this is viable

00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:16,380
but I'm not sure it is that I lastly so

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:18,870
Tara view so let's say you're an Ontario

00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:21,390
real estate lawyer okay there are things

00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:23,580
you have to do you can't avoid doing if

00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:25,500
you're going to do your job so you have

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,540
to do searches of Ontario's land

00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,490
registry database as a regular part of

00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,570
your work right you want it you want to

00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,350
make sure that people are like buying

00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,840
the house

00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,400
the houses actually have the rights

00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,320
title to the land it's actually spelled

00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,059
out there and the proper transaction is

00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,700
going on you want to make sure it's all

00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:45,440
proper you want to register to eat or a

00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:48,030
mortgage for example too so Tara view is

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,780
proprietary software that lets you do

00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:55,140
this and it's the only software package

00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:56,190
available that lets you do this because

00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,950
of the deal they've made with the

00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:01,710
Ontario government and it only works on

00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:04,409
Windows and it costs hundreds of dollars

00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:07,860
to install and then more money for each

00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:09,510
file that you open and run on it so I

00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,940
mean you could go to a land registry

00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:14,370
office and do a lot of this there but

00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:17,190
that can be really tedious and slow and

00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:18,450
inconvenient and they might just you

00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,950
know shop you onto a tear of you

00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,620
instance they have running there and

00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,450
since real estate deals can be very time

00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,490
sensitive it's it's not really feasible

00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:29,250
options like if you're a real estate

00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:31,440
lawyer you have to run Windows and you

00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:34,530
have to run Tara do is there's no

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,000
argument about it one of the issues I

00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,679
have here is like you're talking about

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,990
very substantial financial transactions

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,970
for most people buying and selling a

00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,710
house is the single largest financial

00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,450
transaction they will make in their

00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,990
lives right these are like six-figure

00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:51,690
deals but without source code to the

00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,980
this database a system for registering

00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:56,850
these financial transactions for

00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:59,549
registering the these real estate sales

00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,390
and purchases without source code to

00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,909
this week we've got no security

00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:04,110
guarantees so I took a peek I thought

00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:06,750
well maybe they have some security

00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:09,270
disclosure statement about their

00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:11,429
practices and i found a page and they

00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:14,340
said all financial transactions are

00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:18,510
secured using secure socket layer with

00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:21,600
the minimum of 40 bits encryptions which

00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:26,130
can be fruit forest in two weeks with an

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:29,070
old laptop so the entire real estate

00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:31,580
legal profession is using what might be

00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:34,250
insecure proprietary software to help

00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,229
process some of the largest financial

00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:41,089
transactions in this

00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:43,559
and they don't have a say in the matter

00:21:41,089 --> 00:21:46,409
and so weird so we should go from here

00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:47,729
right so so there are no easy answers I

00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:48,899
mean for something like Tara view we

00:21:47,729 --> 00:21:50,249
could try demanding that you know

00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:52,109
projects like this where you have a

00:21:50,249 --> 00:21:54,629
monopoly on something that's of key

00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:56,309
importance to the economy you know to

00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:57,569
the government to make sure that you

00:21:56,309 --> 00:21:59,369
know property rights are clearly

00:21:57,569 --> 00:22:01,079
established here to real estate we could

00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:02,489
argue there should be transparency we

00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:07,369
should open source the Kobe should make

00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:09,479
sure that it's secure and kept auditive

00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:11,429
we could petition the Ontario government

00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:13,859
to make their court documents available

00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:16,469
an open document format arguing that

00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:19,229
basically requiring people to run

00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:21,479
windows or buy an expensive MacBook and

00:22:19,229 --> 00:22:25,309
have Microsoft Word to have optimal

00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:28,649
access to the court system isn't just

00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:30,449
but who's going to petition for these

00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:32,069
things like members of the legal

00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:35,369
profession would have the most influence

00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:37,979
but lots of them don't even know an open

00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:42,719
source software is or why it's valuable

00:22:37,979 --> 00:22:45,029
or why they should care so I think here

00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:46,769
that a technical approach rather than a

00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:49,319
political one would be appropriate I

00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:51,239
think programming alternative open

00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:53,249
source software packages to accomplish

00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:55,859
the same things the proprietary guys do

00:22:53,249 --> 00:22:57,869
would be the best approach we need an

00:22:55,859 --> 00:22:59,639
open source divorce may competitor so if

00:22:57,869 --> 00:23:01,739
everyone can wear easily fill in the

00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:04,319
legal forms they need to complete to

00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:05,969
access the court system we need things

00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:07,679
like compelling law firm management

00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:10,109
software alternatives that are super

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,229
easy to use and once they're made those

00:23:10,109 --> 00:23:15,119
are really easy cells so there are

00:23:13,229 --> 00:23:16,829
imagine holy sole practitioners these

00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:20,129
small law firms are trying to bootstrap

00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:21,629
themselves up new entrepreneurs some of

00:23:20,129 --> 00:23:23,059
them are doing pro bono work so when

00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:25,229
them are doing legal aid work and

00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:28,349
imagine that you know these guys they

00:23:25,229 --> 00:23:30,779
get easy access to high quality tools to

00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:32,459
help them do a professional job on a low

00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:34,249
budget for some of the people who are

00:23:32,459 --> 00:23:36,809
most marginalized by the legal system

00:23:34,249 --> 00:23:38,249
right so that's the potential problem is

00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:39,809
that free and open source software here

00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:43,259
in the legal world you get more

00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:44,130
efficient services cheaper and done in

00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:58,020
freedom

00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:59,460
thank you very much questions yes so I'm

00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,140
actually not allowed to call myself an

00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,900
expert or specialist until the Law

00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,910
Society improves me so I have to work

00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,720
for a few years and things but the areas

00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:13,400
of practice I do do are our family law

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:16,200
business law I do small claims court

00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:27,830
information technology intellectual

00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:33,750
property human rights labor law oh yes

00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:36,390
keep it open like my console busy like i

00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:43,380
don't think i would even if I gotta know

00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:45,360
something ok finds it ok and usually if

00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:49,260
you're in this is more than computers

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:52,290
together they do like deformation of

00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:55,680
like somebody's a bigger website if it's

00:24:52,290 --> 00:25:01,050
like stops with blatant example Dale

00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:03,840
righter so those who like knowledgeable

00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:06,960
computers as well because this sort of

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,090
kind of like capturing things like they

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:13,460
step in and

00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:17,100
so formation copyright licensing

00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:20,820
something like this Sam yes sometimes I

00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:24,960
people set up websites like the hook

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:27,170
something like something like cameras to

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,930
be proof of life changes right and it

00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:32,640
makes look crackin and sometimes people

00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:36,300
like given that upside back by mistake

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:41,570
and they stop thinking what about video

00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:41,570
business right so a trademark issue yeah

00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:58,460
that sounds great i'll look up thank you

00:25:51,420 --> 00:26:02,790
very much rogers phone okay thank you

00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:06,530
okay question yes first comment there's

00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:09,900
a document published on copyleft org and

00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:12,660
it's had a couple offers on it and it's

00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:16,290
a it's a tutorial and guy basically for

00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:18,180
trying to understand the GPL and it

00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:21,360
points out to sort of the introductory

00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:24,120
chapter how ironic it is that the legal

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:27,360
system and the legal system is an open

00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,840
system you're allowed to look at the

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,929
laws the laws are published

00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:35,289
but also the cases of the decisions of

00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:37,809
all cases are published and as a lawyer

00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:40,210
you know if someone came to you and said

00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:41,260
I've got this problem one of the first

00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:44,710
things you're going to do is going to

00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:46,830
run just to the law system and see are

00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:49,299
there other cases that are like this and

00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:51,490
imagine if the law system we're closed

00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:53,799
system where lawyers couldn't do that in

00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:56,409
every case had to be you know studying

00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:59,049
and analyzed and then thought on first

00:26:56,409 --> 00:27:00,970
principles but they kind of find out the

00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:04,210
irony that of course the legal system

00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:06,039
wants to clamp down software in that way

00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:08,919
we're not going to look we're not

00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:10,630
allowed to share something too and how

00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:12,940
of course you've got the whole cumin

00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:15,490
which is the way of hacking the legal

00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:18,130
system to use copyright law against

00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:21,550
itself almost an aside to preserve the

00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:25,520
freedoms that copyright

00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:28,420
yeah it's insert any of it yeah and

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,340
that's part of the reason why I guess

00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:33,200
that's spirit you know they leave the

00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,960
analogous issues here right if you know

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,430
open legal code and open software code

00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,140
there's one of the reasons I find

00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:41,030
working with a software developer to be

00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:44,510
like they're often the best clients I

00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:46,340
find because it is a similar

00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:47,660
appreciation for technicality it's for

00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:52,790
trying to figure out how complex systems

00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:55,580
work right yeah just a question normally

00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:59,330
when whenever i try to study like the

00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:01,940
GPL or understand legal software stuff

00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:03,980
of course in the preamble it's always

00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:06,530
you know well this is based this

00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:09,680
document is based on us alone may not

00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:11,810
apply to you I would be curious to know

00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:14,650
of all the open source but there's like

00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:18,460
400 open-source licenses like the

00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:22,700
Mozilla or the Apache or GPL leads to

00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:24,560
anything I would really be curious to

00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,850
know if maybe there's website somewhere

00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:35,169
or maybe

00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:38,330
all the clauses in oh I haven't heard

00:28:35,169 --> 00:28:40,910
about any particular issues involving

00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:45,020
anything in the GPL not applying in

00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:48,710
Canada but the GPL is in copyleft

00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:50,299
licenses in general are pretty clever in

00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:52,789
that they're they're really hard to

00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:54,260
actually attack formally to actually

00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:56,900
attack traditionally the legal system

00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,419
because you try to think of a fact

00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:02,230
pattern which someone would want to

00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:05,000
argue this cheat the GPL doesn't apply

00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:07,640
to protect themselves right so so what

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,750
I'm thinking is like say someone the

00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,650
size okay i'm gonna i'm going to make a

00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:16,039
what's a good example i'm going to make

00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:18,169
a box that plays dvds blu-rays netflix

00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:19,400
and i'm going to have a simple GUI and

00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:21,860
there's going to be embedded linux

00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,860
running in there and i'm not going to

00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:26,360
buy by the GPL v2 I'm just I'm who cares

00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:28,309
this is mine right then say something

00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,510
you know one of the GPL developers Seuss

00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:31,640
and says you know you need to disclose

00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:32,690
stuff or whatever and so what's the

00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,620
company going to do the company's gonna

00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:38,720
say your GPL license is invalid I get to

00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:40,789
do what I want right but it but if they

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,520
make that argument so then they're

00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:44,929
saying that the only public license so

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,919
the only potential right knee would have

00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:50,780
to use a third-party source code is

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,150
invalid so what they're arguing then is

00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:56,000
that the person who's developing this

00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:57,440
Linux package is actually providing

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,020
something that under completely

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,940
restricted all rights reserved model in

00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:04,190
which case the people making the netflix

00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,510
box still have no what I are arguing I

00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:08,330
have no right to actually make this

00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:09,350
thing right so I think I've been vocal

00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,970
in described as being something like

00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,950
he's a Columbia University law professor

00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:14,270
Minh very involved and free software

00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:17,809
laws like it's like an armadillo or

00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:19,760
something like no no no I think that's

00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:23,030
Larry Lessig from the Creative Commons

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,409
yeah so like if you're ever in a

00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,820
position to really try to attack it

00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:28,909
you'd read just shooting yourself in the

00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:30,720
foot right so so that's where it's

00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:34,710
uniquely strong you know

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,570
yeah sorry yes it's actually been a

00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:40,669
couple cases of device members should be

00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:40,669
aware where they've actually yes itself

00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:47,370
so that was one hearing it all by each

00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:49,500
other communities eventually happen is

00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:51,179
if you try to violate it normally are

00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,980
you going to shoot yourself what you're

00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:55,760
also to get back really bad so if you're

00:30:52,980 --> 00:31:00,210
ordering a company that's what you do

00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:02,250
yeah there's a social pressures that was

00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:04,710
annoying I don't care what them I Denver

00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:12,299
much about if I always out there really

00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:14,520
because I was one of their GP you

00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:19,140
something they violated and then report

00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:22,110
Germany a national open most of it yeah

00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:25,590
I don't know what we need everybody yeah

00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:28,380
I would parts highway so big and what I

00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:30,840
wanted to use much so right oh yeah one

00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,909
year is a long dry Trevor experiment he

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,049
brought up this with GPL in life device

00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:37,239
drivers it has never been

00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:40,389
test into the or let me figure out any

00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:42,369
possible so you're going to shoot

00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:43,840
yourself yeah it's also angry yeah

00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:46,149
because there's a to work you have to

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,799
arias like yes license is valid right or

00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:49,619
the license is invalid if the license is

00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:52,090
valid when they're at fault because

00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:53,019
they're not abiding by the requirements

00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:55,809
districts or standing there saying

00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:57,690
license is invalid then they're at fault

00:31:55,809 --> 00:32:01,080
and they have absolutely no right to

00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:05,049
distribute right says there's no good

00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:07,659
the kernel provides a specific exclusion

00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:10,779
that if you only need your face 2-inch

00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:12,549
to assist calls right yes yes wow they

00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:15,609
are saying is when you are the device

00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:17,889
driver in linux linux provides like an

00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:20,289
epi li for you yeah you don't write your

00:32:17,889 --> 00:32:25,239
driver from scratch so it all requests

00:32:20,289 --> 00:32:27,639
iron no I yeah yeah so so they're argue

00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:30,100
that there's a formal API and we're only

00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:33,460
interfacing with the boys solution

00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:35,080
another so of course it's cold right it

00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:38,619
is of course because I mean the

00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,359
Colonel's job was easy this is probably

00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:43,440
enough for drivers to the world wireless

00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:48,309
drivers used to pay for mine anymore

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:50,590
mostly and that is important to you yeah

00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:52,690
I just rampant infringement going on the

00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:55,509
embedding space like rampant yeah I am

00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:58,339
unwise they know that it's mostly just

00:32:55,509 --> 00:33:02,639
focuses one should

00:32:58,339 --> 00:33:04,200
by most of the big players like a DNA

00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:20,580
and they're not really screwing around

00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:23,960
with it oh yeah no absolutely yeah yeah

00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,960
I think that's what I'm

00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:43,300
well we haven't seen the whole text yeah

00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:45,340
so it's hard to write this is

00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:48,130
interesting stuff I mean I think that

00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:50,230
they're from what I have heard from the

00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,850
rumors have stated that there could be

00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:55,360
some potential nasty stuff we could see

00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:59,980
in a criminal space that particularly

00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:03,340
around breaking drm it remains to be

00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:05,440
seen exactly you know what that text

00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:08,950
might look like if I should incorporate

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,919
into the copyright act and it remains to

00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:14,409
be seen what Trudeau's exact answer

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:18,850
would be the prime minister-designate

00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:20,470
and the run-up said you know he would

00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:27,790
reserve comments until he saw the full

00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:30,820
text and I think we'll get them well you

00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:32,919
know it's do you you know it's didn't

00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,510
question is did do people do countries

00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:38,649
believe it's in their best interest to

00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:40,450
have you know a free trade style system

00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:42,639
which is largely dominated by the united

00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:45,879
states rights and so you do very strong

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,570
opinions on both sides and one of the

00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:51,940
ways and that's reflected is very strict

00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:53,620
copyright rules that have been put in so

00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:59,620
it'll it'll be interesting to see how it

00:34:53,620 --> 00:35:05,550
plays out you know I'm not sure really

00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:05,550
what form that could take yes

00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:19,150
okay I mean like I guess it depends on a

00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:21,550
particular situation I mean they're it

00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,500
with the RM space my understanding is

00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:25,810
the copyright act actually provides for

00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:28,660
some leeway for that because I remember

00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:30,310
there was issues before with trm laws

00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,260
the United States with people coming

00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:34,810
wanted to present academic papers on

00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:36,460
reverse engineering drm and they you're

00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:39,790
getting arrested stuff so I don't

00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:41,920
believe that that's the case here

00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:43,810
because when we got our dear I'm lost

00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,880
and I remember seeing stuff about

00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:59,260
research for reverse engineering and

00:35:45,880 --> 00:36:01,630
security not legal advice I mean I i

00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,040
haven't had clients yet come up to me

00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:04,390
like asking like i want to start a

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,400
reverse engineering process because i

00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:08,050
haven't had the opportunity yet to

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,630
really like delve into exploring things

00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,980
but my instincts would be to you know

00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:14,230
look at laws and see like are there

00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:17,380
things like you have to be like a clean

00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:19,960
room approach you know where you have

00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:21,880
someone who's looking at it and they're

00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,470
giving some information to someone who's

00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,060
like you never actually click the

00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,590
end-user license agreement or whatever

00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,540
you know you find the one guy who has an

00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:34,440
installed adobe flash or whatever right

00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:34,440
to try to reverse-engineer yeah

00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:48,520
bhante there's like I don't know yeah

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,250
there's like five or six advise everyone

00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:53,770
for every one of them the reverse

00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:58,120
engineering approaching ovaries oh yeah

00:36:53,770 --> 00:37:00,250
like I only thought I was the only one

00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:02,680
there isn't a song oh and something I'm

00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:06,460
very interested in but I don't

00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:09,820
necessarily want to be that person front

00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:37,360
page I mean I know that like red hat for

00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:43,960
example has a couple of employees ok ok

00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:47,460
I in the air I'm space here like the I

00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,460
like the catalyst after yeah

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,890
okay that's wrong okay mostly they're

00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,300
doing this because they kind of grown up

00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,890
like it I will figure it out that

00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:05,460
actually I mean it up straight driver

00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:10,440
yes jeepers ya know exactly and that's

00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:12,630
and now here I'm created but as I

00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:15,650
integrity I figure out having a doctor

00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:18,510
driver is just cheaper and ultimately

00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:22,950
you would have to go source driver why

00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:24,540
it was really small like you to raise

00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:26,520
your going to have a lot more calls

00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:29,220
mm-hmm like at ways to treat are

00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:31,140
designated by Intel so there's really no

00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:36,599
argument I mean a knob screwdriver

00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:39,420
unless unless you have it so yeah I

00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:42,270
think I think part of the reason we

00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:44,040
won't see we probably won't see more

00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,990
disclosure coming in from Nvidia is

00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:49,020
because they're claiming that they

00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:51,000
basically invented GPUs like they hold

00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:53,880
patents whether they're claiming you

00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,800
know basic GPU concepts in they have

00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,740
they recently started asserting them

00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:05,000
like for the first time ever like last

00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:09,990
year i think it was against android oems

00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:12,210
but don't quote me on that i could be

00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:13,980
wrong but i remembered reading last year

00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:15,299
that it was big news at the time because

00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:18,089
of the first time that they said they

00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:19,980
ever launched patent litigation and you

00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:22,079
know i was looking at it yeah my article

00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:25,470
is up there about it on I think lwn net

00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,640
and like there's like basic GPU concepts

00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,930
are claiming their patents like there

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,670
are other old patents but there's still

00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:30,690
valid right so I think that's part of

00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,770
the reason we may not see more

00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:36,740
disclosure and part of the reason why

00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:39,210
it's so hard at like a good open source

00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:41,200
GPU driver and where you have like hard

00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,820
work 3d hardware acceleration work

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:46,210
stuff for details are good right now

00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:52,440
other than the fact that behind what if

00:39:46,210 --> 00:40:01,410
I don't sin percent clear at all right

00:39:52,440 --> 00:40:01,410
it's moving fast yeah message

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:08,480
I he's not like yeah they thought they

00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:10,340
saw voice holes or even at furniture

00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,840
were coming performance they should not

00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:17,600
in the distribution yeah that's probably

00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:19,250
ever knows we get set around but

00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,890
honestly that sees you can use that

00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:25,370
issue wireless on which I we know it's

00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:27,260
mostly proprietary charger that they

00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:29,150
pretty sure yes in the decoration on top

00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,950
of that is mostly for a quick strikers

00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:35,270
are actually interested up trying to

00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:37,520
interest extremities over internal

00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:39,500
drivers for all these reasons there's a

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,770
good to maintain because Rockets drivers

00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,770
training

00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:50,130
so do we need you just a stacking and

00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:50,130
just installed that was probably easier

00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:55,900
so that's generally why they're doing

00:40:53,080 --> 00:41:02,230
that right yeah so it could happen on

00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:11,080
the fly right now right I drivers

00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:14,350
probably not that much yeah you said

00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:18,730
basically word is ubiquitous around the

00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:20,620
legal practice in general now Microsoft

00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:23,440
the cycle una morra subscription-based

00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:26,160
model where now you just can't purchase

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,630
we're now you have to pay every month

00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:32,920
whatever means do you think that's going

00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:35,160
to change the way that back industry

00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:38,590
works like you dig the film move off

00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:41,050
word office in general because of

00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:44,200
something like that I think well part of

00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:46,960
it though is Microsoft is a lot of

00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:48,280
inertia for the bill tap rightly there's

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,560
just like in the marketplace there's

00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,450
just a lot of people just have lived

00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,720
with it for years and they don't keep up

00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:57,070
with tech news because you know it's for

00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,990
them and we like keeping up with news

00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:00,550
about hammers or drills if they're not

00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:02,410
into like power equipment right it's

00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:04,570
like I'll just get you know whatever

00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:06,130
everybody else is using what I need it

00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:07,660
and you know hopefully it'll work and

00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:10,750
then you know replace it in a few years

00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:13,000
so so most people don't even know that

00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:15,070
there's an alternative really right or

00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,820
they might be aware that yeah they if

00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:20,920
they have an android device or no iPad

00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:22,600
but even now they now Microsoft's trying

00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,830
to put office on there but before they

00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,470
would be like yeah I know we have some

00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:28,030
things as sort of work but it's not he's

00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:29,800
asking is because it's just a

00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:32,980
conservative profession right it's

00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:37,570
really hard to get to so don't something

00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:41,830
more radical as a whole yeah are there

00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:46,000
any last questions or okay thank you

00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:48,820
very much I have a hand out of guns oh

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,150
thanks so much appreciate it no that's

00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,150
