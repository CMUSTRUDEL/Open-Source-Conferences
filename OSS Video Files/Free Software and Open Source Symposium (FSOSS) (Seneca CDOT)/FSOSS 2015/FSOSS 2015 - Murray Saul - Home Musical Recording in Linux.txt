more importantly in this context we even

00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:20,070
involved an open-source together

00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:22,650
slightly over the years back when I was

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:28,140
a student one of the projects Marie came

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:31,349
up with was not as yet you had an

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,829
honest-to-god like 60s controller with

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:37,230
pages over the mechanical button you

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:40,710
could push now make this work for the

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,680
computer and look there is nothing

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,739
digitalization did have electronic so

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,050
it'll really chris hope again that's why

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:56,460
can win pull out you connect that to a

00:00:49,050 --> 00:01:00,539
pc and somehow manage this year award of

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:03,239
electricity you've got cards came inside

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,390
this little thing anyway that was a

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,520
crazy project worked a little bit and

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,380
give it to worry to the senses this is

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,700
up your alley works beautifully in the

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,170
basement by the way at the same time is

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,950
north and all the things he's been

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,869
running a radio station linux-based

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,869
radio station back when that was

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:31,840
something almost unheard of

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:34,149
streaming media over again made some

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:40,720
legs and it's always going to audio

00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:47,110
plays in advance for to see what thank

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:49,149
you very much gender for most of my

00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:51,159
presentation I decided to sit down this

00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:54,039
time because i don't know if you saw my

00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,830
presentation last year but it kept on

00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:59,229
going in and out of the camera ok the

00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:02,500
audio was good but the part of the

00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:05,079
instructors presence wasn't so great so

00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,450
this is a continuation of what i did

00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,819
last year and last year i talked a

00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:13,590
little bit about my background my mom

00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:17,860
get me involved in music and kind of a

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,599
tribute to my mom unfortunately when you

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,760
teach a course like this you don't have

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,010
a you don't have a lot of time to go

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,530
into the details and that's what i want

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,599
today to do i want to kind of focus a

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,870
little bit more on the details and also

00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:34,840
i was thinking geez do I have enough to

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:36,280
to teach another thing of this and the

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,680
answer is yes because there's a lot of

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,840
things that I thought well this is only

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,970
something i do but i think it would be

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,040
advantage too many other people as well

00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,049
and maybe some things that you didn't

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,329
think about so i wanted to share this

00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:51,130
with you and who knows that that

00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:53,730
successful maybe i'll draw it out again

00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:56,950
and again and again and flog it to death

00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:59,709
anyways there's me in an uncompromising

00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:02,590
pose and flashforward about 45 years

00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:05,200
later and you know i'm in with quite a

00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:08,470
motley crew these are my actual band

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:14,579
members this is at McVeigh's tavern

00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:14,579
probably in a prior to us performing

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:22,510
basically i was interested in music

00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:24,639
recording in linux i think in my band i

00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:28,870
had more of a proprietary set up with

00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:33,340
windows with if i'm not mistaken native

00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:36,099
instruments before but i had dabbled in

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,410
linux and using it for recording and i

00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:42,640
liked it because you know it's cheap it

00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:44,980
was salon my alley of teaching linux and

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,860
an open source software so it was a good

00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:51,129
fit and I actually did bring this in

00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:53,530
several years ago here and it nearly

00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:55,660
killed me and I'm talking about bringing

00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,900
in everything including that wretched

00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:01,930
table in a car where and everything well

00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,840
it didn't fit but I made it fit and I

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,370
thought there's got to be for heaven's

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,670
sakes a better way especially if i'm

00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:12,220
going to go into using linux and the

00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,959
open source apps for you know playing in

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,970
a band playing life and back then i was

00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,040
on the internet and people are saying

00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,769
you can't do this and linux you can't do

00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,660
that which cheese me off and made sure

00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,669
that i worked harder to make sure i

00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:29,200
could so I could have something saying

00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:36,340
here it is in your face okay wait you

00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:38,380
know gives me a lot of motivation so you

00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,270
know let's be honest when you look at

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:44,919
this this ain't the pride of Muskoka

00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:49,030
okay from you know I haven't painted the

00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:51,400
darn thing it's done on the cheat but

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,200
and you you know you're at a bit of a

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,020
disadvantage because you don't see it

00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,780
like this it's beautiful you know so you

00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:04,180
deal with that okay dealing dealing with

00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:06,310
this and i love it on the cheap cheap is

00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:11,229
good I used to laugh at people who are

00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:13,720
cheap now they're my heroes and now

00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:16,060
there's no way about it you got to spend

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,160
money here there-there's note there's no

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:22,169
way about it but you try to avoid any

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:25,389
money right that's the game isn't it so

00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:27,789
what did I spend money on I spent money

00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:30,010
on a really good volume pedal I had one

00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:34,150
before broke this one's really good it's

00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:37,090
about 120 bucks i would imagine down

00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:39,760
below a nice pedal switch this would be

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:41,950
for sustained when you sustain piano but

00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,740
it does much more when i use it for some

00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:50,160
of these open source

00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:52,229
and also I use MIDI which seems really

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,550
whole fashion outdated he would think

00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:58,199
that I hear an I'm getting up again I

00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:01,139
should use usb has been my experience

00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:03,000
USB is a lousy way to hook up stuff when

00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:06,120
you're in a band because these thick USB

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,150
connections can break really easily but

00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:13,289
I find with us with the MIDI cables

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:15,120
they're quite the quite rugged and I'm

00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,860
using too many cables in and you would

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,080
just naturally assume that you could use

00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,150
MIDI through but it doesn't seem to work

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:25,169
for this particular machine so i had to

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:27,659
buy something that takes one midi signal

00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:31,289
and separates it into two and that's

00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:33,840
about 80 you know 50 to 60 bucks and i

00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:36,539
have something that takes midi signal

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,569
into the USB into my computer here and

00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:41,940
that and that's you know that's 40 bucks

00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:43,889
that long acquaintance down the street

00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,229
and I think the only other thing that I

00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:48,330
bought was this keyboard stand which was

00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:50,099
26 bucks if I was a pretty good deal

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,949
okay everything else my friends is on

00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:57,330
the cheap cheap I'm talking cheap like

00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:59,250
cheap first of all this is my work

00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:02,370
computer I guess this is being recorded

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:10,110
among get in trouble but I consider it

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:13,949
research okay now i did i did buy em

00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:15,330
audio keyboard it's a cheap one well but

00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:17,880
i bought it so long ago i'm not even

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,590
going to indicate i paid money for it it

00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,990
did break with the USB connection

00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:25,500
connection but i still use it for midi

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:28,440
and dis bought a the power cord for it

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:33,690
and i'll tell you why i like it in a few

00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:36,389
few minutes this 25-year old keyboard I

00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:39,030
didn't even buy it's my friends who I

00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:40,949
play in the band if you plays guitar not

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,599
keyboard he bought a long time ago i

00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:46,229
think for 12,000 oh twelve hundred

00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:48,150
dollars in 1990 and he took pity on me

00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:50,250
when my other keyboard broke and he's

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:52,830
letting me use it he's not bugging me to

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,440
get it back i'm not saying anything it's

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:58,250
a really really

00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:01,160
good combination here now what about

00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:04,940
this what about today I wanted something

00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:07,550
where I could put my the work notebook

00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:11,750
computer on put the keyboards on do a

00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:15,830
layer of course and and do it on the

00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:18,380
cheap so I had some two by six boards

00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:21,980
sort of cut them so the keyboard goes on

00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:24,200
a little bit of an angle for this I went

00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,720
to Home Depot went to someone said I'm

00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,190
looking for a couple samples can I you

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,500
know how much can I pay a couple you

00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:33,770
know two bucks per sample they all know

00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:36,110
it's a sample it's for free so I spot

00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:37,700
bonus so I go home and I start playing

00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,409
around with it and I cut them too short

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,270
and I said darn so what did i do and

00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:44,150
went back to home depot so I'm looking

00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,800
for a couple of samples we paid two

00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:51,050
dollars it was someone else out there

00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:56,030
for free okay good and so FYI anybody

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:59,960
from home depot I'm sorry the computer

00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:04,550
is attached by a very technical coat

00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:07,280
hanger and even the strap because I've

00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:09,830
been known as a performer to get a

00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:14,440
little crazy when I perform to kind of

00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:18,350
strap this wooden part in and what it is

00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:20,690
even pay for it I bought some what do

00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:23,180
you call a trim for the house from home

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:26,170
not home before they get angry at me but

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:28,670
home hardware and they had this

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:31,390
strapping I never throw anything away

00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:35,450
and then went to Walmart and bought a

00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:40,400
clip-on connector and it's just that

00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:41,660
simple so with all this logging about if

00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,310
I do seem out of breath that's because

00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,580
I've been lugging this stuff upstairs

00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:48,950
and whatnot I finally understand the

00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,170
true nature of what a musician is a

00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,850
musician is someone who loads five

00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:55,100
thousand dollars worth of gear into a

00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,920
five-hundred-dollar car to drive 100

00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:00,500
miles to a fifty-dollar gig very very

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,120
true okay I've been playing for a long

00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,640
time and I think that sums it up the

00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,690
best way possible okay so let's get the

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,510
let's get to business here so one thing

00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:13,030
that I did too quickly last year was

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:15,010
just go over what Jack was I want to

00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:17,530
kind of slow down to the teeny tiny bit

00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:20,230
and show you if you were a newbie you

00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:22,270
know how to kind of get it working okay

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,130
now you're taking notes that's a cool

00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:26,590
thing but I'll make sure that this video

00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,210
gets posted up on to my website and any

00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,830
scripts I'll have a post up to my

00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:34,360
website as well I my websites in the

00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:35,920
presentation as well so you know what is

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,070
Jack you Jax one of those things where

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,500
it's an acronym built in jack stands for

00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,660
Jack audio connection kit it's it's it's

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,000
great it's a low latency real-time video

00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:49,480
and audio server because latency is a

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,430
big enemy with with music you want to

00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,670
make sure that the system runs to peak

00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:57,100
proficiency a good now you could do this

00:10:54,670 --> 00:11:00,610
without using this app but I like using

00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,470
it it's called you q Jack control it's a

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,600
graphical application lotion manage it

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:09,130
and we'll show you why in a second but

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:11,950
let's show you right now so I'm gonna do

00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:14,560
this the old-fashioned way but you know

00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:17,740
I did promise for noobs so here we go

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,810
now i'm running ubuntu there's you could

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,820
install them into studio sometimes it

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,460
has really nice submenus like audio

00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:27,040
production things like that this i think

00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,560
i may have just installed ubuntu and not

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:33,220
stalled the studio version and just go

00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:36,850
to multimedia and there is the

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:43,150
application q jack control launched it

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:44,680
here it is if you normally one of the

00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:46,990
first things you do is you go into the

00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,370
settings you want to make sure real-time

00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,050
is selected or if you install it

00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:53,280
indicate you want real-time just to get

00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:55,720
the best possible performance period

00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,580
some other things that you would want to

00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,900
do and again I'm not going to waste your

00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,460
time in these settings because there's a

00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,310
lot of stuff out there on the internet

00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:05,230
tell you and recommend what you do but

00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:07,930
there are a couple of things one is the

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:10,390
input output device specify what it is

00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:12,970
in this case it's the you know USB midi

00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:15,430
interface that i purchased and i'm

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,830
taking this to analog output and

00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:20,290
sometimes they get confused and they

00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,459
take it to digital instead of audio and

00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,410
it can cause you guys

00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:24,790
little bit of grief the other thing is

00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,470
there's something called Minnie Driver

00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:30,179
normally to recommend it being at none

00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:33,970
but i am using some LD to plugins or a

00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:36,189
plug-in that requires that i set it to

00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,199
sequencer it brings down the performance

00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:41,649
a little bit but i can't really notice

00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:44,800
it that much ok once you do these

00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:48,189
settings then you start the you start

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:51,490
the queue job and either there will be

00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:53,679
successful or be a message earning

00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:57,610
flames and things like that this is good

00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:59,829
it's indicated started it indicated it's

00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,740
really not dragging a lot on the cpu

00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:05,230
which is a good thing and there are

00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:09,579
several tabs here there's audio MIDI and

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:13,779
alsa also would be basically where your

00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:18,119
connections are to your inputs to some

00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:21,490
of your main apps that use alsa MIDI

00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:24,759
I'll talk about later audio is basically

00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:27,670
where it's going out going to the system

00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:29,319
basically what you want to see ok now

00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,389
really there isn't anything that's

00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:34,869
connected up here for me to play around

00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:37,089
with so let me let me play something let

00:13:34,869 --> 00:13:38,799
me set up something now the way that I

00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:41,110
have it set up I'm going to run this by

00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,209
command line if you're curious on this

00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,769
you can always check my website where

00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:47,170
I'll have a script and you can take a

00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:48,850
look and play around and don't ever

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,129
hesitate to email me and ask questions

00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:53,980
people do every once in a while so I'm

00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:58,769
just going to open up a terminal and I'm

00:13:53,980 --> 00:14:02,709
going to issue a I can find it here a

00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:04,449
command to run a Hammond type organ ok

00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:06,490
it's called set me free I've only

00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:08,319
discovered about I don't know nine

00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:11,529
months ago maybe a year ago max and i

00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:14,619
love it I love it I love it I love it so

00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:16,569
we're going to run it what does it do

00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:18,970
does a lot of really neat things it

00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:20,369
brings up the Oregon graphically not

00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,019
that I really care about that too much

00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:27,579
but it loads in some presets on how I

00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:32,049
want the organ to sound also you'll see

00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:33,279
now that it's running and this is where

00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:35,470
my volume pedal will come into

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,870
handy right now the only place where I

00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:40,990
can play it is on this graphical

00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:51,279
keyboard if I can switch to it here give

00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:54,069
me a sec here here we go which sounds

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,740
pretty vanilla what I'd like is

00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:58,540
simplicity there's not a lot of buttons

00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,660
here it's not like i'm keith emerson

00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,759
playing around with this stuff forever

00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:06,910
but I can but I can get some neat sounds

00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:09,069
when I start playing with it and getting

00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:11,649
some sounds that I like and it just goes

00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:13,449
on and on and on and on and on why isn't

00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:15,759
it playing here on the keyboard simply

00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:17,529
because I have to make a patch right not

00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,509
so much a patch at the connect up things

00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:21,879
so the connections showing I have the

00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:24,970
emitter interface that graphical thing

00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:27,459
patches to set the free so I can play on

00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,959
the keyboard I don't want that so I'm

00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:32,290
going to select these two things and

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:35,980
disconnect it and go to midi interface

00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:38,759
to set the three click connect and i

00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,759
should be able to know

00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:46,279
if you notice i love that kind of sound

00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:49,490
okay so that's kind of neat that's kind

00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:52,089
of cool but I think you would agree with

00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:56,410
me that that's a major pain if you

00:15:52,089 --> 00:16:00,829
wanted to do this every time that you

00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:03,199
get prepared for a practice or for a gig

00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:05,720
okay there's got to be a better way and

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,839
there is so that brings us to the next

00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,509
thing here and that is you know key to

00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:14,779
performing life keep it simple I don't

00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:18,379
care is that I'm not out of La out of

00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:20,959
the video camera hope I don't care for

00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:23,470
keyboards that have the little knobs and

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:28,100
this million zillion gazillion things

00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:29,809
keep it simple I don't mean I want to be

00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:35,059
playing come on let's get real here

00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:38,329
right so so one thing like this is a 25

00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:41,420
year old thing so and even this is quasi

00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:43,610
it's quasi functional but I really like

00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,740
my m-audio keyboard and if I can find

00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,240
one that's more rugged I'll buy it in a

00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:50,059
second if it does the same thing that I

00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,980
like to do so here's a few things I want

00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:54,019
an easy keyboard control I want to use

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,360
shell scripts to automatically you know

00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:59,930
launch things and set things up I want

00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:02,870
to have my connection saved so there's

00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:05,750
quick setup and I want to because I only

00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:07,459
have one screen here as opposed to for

00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:11,000
that we're in my recording studio down

00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:12,500
in my basement to access these different

00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,679
things and there are a lot of programs

00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:18,380
to run so use multiple desktops and sort

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:22,909
of control that right so so number one

00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:25,189
this is a picture taken from a manual

00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:26,809
from the m-audio keyboard down below

00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:28,820
this is why it still didn't throw it out

00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:31,640
it's it's tailing with the USB but i

00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:35,090
still use it why because i can change

00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,580
the midi channels simply by clicking a

00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:40,070
function button and pressing a key and

00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:44,530
to me that's good engineering to me that

00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:47,840
simplicity and that works for me ok so

00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:50,299
just putting it out there ok you know

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,460
knobs and bells and whistles it can be

00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:53,310
good i guess if you're a musician but if

00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,650
you don't really

00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:57,420
peel to you and they confuse you more

00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:59,910
you're going to take five years just to

00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,470
understand how they work as opposed to

00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,820
keeping something really really simple

00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:09,240
you may want to look into this okay

00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:13,320
number two I want to have a mess load of

00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:16,560
desktop and to change to them and launch

00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,810
the apps there is a cute little command

00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:21,180
it normally doesn't come installed by

00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:23,370
default but it's called the WN control

00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:26,400
its window managers control that's going

00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:29,430
to allow me to for all the desktops to

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,810
just lay some apps on separate desktop

00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:33,660
so i can get to them if i needed to

00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:36,630
quickly another one that's really cool

00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,070
is called aj snapshot i just discovered

00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:42,870
this as when preparing for this

00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:45,600
presentation like one week ago ok and i

00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:47,640
used to in my shell script use a series

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,020
of commands and heavy duty scripting and

00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,780
parsing and all that sort of fun stuff

00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:54,660
command substitution to assign

00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:58,380
connections in in jackie's you can

00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:00,480
called a connect and it was good but

00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:03,270
there's a better way and that is aj

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,190
snapshot once you physically or air

00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:08,040
manually set up all your connections

00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:11,630
save it to a file and then recover that

00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:19,080
file and I like that that works for me

00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:20,850
ok so let's quickly just go in and again

00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,560
this will be on my website so don't

00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,150
memorize this or anything don't write

00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,010
down like a mad person you can always

00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:34,710
email me then I can send it back to you

00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:36,750
so if I VI into my own little area I

00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:40,260
have a little shell script called

00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:44,430
session dot bash some standard things

00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:48,930
here obviously some comments it's a bash

00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:52,670
shell script declare client number i'm

00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:55,170
not going to talk about this right yet i

00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:57,180
use entity i think it's a cute little

00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,860
tool for a dialog box just to select

00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,200
what certain things i want for my gig

00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,820
the problem is i was always selecting

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,410
the same instruments i wanted to use for

00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,320
my guy go over and over again so i

00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:09,380
modified the shell script to have those

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,710
automatically and then some extra little

00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:15,440
things like bring up audacity for

00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:20,059
practicing my performance or recording

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,649
stuff do that a set list so I can see it

00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:23,600
but when I'm practicing I'm not really

00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:26,870
into that you know things like that or

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,539
special effects so anyways it's a great

00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:32,059
little thing does entity when it runs I

00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:34,250
have them as checkboxes they show up as

00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:36,350
values that are separated by pipe then

00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:40,789
using the good old bash shell scripting

00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:43,759
you can basically replace the pipe with

00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:45,889
a space word the values so there are no

00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,500
spaces in it and then set them as

00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:51,440
positional parameters and run a for loop

00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:55,490
anyways that's for later what happens

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:57,649
after this is it determines the number

00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:59,450
of desktops that I want to use yes

00:20:57,649 --> 00:21:02,330
there's a magic number here but like the

00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:04,909
number of selections I made from zenna T

00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:09,440
plus three apps that i know that i want

00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:12,200
to have launched then we use the WM

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,450
control to basically go to that

00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,309
particular desktop number i set it high

00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:18,860
because i want to go on outer desktop

00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:21,500
number in words till desktop number one

00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:24,259
ok that's my that's how i have it set up

00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:27,799
so goes to the outermost line starts the

00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:30,919
jack audio server you'll notice I'm

00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:33,350
using sleeps sleeps are good too just to

00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:35,240
have it the system come into play i've

00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,700
used sleeps so many times when playing

00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:41,059
with x windows commissions it's a handy

00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:44,960
thing then launch what then go to the

00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:47,840
next desktop less one start the set be

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,080
free repeat started for Houston repeat

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,509
start for a piano module that i have

00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:56,240
here and then for the positional

00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:58,009
parameters said whatever i selected ok

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,490
and that's about it now there is one

00:21:58,009 --> 00:22:03,919
little stupid thing aj snapshot doesn't

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:06,649
seem to work well for Mike you sent so I

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:10,220
left in a little bit of an appendix for

00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:12,529
today's plot for today's demo and I'll

00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,440
figures this out but I kind of ran out

00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:17,490
of time so and so I had to physically at

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,460
the very end

00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:24,720
set a connection that I shouldn't have

00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:28,679
had to but whatever okay so let's see

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:32,040
this in place when i place the obviously

00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:34,290
the script as an icon so when I launch

00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,510
it brings up yeah I want effects i want

00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:38,760
the audacity recorder the set list to

00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:42,240
show up for today goes to the outermost

00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:45,450
and now it's starting to work its way in

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,059
words by launching the app why because i

00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:50,670
only have one screen here and with this

00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:52,710
make it easier to use ctrl alt the arrow

00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:55,590
keys to go to which one that i want to

00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:56,940
do yeah even without a mouse if i didn't

00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,580
have a no Sarah to do that very quickly

00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,590
I had to do something when I'm in a

00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,809
performance and it works for me and I've

00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:07,710
done this yes Martha would say it's a

00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:10,260
good thing okay now you'll see an error

00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:12,270
with audacity don't freak out I'm

00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:16,890
running 15 10 and I probably shouldn't

00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:24,570
have but that's okay i'm not going to

00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:28,950
bust a gut over it and so I got audacity

00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:30,570
here I got my setlist here I got some

00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:35,910
effects processors which I'm going to

00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:39,870
turn off for right now I got my piano I

00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:42,809
got Q since I got my organ I got my jack

00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:48,980
I'm happier than all get out also notice

00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:52,770
all the connections here are here okay

00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:55,770
so i should be theoretically being able

00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:59,330
to play this i also have this setup that

00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:59,330
if i change a control program

00:24:04,389 --> 00:24:12,440
it sets it up its simplicity right fast

00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:13,610
okay and i'm not talking about silly

00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,259
little connections here i'm talking

00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:19,720
about some pretty important ones for

00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:22,970
example my midi goes to my set be free

00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:25,580
my set free free Oregon doesn't go

00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:28,039
straight the system it goes to the Iraq

00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,389
Iraq effects which I'll talk about in a

00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:32,690
few moments and then the rock wrecker

00:24:29,389 --> 00:24:35,029
picks out goes to the system so so you

00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,909
might notice when I recover with aj

00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:40,220
snapshot you see that i use an option

00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:42,529
minus rx and it's a highly recommended

00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:45,139
meaning light wipe out every all the

00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:47,450
connections first even though jack has

00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:51,110
started don't let it think it knows what

00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:52,909
are the best setups and then boom play

00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:55,580
place in the setups that you want if you

00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:58,850
don't use the age a snapshot minus our

00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,740
acts dis- are and a safe i'll name it

00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:03,769
won't necessarily work quite the way

00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:06,799
that you want it to work ok so anyway so

00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:08,450
we got the we got in the organ right but

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,470
as i was mentioning they in a previous

00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:15,619
picture it's also nice to be able to

00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:19,490
change to different instruments that i

00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:23,240
could by changing a midi channel now set

00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:26,899
me free uses channels 1 midi channels 1

00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:29,240
2 and 3 top register bottom register and

00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:33,259
if i could afford it which you know me a

00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:37,190
foot pedal but I you know maybe someday

00:25:33,259 --> 00:25:39,350
if i win the lottery so down below here

00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:41,269
is probably midi channel one or two and

00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:45,860
we basically having the same thing

00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:49,610
that's here now now kind of multitasking

00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:53,539
here getting the sound okay i'll explain

00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:56,110
some of these things so q sense so you

00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:59,480
got kind of got a feel for set be free

00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:02,119
which i use them like 'ok you sent what

00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:07,100
is this it's a application that allows

00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:11,690
you to play basically sample tunes font

00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:13,820
on really call them soundfonts okay so

00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:15,980
how does that work well

00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,780
all without going into a tremendous

00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:25,580
amount of detail and here it is right

00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:29,170
here you can you can set up a queue sent

00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:31,940
to bring in loaded sound font file and

00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:34,040
then you can set them up for different

00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:37,430
midi channels so I've kind of left the

00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:44,090
MIDI channels 125 alone for other things

00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:47,860
but channels 6 7 8 9 and 10 or six seven

00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:50,660
eight nine anyways are set for playing

00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:54,230
different instruments that are on that

00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:55,910
are on my acuson sound okay a different

00:26:54,230 --> 00:27:00,950
instruments with different things how do

00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:07,490
i do is well midi channel is d he is to

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:11,050
half is 3g is for a is 5 b is 6 so b c d

00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:18,340
and e would be channel 6 7 8 9 right so

00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:18,340
function b or five okay it's plain

00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:30,430
sounds like a electric piano like for

00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:33,610
something like for those old parts okay

00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:38,260
and if I change it to another mini

00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:40,380
channel a little bit more heavier the

00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:44,200
previous one was sort of a sound for

00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:45,750
what we call a rhodes piano for this has

00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:49,570
a little bit more bite it's a Wurlitzer

00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:52,740
this would be something that Ray Charles

00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:52,740
would have done some like

00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:02,240
well this takes me two hands to do the

00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:06,350
base and this dude was able to do it I

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:12,030
don't even go there yeah maybe someday

00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:22,920
another one sort of elite st. lead sent

00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:25,860
for the cars got that idea and another

00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,690
midi channel maybe strings or something

00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:32,190
whatever okay I think you guys get the

00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:36,450
idea okay so simple simple control being

00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:40,310
live works for me okay one little thing

00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:40,310
on one little caveat could you say

00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:47,280
sample versus physical modeling they say

00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,330
that if you really want a great sound

00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,520
you should probably go with an

00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:53,790
application that uses physical models as

00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:56,160
opposed to sampling what would be an

00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:58,110
example marie modulate something that

00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,960
sampled and it doesn't sound good

00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:02,490
modulate something that is physically

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,050
modeled and it probably knows how to

00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:10,980
handle that the sound is better okay

00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:13,380
there are so there are physical modeling

00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,970
snobs out there I do like you sent but

00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,800
I'm kind of playing around with this

00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,270
physically modeling physical modeling

00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,130
and seeing what's out there so I did a

00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:23,300
little bit of research and there are

00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:28,890
some apps that are built in in Linux

00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:31,250
Hexter is a dx7 emulator there's why

00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:35,070
sense I think there's something called

00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:39,750
accent DSS I and you can use an

00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:41,640
application like ghost s2 to handle them

00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:44,220
and even assign MIDI channels which is

00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,980
kind of cool I haven't but they're there

00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:50,610
and they're available something that's

00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:53,940
really kind of exciting our plugins LD

00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:57,510
to plugins lb to linux auto developers

00:29:53,940 --> 00:30:00,780
simple plug-in API version 2 has a lot

00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:04,530
of really good plugins including piano

00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:06,460
electric piano synth did I like and I

00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:08,410
want to incorporate in

00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,360
and they kind of do things a little bit

00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:12,100
differently which is rather intriguing a

00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:16,900
couple of really good apps that you can

00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:18,700
use for this is lv 2 LS LS what does

00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:22,960
that mean to list stuff right so list

00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:30,070
what particular plugins are available so

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:36,340
if i open up a terminal and i do that lv

00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:38,230
2 s LS it shows URLs of what different

00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:40,090
plugins there are which is really

00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:42,310
bizarre because you need to use these to

00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:44,590
launch the plugin although you can be

00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:47,950
disconnected from the internet it's just

00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:50,650
a weird way that the app works okay so

00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:52,900
you use the other one that's kind of

00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:54,910
useful and in here there's one for piano

00:30:52,900 --> 00:31:03,220
you could type it to grep piano or

00:30:54,910 --> 00:31:07,090
whatever but is a gel veggie gtk which

00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:10,780
just allows you to run the plugins

00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:13,270
graphically and they don't look very

00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:16,570
impressive to look at but I don't care

00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:18,580
about looks I don't necessarily care

00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:20,680
that I have a nice little keyboard here

00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:25,570
I'm more interested in the sound and

00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:28,180
easy configuration so here would be md a

00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:30,640
piano yes it looks great it doesn't

00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:33,460
where are the keys I don't care I have

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,710
keys here thank you very much so long as

00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:38,260
you can patch me in here I can go to

00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:41,440
different presets I can save thing you

00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:46,140
know get different styles of things so

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,140
for channel 5 i've done this properly

00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:55,590
you can experiment with this and you can

00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:59,160
even affect its performance works for me

00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:01,650
one little problem and that is because

00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,390
it's a plug-in and I'm not sure on this

00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:05,070
but I don't think I'm far off the mark I

00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:06,930
think because it thinks that you want to

00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:09,060
use it for recording that it's going to

00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:10,560
hog all of the MIDI channels and that

00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,360
doesn't work for me because when I'm

00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,010
playing an organ I just want to hear the

00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:17,640
organ I don't want to hear the piano as

00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:20,400
well so how do you solve a problem like

00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,930
this there may be better ways but I did

00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,990
a lot of looking and there is an app

00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:27,240
called Q me tiro it allows you to route

00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:29,520
to different midi channels and that can

00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,280
make your jack really really look

00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,810
complex like a bowl of spaghetti but who

00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:37,920
cares because you're saving these things

00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:45,750
using age a snapshot anyways and in life

00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:48,390
is beautiful yes I'm coming to that at

00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:50,040
the end so stay tuned okay okay which I

00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:51,540
should I don't always but there is

00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:57,390
something I do at the end o probably

00:32:51,540 --> 00:33:00,030
explain how to solve it yeah okay so so

00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:03,690
what what happens here maybe I should

00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:04,860
explain a little bit better via Jack and

00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,680
don't worry there's not going to be a

00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:10,590
test at the end of this okay but I have

00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:12,930
a midi interface you know where is the

00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:15,180
MDA piano that I launched its not here

00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:19,410
no it's actually in the middle section

00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:22,500
so how do I solve this and connect up

00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:24,690
things I in the set up for Jack I said I

00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:30,110
for the also a server I want to use

00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:33,300
sequence not none not raw but seq I

00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:38,370
wanted to set up from my midi interface

00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:40,590
a patch to q midi road saved as a files

00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:45,240
that can be run saying hey this is for

00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:46,860
midi channel 5 okay then from mid eq

00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,560
route this is the bowl of spaghetti time

00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:52,770
go through midi through and midi through

00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:55,410
go from the system into NBA piano a lot

00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:58,830
of these other patches basically go to

00:33:55,410 --> 00:34:01,380
system except for my

00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:03,720
I organ which I went through rock Iraq

00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:08,190
okay so did the customized thing here

00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:15,619
and and that's how that's how we dealt

00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:18,270
with it so just showing you guys some

00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:20,179
some ways around this and again I'll

00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:22,409
place this up on my site don't

00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:24,330
universally take down notes and you can

00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:25,649
always always always will send me an

00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:28,200
email because I like that you know

00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:37,109
artists like to support each other okay

00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:38,940
now getting the sound I've sort of been

00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:42,089
talking about getting the sound but I

00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:45,060
haven't you know you can add in effects

00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:48,300
right that's Keith Emerson right it's

00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:52,290
not like one of my heroes true story i

00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:54,450
was once helping to move the unix based

00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:56,250
system within see art our computers back

00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:59,070
in the 80s and I majus I'm aging myself

00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,839
from an existing five rooms more and one

00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:04,950
of people it was for a security company

00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:07,140
and the guy that was working recently

00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:09,990
hired for the security security company

00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:14,280
with big and his name was he looked like

00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:16,290
you could thrash you huge huge and I've

00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,170
been in a band all you know for since

00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:20,940
high school and when we had to take the

00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:22,740
cables I'm starting to boil them up

00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,270
properly he comes over because it looks

00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,070
like you know something on how to

00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,690
maintain cables in here in advance how

00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:29,369
I'm in a rock and roll band yeah were

00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:31,349
you go saw was the road manager for

00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:33,240
Emerson Lake & Palmer reason to 70s oh

00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:35,400
why did you get out drugs would've

00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,960
killed it's what he said quite literally

00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:42,320
and then what is these the vice pres

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,320
wife's president of was

00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:48,690
our security company for a while 3b you

00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:51,150
know six degrees I'd say more three

00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:52,830
degrees of separation anyways look at

00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:56,490
the packaging here if you want to argue

00:35:52,830 --> 00:36:00,570
with you know jack that it's too

00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:02,670
complicated get real here right so so I

00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:06,600
guess I had to kind of earn my keep here

00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:09,360
right so a song that I like is the who I

00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,710
like anything from the who I won't get

00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,900
fooled again I always wanted to learn

00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:15,240
how to do that intro so the coolest

00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,840
Inglis and the microphones so you know

00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,840
if you do something

00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:28,800
still practicing

00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:59,499
okay good good at the start and it

00:36:57,729 --> 00:37:01,089
fizzled but anyways it doesn't sound

00:36:59,499 --> 00:37:03,309
right for a number of reasons obviously

00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:06,249
the hard thing too is I'm doing staccato

00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:10,150
and that kind of wears out the old arms

00:37:06,249 --> 00:37:13,059
right so now to be honest with you I'm

00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:17,619
rock Iraq is kind of a cool thing it's

00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:19,239
like a whole bunch of patched effects

00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:20,799
that you could add in this is actually

00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:22,660
effects processor from the one of our

00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:24,759
guitarists in their band it's really

00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:26,259
really cool that's a tuner looks like

00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:28,170
Christmas tree that lights up and

00:37:26,259 --> 00:37:31,239
everything like that's kind of cool so

00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:34,299
so one of the things that I did when I

00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:36,039
first launched this stuff was I turned

00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:38,710
off the effects effects can be turned on

00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:42,809
and off by pedal but I'm cheap you can

00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:47,829
do the keyboard as well and this isn't

00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:50,229
this isn't you know it's going to take a

00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:51,880
long time to attempt to master this

00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:54,130
remind me that I have this cranked up

00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:56,489
right I may have the crank it down if

00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,489
it's too

00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,830
long

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,600
doesn't sound exactly the same you don't

00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:44,460
know how many thousands of ways are you

00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,930
was playing around with this to get it

00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:48,870
and eventually I'll get it but that's

00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:51,900
half the fun that's journey right and

00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:54,690
what was it it's basically some blah

00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:56,940
blah because you're setting up an LOL fo

00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:59,220
Wade that's making the staccato for you

00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:01,470
without having to do it like throwing in

00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:03,690
a little bit of an analog phaser and but

00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:05,840
I did turn that off for now Mia sound of

00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:09,360
even cooler a little bit of parametric

00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:12,930
equalization things like that okay so so

00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:18,980
so there you go okay I'm gonna turn that

00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:18,980
back off again okay nearly there

00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,370
learning performance techniques this is

00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,080
kind of a cool this is one that I

00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:26,760
wouldn't have shown or taught and it's

00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,350
like my chief you know I do this and it

00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,560
seems to work for me so maybe I should

00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:32,730
share this with other people so there's

00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,440
a good term here it's actually in

00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:36,090
dictionary it's called woodshed right

00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:39,240
you know that old joke that someone's in

00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:41,930
in New York and they're looking to go

00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:44,340
attend a concert at Massey Hall or

00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:46,380
Carnegie Hall I should say they go up to

00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,700
a New Yorker you know on the street and

00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,470
says excuse me how do you get to

00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:52,980
Carnegie Hall New York their looks up

00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:56,370
and says practice so with shedding you

00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:58,260
hear that all the time it is a per bits

00:39:56,370 --> 00:40:00,390
slang and it's to practice a musical

00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:02,700
instrument assiduously and with special

00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:05,520
goal in mind how do you do this there

00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:08,640
are a whole bunch of ways even creative

00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,800
ways the great ones YouTube and that is

00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,470
accelerated my son's playing like you

00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:18,020
wouldn't believe very very quickly and

00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:20,430
I'm talking drums guitar and keyboards

00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:23,130
he plays Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:25,320
makes our dog he'll make it fool again

00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:29,580
on the piano makes r dot if you want to

00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:31,200
make your dog hell I tell you ok so but

00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,760
you can go further because youtube

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,680
doesn't have everything and yes you

00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,360
should do net searches find out

00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:39,000
information takes a long time but it's

00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:40,010
kind of fun what we've also done and

00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,750
gotten into the

00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:44,630
been doing over the past decade is

00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:46,610
emailing artists and ones that maybe

00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:48,590
have not had work in awhile how far

00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:50,450
their lights aren't as nutty or crazy

00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:52,460
we'll get back to you with things how

00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:55,640
many people here remember the band the

00:40:52,460 --> 00:41:02,690
Canadian band the box the box must I

00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:05,420
always remember wow you guys are young

00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:07,420
okay let's go let's not prolong all the

00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:09,920
time thought they were really cool and

00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:12,590
there's a singer for the box called Jean

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,570
Marc and I sent him an email and just

00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:16,130
questions what are the chords for this

00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:18,020
and he came back I don't do chords on

00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:19,760
the singer right now at least you're

00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,320
honest I kind of like that and you know

00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,790
I can went back back and forth back and

00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,410
forth and asked that there's a song

00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,880
called must I always remembered i really

00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:28,160
like anything was cool what kind of

00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,960
synthesizer you use for that he got back

00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,330
to me he took the time to take a picture

00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:35,060
of it but there was lingus brush it is

00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:37,850
well i have emailed peter tork asking a

00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:40,100
question regarding keyboards course

00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:41,480
Peters too busy but what happened is the

00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,370
person that handled the stuff didn't

00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,310
know the answer so the person emailed

00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:47,690
the Peter 4p mail Peter to get back to

00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:49,130
that person he looking back the

00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:52,720
information I thought I was going to go

00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:55,700
right so sometimes don't be afraid to

00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:59,600
that one's really cool the other thing

00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:01,400
that's kind of cool is that when I did

00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:05,210
the demo for you for won't get fooled

00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:07,370
again in actuality Townsend was taking a

00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:09,800
Hammond organ which is what i was using

00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:12,380
patching it in through an effects

00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:16,160
processor are put 2600 if i'm not

00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:18,350
mistaken that's so kind of cool the big

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,970
one for me is muscle memory how when i

00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:22,280
went all again my mom you know taking

00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:26,450
piano lessons I couldn't like I can read

00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:29,630
music but I'm so slow at it it's not

00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:32,240
even funny so that's not going to work

00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:34,160
for me but what was notices i had an

00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,230
ability for memory so if i learn

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,860
something it could stay in for 10 years

00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:43,760
and i always thought of that this is

00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:45,890
memory my daughter went to a music

00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,350
performance school and said dad it's

00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:50,290
called muscle memory

00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:52,870
officially so consolidating something

00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:54,820
until through repetition till you get it

00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:56,440
right kind of makes sense faster not to

00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:59,590
do this so by the time they do the

00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:02,500
mission it's it's secondhand it's it's

00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:06,030
in their memory so here's a neat trick

00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:10,930
with audacity if you set it to you jack

00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:13,540
you can do this to improve your your

00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:15,190
memory skills so we're nearly there

00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,240
we're nearly finished this thing but i

00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:21,690
want to show you this because i think

00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:30,900
it's it's worth well so i had a an old

00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:33,520
CD of rod Argent's hold your head up and

00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:35,050
transferred it digitally and took out a

00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,400
small little piece that was for the

00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:38,970
organ soul and this is why i have to

00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:45,300
make sure that the volume is down here

00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:45,300
you've probably heard this i love it

00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:50,760
don't play the whole thing it's one

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,920
thing to emulate the sound for rod

00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:55,440
argent it's a totally other thing to

00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:58,200
emulate fraud argued okay and how he

00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:01,320
does stuff so how can i how can I do

00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:05,070
this well with audacity you can select

00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:07,369
the range instead of play you go to Luke

00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:07,369
play

00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,329
then you can start to

00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:33,890
to make a mistake you can start again

00:44:28,509 --> 00:44:52,519
you can go through it and increase it as

00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:55,089
you start to learn what could be too

00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:55,089
many people

00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:16,789
get the idea for the fast sections you

00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:18,619
know there's a program that you can buy

00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:19,910
it it's called the slow gold or

00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:23,890
something like that but there's no need

00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:30,380
to do that you just analyze this section

00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:33,109
yep yep so you can go effect change

00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:42,349
tempo this will do it without changing

00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:54,589
the ancestry sounds weird that's the

00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:57,499
same fish there's probably other ways

00:45:54,589 --> 00:45:59,359
you can analyze frequencies and cut down

00:45:57,499 --> 00:46:01,670
a lot of stuff but it really made mess

00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:03,730
things up other things are there's a lot

00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:06,619
of good care fuel key believe it or not

00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:08,660
midi tracks so the right there that you

00:46:06,619 --> 00:46:09,950
can see how things are done as well what

00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:14,359
I'm saying is that there is no

00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:18,380
limitation to what you can do to win

00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:20,119
 it just requires time that's all

00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,859
Friday night when everybody's gone to

00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:24,859
bed and have the headphones on life is

00:46:21,859 --> 00:46:26,420
beautiful so there's that dealing with

00:46:24,859 --> 00:46:29,269
panic this is really sort of the last

00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:33,319
thing to talk about dealing with panic

00:46:29,269 --> 00:46:36,829
things happen so you know the old panic

00:46:33,319 --> 00:46:39,019
button Rick Houston has been fun I so

00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:40,999
you can click on to it it temporarily

00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:44,720
disconnects things so you can reconnect

00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:49,400
them and and you're on your way worst

00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:53,359
comes to worst reboot so there are those

00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:55,460
things setlist think some things are

00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:59,299
mentioning you want notes to yourself of

00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:01,579
what to do as you're performing live so

00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:04,369
this is an old fashioned setlist not

00:47:01,579 --> 00:47:06,910
very effective the other thing is and

00:47:04,369 --> 00:47:09,529
this is the major cause for panic is

00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:10,730
forgetting the chords to a song when

00:47:09,529 --> 00:47:14,390
your middle playing you got to

00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:16,710
understand our band is probably up to

00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:19,410
five or six sets although we only

00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:22,050
use maybe three sets in an encore they

00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:24,630
keep on putting new songs on which are

00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:27,990
great and I love their taste and life is

00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:31,830
beautiful but I had a fear and it's

00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:35,700
occurred to me sometimes when you forget

00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:37,680
it Cory so I found a way in which i can

00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:41,339
combine these two things together and

00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:44,609
add in what you say to make my life

00:47:41,339 --> 00:47:50,910
easier so having taught HTML a little

00:47:44,609 --> 00:47:53,910
bit of JavaScript i have created my own

00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:59,460
kind of combination cheat sheet set list

00:47:53,910 --> 00:48:01,830
right but also chichi right so lets me

00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:05,150
know what's happening so yeah I could

00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:13,050
put in those little particulars right

00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:18,410
and life is beautiful and the part I

00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:21,510
love about this best is my bandmates are

00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:23,790
playing the guitar and they have a

00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:24,780
little music stand out in front which

00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:26,339
doesn't always look the most

00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,960
professional but I can understand they

00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:30,150
need to do it because sometimes they

00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,950
forget about something and they say me

00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:34,050
here saying oh marie that computer must

00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:38,160
be neat must be regenerating music and

00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:41,339
they don't realize that i'm cheating my

00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:45,030
heart's content right and i find it's a

00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:50,820
very very good fit it works that works

00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:52,619
for me very well so yeah I love this

00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:56,130
right you know I'm not going to quit my

00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:58,470
job again but I love doing this it's a

00:48:56,130 --> 00:49:01,920
lot of fun and these are things that I

00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:04,070
kind of apply all open source as far as

00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:09,599
I know except for the hardware stuff and

00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:14,280
in anyway so a shameless plug if you

00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:17,849
want to see our band perform we're

00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:21,060
playing down at church in richmond at

00:49:17,849 --> 00:49:25,290
McVeigh's tavern second floor around

00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:27,660
nine o'clock there's no cover our band

00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:32,220
has a motto we work for food

00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:34,410
okay I don't know if it's a good model

00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:37,349
but there's that and there's another

00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:42,000
story but remind me to tell you what I'm

00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:44,880
eating and anyways you know i'll post

00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,829
that up so it's ever but you can see me

00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,500
in action with the stuff and we don't

00:49:46,829 --> 00:49:55,260
totally suck actually controller pretty

00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:57,900
good but anyways there's my web page

00:49:55,260 --> 00:50:00,270
address of anything on my journey in

00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:03,150
linux in general there you go so marisol

00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:05,010
wordpress com if you want to go into

00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:07,079
more detail over on the right hand side

00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:09,329
is something called a bunda kubuntu

00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:12,240
linux help that has a lot of really good

00:50:09,329 --> 00:50:15,869
wikis that i placed in but at some point

00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:20,400
in the blog itself i'll i'll post this

00:50:15,869 --> 00:50:23,339
presentation and i'll post up probably

00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:26,130
within the next 24 to 48 hours my shell

00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:28,980
script so you can take a look at okay so

00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:37,410
so anyways thanks for attending today's

00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:39,270
presentation is financially if someone

00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:42,599
can help me take some of this gear to

00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:45,200
the car I think there is someone that's

00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:45,200
task

00:50:53,339 --> 00:50:59,950
british studio does some things to try

00:50:55,839 --> 00:51:04,300
to keep in mind that for example using

00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:08,470
the desktop environment xfce for trying

00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:10,119
to keep things on the on the low there's

00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:12,369
also tricks where you can manage your

00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:18,190
memory as well and these are quite

00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:24,750
abundant on the internet yes oh we

00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:24,750
weren't yes yeah

00:51:28,369 --> 00:51:33,579
large for a higher level up is called

00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:46,640
hard AR do you are it's open source

00:51:42,819 --> 00:51:50,470
order it's like pro tools and I actually

00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:53,660
do have if you go through the Marisol

00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:56,029
wordpress com to go to the boomkin linux

00:51:53,660 --> 00:52:00,140
help under the music section I do have

00:51:56,029 --> 00:52:01,579
quick and simple using our order if

00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:06,950
there's a bit of a learning curve to it

00:52:01,579 --> 00:52:09,650
but it's pretty powerful yeah okay thank

00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:11,960
you very much enjoy your keynote speaker

00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:14,200
