in Seneca but also of the open source

00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:36,130
community worldwide through this portal

00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:39,970
open source communities of projects such

00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:43,209
as fedora our do-over cluster and send

00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,880

that's not focusing on help me the

00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,330
better the open source community you can

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,800
find her working diligently at a sewing

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,440

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,100
more about that malwina is coming my

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:19,550
Bibble take a few orders at any rate

00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:22,410
please join me in welcoming for silly as

00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,940
you can see from the title slider from

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,040
your schedule I want to talk to you

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,780
about makers and that may initially seem

00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,580
strange to some of you and you don't

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,160
know quite yet what that has to do with

00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,380
this event but as Chris mentioned this

00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,750
morning we're here to celebrate 30 years

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,280
of free software but as you also just

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,750
heard I work for red hat and from my

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,430
point of view we've kind of one this

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,720
open-source thing and software what

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,610
would being a billion-dollar company and

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,680
all so what I want to know is what we're

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,269
doing next with open source where do we

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,500
take the things we've learned and how do

00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:53,519
we help make the world a better place

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,630
with all of that beyond software so as

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,040
she mentioned I work on a team called

00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,989
open source and standards at Red Hat

00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,610
what we do is support all of the

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,680
community upstream projects that are so

00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,209
important to Red Hat success but that

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,940
work is really only tangentially related

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,829
to makers I also co-authored a book on

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,450
Raspberry Pi hacks and I've written for

00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:11,489
various websites as she mentioned geek

00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:14,640
mom calm which is just all of the things

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:17,370
geeky and mommy and everything in

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,410
between but most importantly i'm also a

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,570
maker of things my instinct about

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,820
everything is how can i make that thing

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,710
if you can sew it or sculpt it or bake

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,570
it or frost it or solder it or crochet

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,220
or knit it or rivet or dremel iturra hot

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,930
glue it or somehow improve it by setting

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,330
it on fire which is sometimes an option

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,860
I've probably tried it if I haven't

00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,419
tried yet I'm probably going to try it

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,070
tomorrow so if i don't know i already

00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:40,020
know how to do it I'll figure it out and

00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,450
that's why I think of myself as a maker

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,640
but you also are all makers every one of

00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:47,130
you you might not be makers of cakes or

00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,350
of costumes but your makers of code or

00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:51,300
you're a student and you're becoming a

00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,190
maker of things like that maybe maker of

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,919
a data center or something that is a

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,900
cloudy thing or a maker of magic because

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,490
some code fix worked and you don't know

00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,800
why but you're going with it because it

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,479
did work what's important

00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,419
is that you've made something and you're

00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:08,550
all makers of open source so you already

00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:10,139
understand what open source means what I

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,120
want to talk to you about is how the

00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:15,000
makers of tangible things of open

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,680
hardware and open furniture and open

00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,389
prosthetics and all of these things the

00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,460
biohackers and makers of things that we

00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:21,720
don't even know about yet how those

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,250
things have come into being and why the

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,050
maker movement is so popular right now

00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,789
and I hope by the end of this talk I

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,169
have compelled all of you to get

00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:29,580
involved in the maker movement teach

00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:31,590
them all the things you know about open

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,960
source and get beyond the recognizable

00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,219
github accounts and glowing screens and

00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,500
all of that comfort and get out in the

00:05:35,219 --> 00:05:39,659
world and help because you the ones who

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,949
already understands the benefits of open

00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:43,889
source are the ones who are going to

00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:45,780
lead in these new communities now the

00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:47,370
maker movement and open hardware have a

00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,379
different set of challenges from those

00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,969
faced by open software communities there

00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,259
are new sets of legal issues that arise

00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:54,330
when we're talking about open hardware

00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:56,520
projects and communities are unfamiliar

00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,620
with the evolution of openness and how

00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,659
projects work panic a little when

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,490
somebody else uses what they've made or

00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:04,050
when something else is closed their

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,340
project management issues and build

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,569
issues and things that are still the

00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,630
same but a lot of things that are also

00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:12,120
different and a lot of makers are also

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,610
afraid of how you make a profit by

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,169
sharing because of course we the open

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,460
source community and that whole red hat

00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:18,750
billion-dollar company thing have

00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,729
already solved that how you make money

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,919
with open source this is another good

00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:25,500
area in which we can help lead them to

00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:27,029
how it works and just a plug you know

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,550
all of you who are graduating new jobs

00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:31,169
it's good place to be but I'm getting

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,210
the car way out how the horse that's

00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:35,909
sort of the high-level overview so now

00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,770
let's go way back way way back up and

00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:39,960
talk about how this whole makers madness

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:42,330
started in what probably seems really

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,909
sudden but actually is based in human

00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:47,580
history where did the makers come from

00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:48,960
they didn't just spring forth in 2006

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,639
when this word started getting thrown

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,340
about from some sort of primordial goo

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,650
of bondo and liquid solder that let's

00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,000
talk about what a maker is I have a bit

00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,069
of a love-hate relationship with this

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,009
word I love it because it so succinctly

00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:03,569
defines what it means it is a person who

00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:05,759
makes there's a noun for someone who

00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:07,860
makes I hate it because people have some

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,990
preconceived notions about it they think

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,820
of maybe the magazine or they think of a

00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,889
pile of parts and some LEDs or they

00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,740
think of a 3d printer and it is all of

00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:17,139
those things but it

00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,389
so much more and I believe like Dale

00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:21,130
Dougherty who coined the term maker that

00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:23,349
it's not just a pile of parts as a 3d

00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:25,930
printer it's simply what you have made

00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:28,630
it doesn't matter if it's any good it is

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:32,740
simply that you have made something that

00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:34,960
you have created anything once we as

00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,120
humans are makers its intrinsic to our

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,009
existence but there's this path that

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,569
many of us take as individuals that

00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:42,340
actually mirrors the course that we have

00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:43,870
taken as a group over the course of

00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,330
human history so let's look at that

00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:49,030
history first anthropologically speaking

00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,889
going way way back we largely recognize

00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,800
the beginning of humans as the moment

00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:55,900
that we started using tools and while a

00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,639
few other species use simple tools we're

00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,490
the only ones who use those tools to

00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:02,020
make others hul's and then we have the

00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,880
Stone Age which is when Fred Flintstone

00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,680
came along made the whirligig no it's

00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,240
after lunch perk up a little bit no the

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,770
beginning of the Stone Age is the

00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,169
arrival of stone tools of course that's

00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,190
two and a half million years ago and it

00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:13,599
seems like that doesn't have a whole lot

00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,159
to do with makers today but it actually

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,289
does we're going to go on a fast paced

00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:19,539
course through human history so tools

00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:21,250
changed our existence by letting us kill

00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:23,800
things with something besides our teeth

00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,389
it gave us independence and that's the

00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,860
link and i'll talk more about that later

00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:29,620
when i talk about the modern maker

00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,940
movement because before that we were

00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,370
pretty much limited to things that we

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:36,219
could kill with our hands tools changed

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,360
everything so shortly thereafter we

00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:39,099
developed a taste not just for

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,680
functional creation and tools but also

00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:42,820
for art for aesthetics what's one of the

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,320
first things you did when you were a

00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,720
little kid in preschool or art class

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,480
took a handprint put it down you turned

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,860
it into a turkey or something else my

00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,660
kids have made everything with their

00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,940
handprints my time hop just reminded me

00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:58,420
that in preschool they even made but

00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,790
print pumpkins with my infant we we like

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,520
to stamp things with our body parts so

00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,050
much like when you were five the people

00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,000
long long ago started making their

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,190
handprints on the walls this is cueva de

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,660
las manos and argentina where it's ten

00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,760
to twelve thousand year old hand prints

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,680
on the walls and then came better cave

00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,870
art and paintings and carving and

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,640
sculpture things like the Bradshaw

00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,320
paintings in Australia the Wonder work

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,750
engravings and paintings in Africa the

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,850
petroglyphs in valcamonica and then with

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,720
metal tools we develop agriculture and

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,279
machines and evermore

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,019
complicated machines and things that

00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:31,579
eventually took us not only to the

00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:34,189
reaches of the earth but beyond the

00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:35,629
earth and up into the stars and choosing

00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:37,220
this picture on the right was a little

00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:39,680
bit of a bittersweet choice because it's

00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,509
from sts-135 which was the end of the

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,850
American space shuttle program but

00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:46,759
what's actually important is that we

00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:49,160
went from this to this all because of

00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:52,490
that innate spirit to create that is so

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,500
important to us as humans but in order

00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:56,990
for any of that to happen we didn't have

00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,509
to just be makers we also had to be

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,709
shares creatures who are willing to tell

00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:02,300
one another what we had discovered

00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:04,339
whether it was how to turn a stick into

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,720
a spear or how to blow pigment around

00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:07,519
your hand to make that mark on the wall

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,529
and these are my friends that I named

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,149
egg and grog somewhere along the way a

00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:12,980
lot more reason than all of that we got

00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:14,839
egg and grog and at some point I

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,540
imagined OGG turn to grog and said oh

00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:20,029
how you make the hot pit and grog said

00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,649
ah catch your own lighting and I also

00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:22,939
have this theory that egg and grog were

00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:25,069
really good friends until one of them

00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:27,649
wouldn't share how to make the bacon so

00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:29,180
fast wording back onto our timeline how

00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:31,370
that sharing got derailed by something

00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:34,550
besides bacon it got derailed by

00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:37,040
possessiveness and protection so in 500

00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,680
BC and sybaris and Greece they invented

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,059
patents on innovation in luxury these

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,949
Greeks were a lot like me they liked

00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:44,540
food they liked food a lot they liked it

00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:46,730
so much that they gave you a year's

00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,309
worth of protection on some delicious

00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,629
tasty combustible that you had invented

00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:53,509
they actually got really rich off of

00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:55,519
this in the Roman Empire the

00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:57,019
blacksmith's used literal trademarks

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,879
marks of their trade which is where the

00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:00,889
word comes from on their swords they

00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,870
also arguably invented a precursor to

00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:04,639
the the concept of a trade secret that

00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,790
was based around the loss of slaves and

00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,779
what they might tell a new owner and

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,279
then what we assumed to be the first

00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:13,040
copyright battle took a couple hundred

00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:14,990
more years and happened in Ireland st.

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,120
Columba was an Irish Gaelic missionary

00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,189
and one of the twelve apostles of

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,889
Ireland who all studied under this guy

00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:23,899
named st. Finian now Colombo was really

00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,309
well known for pretty much locking

00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:28,220
himself in his room and copying books

00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:30,079
over and over and over again and all the

00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,930
way up to literally the day that he died

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,850
and he would borrow Finian's books copy

00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,949
them for his own personal use assorted

00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,779
Bibles and and various religious works

00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:40,160
and then put them back and this all

00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:40,610
worked out really well until affinion

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,519
notice

00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:45,079
he declared it illegal copying which

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,779
probably sounds a lot like a lot of

00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:50,209
things that you here today so Finian

00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:51,829
goes to the king and because i am really

00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,209
terrible at pronouncing gaelic i like to

00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:55,850
call him King copyright McAfee right

00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:58,279
erson he ruled in Finian's favor saying

00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,200
to every cow belongs its calf to every

00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:03,050
book its owner and so in other words

00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,750
every copy of a book belonged to its

00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,980
original owner this ended into a battle

00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,110
called the Battle of the book which

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,060
killed 3,000 people and had Columba

00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,860
exiled and I am really glad that sharing

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:16,250
mp3 files does not result in 3,000

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:18,260
deaths in less deadly intellectual

00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,670
property news unless they were actually

00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,680
using Cylons the English Parliament

00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:24,050
started requiring Baker's to mark their

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,300
bread with their marks in 1266 and

00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:28,010
because I don't also only like food i

00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,600
also like beer one of the oldest

00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:32,329
trademarks is out of low and brow which

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,339
came about in 1383 so as you can see all

00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:36,560
of this started quite a long time ago

00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:38,390
the first true patents came along in the

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,820
15th century in Italy and were awarded

00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:43,130
to the glass blowers in Venice and then

00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,720
England caught on to this idea and they

00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:47,420
wanted to use patents as a way to

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,860
encourage innovation but instead what

00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,630
happened was about five minutes later

00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,800
somebody else invented patent abuse and

00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:55,519
then about five minutes after that

00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,290
somebody invent a patent reform in 1710

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,940
the statute of Anne in Great Britain was

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,130
the first real copyright act as we

00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,930
recognize it trade secret law came into

00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,610
existence in England in the US and the

00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,140
eighteen hundreds and that pretty much

00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,760
brings us up to what you recognize his

00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,320
intellectual property laws today I know

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,730
that was a really fast trip through

00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,500
history and a budget all came along with

00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,850
me on it because it sets me up for what

00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,640
I want to talk about for the rest of

00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:18,199
this which is makers now so let's talk

00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,680
about how we went from a history of

00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:23,540
sharing in order to eat and survive to

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,380
an exploding system of protection and

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:29,420
this and let's think about that on the

00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,670
scale of one person's life instead of

00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,800
over humanity when you're a little kid

00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,600
the first thing that your parents taught

00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,490
is to share with others especially if

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,800
you had siblings or friends in the

00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,540
neighborhood for pete's sake give that

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,100
kid your toy I have a nine-year-old the

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,500
six-year-old is all we talk about is

00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,360
sharing but the adults teaching that

00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,279
lesson seem to have completely forgotten

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,620
it themselves so they want longer

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,030
copyright terms and more protection and

00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,830
more

00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,720
and supported and shrouds and secret see

00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:57,310
around what they've created they want

00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,410
the bacon they're no different from AG

00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,790
and grog fighting over the bacon so

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,320
eventually they'll both make fire and

00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,190
one day the fire is going to launch into

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,290
the moon but they would have gotten

00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,360
there a lot faster if I could simply

00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:11,050
told grog how to make the bacon we all

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,550
got how to party a lot faster so now we

00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,230
spent centuries trying to squirrel away

00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,790
our secrets to protect what we've

00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,050
created until we think that they're in a

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:19,300
state that we would like to share them

00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,890
which probably means created so there is

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,260
difficult as possible for someone else

00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:25,570
to reproduce we've invented this concept

00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,670
of luxury brands and a need for them and

00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,590
we've created this culture of consuming

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,030
and disposing instead of creating and

00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:33,430
rebuilding which is what the maker

00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,980
movement is about the maker movement is

00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:38,560
the slice of humanity that here in 2015

00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:41,500
has said I'm kind of done with that it's

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,570
enough because people didn't just start

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,610
creating and sharing again when somebody

00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:46,840
slapped the term maker on it it's always

00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,850
been a thing there have always been

00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,590
crafters and creators and tinker's and

00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,840
sharing it was simply what you did for a

00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,490
very long time you mended your clothes

00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,520
you fixed your television when it broke

00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:59,830
but it was because you could things were

00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,810
repairable you could access the tools in

00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:04,330
the parts and the things you needed to

00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:07,120
be a maker and then things increasingly

00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:08,980
closed up until we arrived at this and I

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,090
often come across as an iPhone hater but

00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,340
they're just a really easy

00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:14,860
representation of this entire culture

00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:16,450
this is the seemingly ubiquitous device

00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,090
in which you can't even change the

00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:20,680
batteries yourself now a lot of you are

00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,810
way younger but if I had told my parents

00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,550
in the 1980s that I really really needed

00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,660
this really really expensive thing and

00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,760
we couldn't even change the batteries

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,560
when they died pretty sure they could

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,530
just laughed that would not have been an

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,120
option on the table so makers of the

00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,160
people who don't want that they're the

00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,440
ones who recognize this need to create

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,390
and to share and to fix and to build on

00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,280
what they already have vintage

00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,840
tomorrow's is the book that really makes

00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,480
this connection between that time of

00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,670
repairable things and and the movement

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,080
that gained momentum around the same

00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,880
time as the maker movement and that's

00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,680
steampunk so if you're not familiar

00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,500
steampunk errs our frequently makers

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,780
there's this huge crossover steampunk

00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,550
errs are it's it's this intersection of

00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,050
sort of technology but in a

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:04,780
steam-powered time there are lots of

00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,540
different definitions but this book

00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,579
talks

00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,589
the simultaneous arrival as connected

00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:11,779
through this common desire to return to

00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:13,399
that time when we owned are things which

00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:15,050
we don't you don't own your things

00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:17,420
anymore and that's why they make motto

00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:20,740
is if you can't open it you don't own it

00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:24,290
and that's the simple truth and so

00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:27,230
getting to a point finally it seems that

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:28,970
by its nature by this spirit the maker

00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,250
movement would be open by default that

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,680
it is already inclined to be open source

00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,269
intentionally sharing intentionally

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,579
creating derivative works and building

00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:39,949
on one E and one another but the truth

00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:41,449
it seems is actually quite the opposite

00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:43,730
and I fear growing in the wrong

00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:45,410
direction but there's this growing

00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,490
awareness in phos communities about the

00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:48,889
maker movement and that's what I'm

00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:51,800
trying to help spread in fact Linux con

00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:53,360
in 2014 had a VP for a MakerBot which I

00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,800
will get back to in a minute and another

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,209
from the open prosthetics project

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,740
talking we're seeing more of this and I

00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:59,480
would like to see that grow so that the

00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,269
maker movement doesn't die from closed

00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,589
pneus so now most of what's going to

00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:04,939
follow in the next few examples i give

00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,189
you are going to be around open hardware

00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:08,329
and open hardware is not synonymous with

00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:10,459
makers but it is a really good example

00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:11,659
and particularly accessible for many of

00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:13,220
you who are probably familiar with

00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:16,429
things like artery nose and raspberry pi

00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,630
it's a good reference point so since the

00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:19,429
maker movement makes you think of all of

00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,990
those things will start with open source

00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:22,990
hardware the open hardware movement

00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:25,100
which again sounds open by default in

00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,959
fact open source hardware has a

00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,970
definition just like the open source

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,500
software definition and these freedoms

00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,270
probably look a lot like the freedoms

00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,309
you saw Chris have on his slides this

00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,169
morning it's hardware whose design is

00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:38,210
made publicly available so that anyway

00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:40,159
can study it modify it distribute it

00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,929
make it or sell the design or hardware

00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,520
based on that design and there's an

00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:45,470
entire organization now the open source

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,030
hardware Association they hold a

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:49,040
conference called the open hardware

00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,780
summit which I first attended and I

00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,130
think 2012 it was about the third year

00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:56,480
they had held it they had people like

00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:58,429
super awesome Sylvia who at the time was

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,080
about 11 years old she has this web show

00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:02,450
for makers where she makes all kinds of

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,159
crazy stuff they had a 77 year old who

00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,659
had created a leaf in a mill for a

00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,360
hundred and fifty dollars from scraps

00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:10,340
they had if you've ever seen the the

00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,230
project where they sort of hacked the

00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,100
cockroach to control him which is freaky

00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,440
and if you haven't seen it you should

00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,610
google it up and so I was interested in

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,660
all these projects and thought that

00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,520
there would be this huge

00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,860
open source connection and so I went and

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,050
I wrote about it for open source com and

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:27,230
this is the headline that I wrote after

00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:28,880
that conference because this was sort of

00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,310
the optimistic version of how I felt

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,620
after that event this was not a culture

00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:35,780
of open by default but one of opened by

00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,160
accident it was people who shared

00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,330
because it was the internet age and that

00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,740
was just sort of what you did you put

00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,140
your stuff online it wasn't that they

00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,190
had consciously chosen to be open it was

00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,620
just sort of this thing that they were

00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,390
doing by accident and openness has to be

00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,220
intentional it does not work if you just

00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:52,970
kind of once in a while put something on

00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:54,740
the internet so the keynote that day was

00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:57,110
Chris Anderson who at the time was

00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,150
editor-in-chief of Wired magazine and he

00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,310
started off really well I had a lot of

00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,720
hope he said everything I've learned is

00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,610
I built my own business is because

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,680
people shared what they knew and then he

00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,000
said I don't think we should be dogmatic

00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,860
we should consider some other

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,300
possibilities and then he talked about

00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,130
the limitations of open hardware

00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,050
concluded that the only possibility was

00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,360
alternatives like maybe releasing only

00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:18,740
your schematics or a conditional license

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,420
with restrictions on commercial use

00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,980
which in truth is the direction that

00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,900
open hardware has kind of been going

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,210
ever since because one of the other

00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:29,000
talks that day was bre pettis this guy

00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,950
who was the co-founder of MakerBot you

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,530
guys familiar with MakerBot nods yep

00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:35,500
it's probably the the 3d printer that

00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:37,670
you first saw the first one that you saw

00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,870
everybody loves 3d printers right the

00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:41,330
first time I heard of a 3d printer

00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:43,210
self-replicating printers that was kind

00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:46,520
of my we live in the future a moment

00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:49,430
absolutely where's my hoverboard but the

00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,860
3d printer that that really made a

00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:53,990
takeoff was the MakerBot and it started

00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,640
off really well in 2011 bre pettis was

00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,860
talking to everybody who would listen

00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,040
about how absolutely critical openness

00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:02,390
was openness was absolutely all that we

00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,130
needed to make the future a good place

00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,690
but in the week of that open hardware

00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:07,580
summit in 2012 he announced that the

00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,500
MakerBot two would be closed up in a

00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,230
shiny metal box and nothing open about

00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,540
it really anymore but despite that

00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:16,580
sealed up box because I am an optimist I

00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,950
like to look at what MakerBot did leave

00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:21,440
us and that's a community a community of

00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:23,510
thousands of designers and engineers who

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,040
are still sharing designs and making 3d

00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:27,770
printing more accessible on Thingiverse

00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,360
which came out of MakerBot this is what

00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:31,100
it's all about is the community and

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,330
there's still plenty of

00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,580
these who are doing in the open source

00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:36,530
way and doing so successfully lulzbot is

00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,240
a fully open source 3d printer company

00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,530
they're not cheap but they are really

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,250
good and if you want a self-leveling

00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:45,950
printer that's the secret then earlier

00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:48,440
this year Along Came autodesk this is

00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,299
the Autodesk ember and it's going to

00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,380
take a second for this massively long

00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:52,520
gift to load so I'm going to go ahead

00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,440
and click it while I talk to you about

00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,210
it if you haven't seen it it's a digital

00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,770
light processing printer oh there's the

00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,539
magic you could watch this gift on loop

00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:04,549
forever and so it rises from the resin

00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:07,190
it's kind of magical I could watch it

00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:08,960
over and over again now they explicitly

00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:10,039
said when they launched this back in

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,270
March so they didn't intend it for

00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:12,710
consumers because it comes with a six

00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,630
thousand dollar price tag that is not

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,490
for most people a consumer level price

00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:18,230
point what made the Autodesk amber

00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:21,590
really exciting is that they said that

00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:25,070
they were going to open the CAD designs

00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:26,690
and the material for the the resin and

00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,470
they said that they were doing it

00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:30,200
because it was a market opportunity

00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:32,120
because analysts expect that 3d printing

00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,610
will be a 16 billion dollar market by

00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,559
2018 and because right now that's what

00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:38,210
3d printing looks like somewhere

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,280
depending on who you ask in which

00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,559
printer you have 3d printing has a 25 to

00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,850
a 75-percent failure rate you make lots

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,960
of pretty things like that there are a

00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,850
couple of really great flickr groups

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,789
called 3d print fails they sometimes

00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:52,669
look really cool autodesk wanted to do

00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:54,679
something about that and so while some

00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:57,080
people were skeptical back in march here

00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:58,490
in october they have in fact open to the

00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,799
things that they said they would they

00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,880
released polar resin 48 PR 48 it's

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,530
called because it was their 48th

00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,929
formulation under a Creative Commons

00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:08,030
share-alike license things like this

00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:09,230
give me a lot of hope but I degress

00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,760
let's go back to that open hardware

00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:12,409
summit because there was something else

00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,669
I saw that I thought was a lot more

00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:14,960
important than brief how does telling a

00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:17,570
roomful of open people that he decided

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,159
to go closed from both the presenters

00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:21,890
and the attendees there I heard the same

00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:23,870
stories over and over again openness was

00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,390
for convenience it wasn't a feature it

00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:28,520
was not a room of Linux users it was a

00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:30,470
room of shiny max and some windows users

00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,090
they really basically were completely

00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:35,480
unaware that open source software even

00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:37,940
existed surely there after I started

00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,159
going to the World Maker Faires and the

00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:43,090
three big ones are New York Bay Area and

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,710
Detroit and it was a rich

00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,450
only a really exciting place full of

00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,070
people who are really excited to share

00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,570
and to show you what they had made and

00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:52,930
to talk to you about how they did it and

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:54,490
your local Mini Maker Faires are still a

00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,740
really good place to find a lot of that

00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,990
but over the last few years there's been

00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,370
the subtle but important change and what

00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,650
is taglines the greatest show-and-tell

00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:04,150
on earth I feel like it's kind of become

00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:06,940
the greatest show and sell on earth

00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:08,980
because now when I go up to people at a

00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,720
maker faire and I say can you tell me

00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,670
about your project does this use open

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,790
hardware just do you use open softer

00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:18,010
what are you working on they say I can

00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:19,990
sell you one and to me that's not the

00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:22,420
spirit of a maker and that shouldn't be

00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:24,130
the spirit of a maker faire they want to

00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:26,080
make a profit now and they don't see the

00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:27,670
link that both options are possible that

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,870
you can be open and you can still make

00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:31,080
money and that you can still be

00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:33,550
successful doing things the open way

00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,140
there's a big difference between this

00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:37,320
sort of booth which is the radio shack

00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:39,340
learn to solder booth at a maker faire

00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,110
moment of silence radio shack which

00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:44,470
technically still exist in the US but in

00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:46,210
a sad shell of its former self sparkfun

00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,620
also runs these learn to solder abuse at

00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,870
Maker Faires and does lots of other

00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,270
really great projects with groups little

00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:53,800
LED projects and then there was a

00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:55,210
sponsor booth at maker faire that almost

00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,980
single-handedly made me start thinking

00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:59,350
about all of this and probably led to

00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,490
this talk in the end and it was so

00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,810
shameful that I couldn't find anything

00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:03,880
but a press release about the fact that

00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:06,370
it existed and that was the Purina booth

00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:09,160
I still am really fuzzy on what Purina

00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:11,050
has to do with makers they were letting

00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,270
you fold a piece of card stock into a

00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,500
mouse for your cat to get food out of

00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:17,680
which i think is a really good way to

00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:19,840
make your cat eat paper so anyway it's a

00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,120
title change but i think there's still

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,130
time to turn it because makers do

00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,390
believe in innovation and fundamentally

00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:27,250
they believe in the same things that we

00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:30,010
believe in an open source they believe

00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:32,140
in solving problems sharing ideally

00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,120
doing it openly but most importantly a

00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,800
greater result for everyone else in the

00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,140
end and so what we have to do is show

00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:41,560
them how openness and sharing are the

00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:43,270
way to that greater result so first

00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,830
let's talk about that basic problem that

00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:46,360
people who don't understand open-source

00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:49,330
are distressed by it's what caused bre

00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:51,070
pettis to seal up the MakerBot clones or

00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,570
you know somebody took my thing and

00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:55,770
mated their own thing or somebody took

00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:57,270
my Jango Fett and no right so

00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:58,800
as evidenced by having a book on the

00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,480
thing I may spend a lot of time talking

00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,770
about the Raspberry Pi and I know a lot

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,020
of you are intimately familiar with the

00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:05,940
Raspberry Pi now it is unfortunately not

00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,980
a hundred percent open hardware because

00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,600
of that broadcom SOC but it's close

00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,880
enough that it's a really great example

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,620
for this purpose and because of all this

00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,850
time I spent talking about pies I do not

00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,610
go to any conference that someone

00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:20,250
doesn't say have you seen the fruit pie

00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:22,890
there are so many clothes if you can

00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,720
name a fruit there is a pie for it and

00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:26,640
especially once the Raspberry Pi compute

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,870
module came out which was the the

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,210
compute on module version with the

00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:32,520
companion baseboard there are gobs and

00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:33,990
gobs of clones of this thing sometimes

00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,640
they're just pie software compatible

00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:38,370
sometimes they add on some more RAM

00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,690
they're often not $35 which hello is the

00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,660
main appeal of the pike is not like a

00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:45,210
fast computer on the planet but his any

00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:47,310
of this harming pie sales did anyone try

00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:50,310
to buy a pie to when they first went up

00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:52,110
for sale did you get one that day how

00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:55,860
did that go for one guy what guys like

00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:57,660
yeah the 1x who does knew it was rough

00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,640
going for a while none of those clones

00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,500
are hurting the Raspberry Pi in any way

00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,760
whatsoever because it is a solid project

00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,400
with a solid plan that knows what it's

00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,630
doing and a solid community by it and if

00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,370
somebody makes an improvement on it

00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:10,440
that's the open-source way that's

00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:12,090
innovation that means that it's your job

00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,970
as the original project creator to keep

00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:16,740
improving so one area that would

00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:19,260
probably be really happy for the success

00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,540
of being cloned is the open prosthetics

00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:23,490
and there are several different projects

00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,780
in this area it's one of those ways in

00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,130
which bringing open source to maker

00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:28,440
communities can have a seriously

00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:30,030
life-changing impact on someone we build

00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,440
a lot of silly things with raspberry

00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:34,230
PI's and there are some really important

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,090
projects but open prosthetics are really

00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:38,370
really important to a lot of people and

00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:39,870
the open prosthetics project is exactly

00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:41,370
what its name says they're working on

00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,870
building better prosthetics for people

00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:44,280
the open-source way including the

00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:46,920
hardware and the software and the

00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,630
firmware prosthetics are expensive and

00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,160
they have to be individually fitted it's

00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,720
a relatively small market which means

00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,030
it's hard to capture venture capital it

00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:57,150
is the perfect place for open source to

00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:58,470
solve a problem and for those of you who

00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,550
have open source projects and you don't

00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:01,050
know how to gather contributors they

00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,640
have a really good example on their

00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:04,620
website this is straight up on their

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,910
homepage specifically telling you how

00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,320
you can contribute in different ways

00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:09,730
that aside

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,279
my favorite stories from their site is

00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:14,860
an evidence of one of the fantastic

00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:16,450
benefits of open source that's really

00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,490
really evident maker communities and

00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:21,250
what the maker movement is changing and

00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:23,139
that is accessibility and not in a

00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:25,539
prosthetic sense but accessibility to

00:27:23,139 --> 00:27:28,809
participation this is a group of kids

00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:30,669
this is a 2011 lego firstly group in

00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:32,169
Oregon and they knew someone who had

00:27:30,669 --> 00:27:33,880
been born without arms but she really

00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:36,250
wanted to swim with arms and so they

00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:39,880
spent their project creating arms for

00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:42,190
her to swim with and then the next the

00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,980
next area that is really useful for all

00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:47,200
of this is security in both the hardware

00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,840
and the software and this is an

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,610
opportunity for openness to make a huge

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,230
difference in the hardware community in

00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,820
the maker community so I don't know if

00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:57,159
any of you have ever heard Karen Sandler

00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:58,809
who used to be with the you know

00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:02,879
foundation and now she works for the

00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:02,879
software freedom Conservancy software

00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,029
conserving talk that I consider to be

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,279
the most compelling evidence for the

00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:10,960
importance of open source and it has to

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,789
do with the hack ability of implanted

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,590
medical devices in her case of pacemaker

00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:16,929
if you watch the show elementary there

00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:19,629
was a first season episode story about

00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:21,429
someone who was murdered by having his

00:28:19,629 --> 00:28:23,620
pacemaker hacked and it's not a story on

00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:25,840
a TV show it is actually realistically

00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:27,340
possible a third of the medical devices

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,799
with software sold in the united states

00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:32,529
between 1999 and 2005 where we're called

00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:34,750
a third of them if you go look up

00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:36,070
Karen's talk there is some really

00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,299
interesting stuff from the medical

00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:39,340
device security center about how

00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:41,769
ridiculously simple hacking these

00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,750
devices is what kind of information they

00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:45,669
have on them and what you can do to them

00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:48,789
there have been multiple vulnerabilities

00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:51,370
found in devices that range from sending

00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:54,100
45 days worth of insulin at once into a

00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:56,940
person to sending at 830 volt lethal

00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:59,529
shock into a person from 50 feet away

00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:02,139
it's certainly not a new problem even

00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:04,419
just buggy code not even crackers have

00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:07,419
been responsible for many deaths as far

00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:09,940
back as the 1980s six people died from a

00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:10,960
radiation therapy machine several

00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,399
hundred people have died in the last

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,429
five years from those drug infusion

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:18,970
pumps it's a big problem and none of

00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:21,510
that is open software and what we need

00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:23,430
is openness for these devices

00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:26,070
the hardware for the software and that

00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:27,300
means audit whether it's for intentional

00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:29,820
unintentional vulnerabilities or

00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,830
intentional back doors and spying and at

00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,870
least in the United States the FDA is

00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:35,370
I'm going to say simply not that

00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:37,140
interested you are not required to

00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:40,410
submit the code for your device for

00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:42,450
review you can offer it for review which

00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:45,720
is not the same thing at all so we've

00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:47,850
seen what happens with DRM we've seen

00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,860
what happens with you know basic things

00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:52,410
to our lives like books and movies and

00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:54,300
music it's so much more important when

00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:57,540
it comes to whether it's a device that

00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:59,250
could kill you we now we've seen what's

00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:01,590
happening with unaudited software I

00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,030
happen to own a TDI jetta that I'm not

00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:06,030
really excited about the next month or

00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:06,990
two for and over the last year we're

00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:09,120
hearing more and more about these

00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:11,010
insecurities and networking and in other

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,280
hardware earlier this year Lenovo had

00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:17,310
the little superfish adware / malware /

00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:20,490
vulnerability installer problem and even

00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:22,350
in New York Times op-ed piece in 2013

00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:24,210
was pointing at open hardware is the key

00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:25,830
to a more secure internet now 10 years

00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:27,660
before that the New York Times being the

00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,310
one champion open-source software open

00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,960
source hardware we're just sounded crazy

00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:34,230
the New York Times is on our side now

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:37,470
stop everybody else to catch up how many

00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:39,150
of you have heard of the novena a couple

00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:40,620
of nods of recognition it's a really

00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:42,060
great example of a project trying to

00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,410
fight all of these battles it was

00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:46,080
created by the guys who created the

00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:48,210
chumby which was this fun little hack

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,100
friendly linux-based alarm clock and

00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,690
lots of other things which has been

00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,860
discontinued but because openness is

00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:54,060
awesome it still wakes me up every

00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:56,070
morning with just about anything I

00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,450
wanted to wake me up with and so the

00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,730
novena was designed with full

00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:01,980
transparency in mind including security

00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:03,960
it was created by these two guys one of

00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,460
them's named bunny bunny previously

00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,550
found enjoyment in his life by

00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:11,060
publishing xbox hacks and he made every

00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:13,980
trace on the pcbs himself the hard way

00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:15,690
it's it's not a hundred percent open as

00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,850
we see with other open hardware projects

00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:20,370
as some bits like the screen are off the

00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:22,080
shelf but it's about as open as you get

00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:27,090
as far as the laptop goes it runs off of

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:29,670
an RC car battery as an aside bunny and

00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:31,800
no starch press release this book called

00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:33,510
hacking the Xbox that as I mentioned he

00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,309
was into that sort of project and they

00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:37,679
released it free as an e-book and honor

00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:39,659
aaron swartz even if asking the xbox is

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,999
not at all of importance to you if you

00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:43,620
go to no starch calm / xbox free you can

00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:45,360
read the letter that he wrote announcing

00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:47,519
it which talks a lot about the

00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,289
importance of all of this and and you

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,029
can see from the quote there the risk of

00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:52,499
becoming enslaved by our technology and

00:31:51,029 --> 00:31:55,950
how important it is to have the right to

00:31:52,499 --> 00:31:57,899
hack and the right to open which brings

00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:59,159
us to the next and perhaps most obvious

00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:00,749
challenge that's a bit different for the

00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:02,759
maker community as I mentioned earlier

00:32:00,749 --> 00:32:04,590
in the talk and that is the legal issues

00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:06,090
they face which could be an entire talk

00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,080
all on its own and I am NOT a lawyer but

00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,029
it's too important not to at least

00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,499
mention unlike software which is

00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:12,659
protected by copyright the minute you

00:32:10,499 --> 00:32:14,879
start typing it hardware has a whole

00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:17,070
other bundle of legal questions first of

00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:18,419
all there's licensing yeah you guys

00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:20,070
understand I think for the most part

00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:21,659
what licensing mean work means when it

00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:23,610
comes to code but when it comes to

00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:25,259
hardware copyright can still apply to

00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:27,990
the design files but not to the object

00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:30,330
itself and while patents might still be

00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:31,830
relevant largely you'll be facing a lack

00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:33,840
of protection when you start talking

00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:35,399
about open hardware and so there are two

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,409
major licenses intended for open

00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:38,759
hardware the tapper open hardware

00:32:37,409 --> 00:32:40,289
license and the CERN open hardware

00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:42,059
license if you're interested in the

00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:43,440
finer details of all of this I suggest

00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:45,269
looking up this paper by andrew katz

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,860
towards a functional license for open

00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:49,139
hardware it's about two or three years

00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:50,519
old now but still quite relevant this is

00:32:49,139 --> 00:32:52,860
a learning curve but a lot of decisions

00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:54,539
to make for example some people choose

00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:56,039
to simply open and license the design

00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:59,039
files instead of worrying about the

00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:00,059
hardware there's a lot to sort out and I

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,999
mentioned the open-source Hardware

00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:05,879
Association if you go to OS hwa org oh

00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:07,889
look I have a URL for you / faq they

00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:10,499
explain a lot of the details about this

00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:11,909
if that's your interest area if that is

00:33:10,499 --> 00:33:13,320
your interest area definitely get

00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:15,210
involved because this is one of those

00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,879
places where the hardware can be you

00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:19,230
could use a lot of help so we definitely

00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:21,600
need to work to figure out these issues

00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:23,340
and the legal issue the legal arena is

00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,139
particularly hairy for those prosthetics

00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,549
and for medical devices because not only

00:33:25,139 --> 00:33:28,350
do you have the regular open hardware

00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:29,850
problems to deal with but also the

00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,350
medical legal complications because

00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:33,539
again you're dealing with whether or not

00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,679
people die and that's not even its own

00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,940
talk that's actually an entire other

00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,889
conference but i want to point it out

00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:41,159
because it is a huge hairy problem for

00:33:37,889 --> 00:33:42,600
them but fundamentally wrapping this all

00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:44,580
up regardless of any of these problems

00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,529
it's important to remember that much

00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:49,170
like the community that's left of that

00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:51,240
once open baker-bots you can always have

00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,470
that you always have that community you

00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,510
always have the sharing because that's

00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:56,340
what's important is those people working

00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:58,080
together so if you don't have a

00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,870
community yet where do you find a

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,630
community your local hackerspace this

00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:05,040
one is from Belgium and there's a bit of

00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:06,960
debate over whether we call these map

00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,850
maker spaces or hackerspaces it's all

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,919
kind of the same concept you guys are

00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:13,290
lucky in Toronto to have seven of them

00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:15,270
it used to be that people could tell me

00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:16,710
I don't have a hackerspace that is not

00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:18,300
an excuse here and that's really not an

00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:20,880
excuse and much of the rest of the world

00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,700
either this is just a section of the the

00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:26,220
United States the map on hackerspaces

00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:27,720
org is now limited to 500 locations at

00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:30,390
once you kind of have to zoom down

00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:32,700
pretty far to see anything and some of

00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:33,660
these are focused in specific areas one

00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,380
of the ones that I find the most

00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:39,179
interesting is the bio hackerspace a

00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:41,340
biohacker space is a place that has

00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:43,650
things like pcr machines and DNA

00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:45,270
isolation and centrifuges and incubators

00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:46,440
and microscopes and industrial fridges

00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:48,510
and freezers and all those things that

00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,890
you would find in a bio lab but with all

00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:54,179
the without all the trappings of

00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:56,400
academia a foo kashima disaster spawned

00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:58,080
this open Geiger counter project and

00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,730
this is another one of those examples of

00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,170
people really making a difference in

00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,640
lives because there was not a lot of

00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:04,620
data coming from the government about

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,480
where the radiation was and so they were

00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,980
able to hook Geiger counters up to the

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,020
Internet to get accurate radiation

00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,030
readings stream the data all open data

00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:13,410
for anyone to see so the people who

00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:15,030
lived there could have some actual

00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:17,370
factual information about what they were

00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:22,410
being exposed to and what's important

00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:24,390
here is the open data this kid is named

00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:27,720
Jack he was the Intel Science Fair award

00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:29,310
winner in 2013 he developed a test for

00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:32,370
the early stages of pancreatic ovarian

00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:34,560
and lung cancer and what's important is

00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:36,870
that he built all of that on open access

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:40,320
journals and reading them online because

00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:42,990
he was about 14 or 15 at the time open

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,910
data is incredibly critical to each step

00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:47,370
of this journey one of the other things

00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:50,070
I like about this kid is his mom because

00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:51,600
again I have kids and I like to see

00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:53,430
parents getting involved and letting

00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,800
their kids have the freedom to try all

00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:57,630
these things out and when his school

00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,990
made him take home his homemade arc

00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:02,860
furnace his mom who isn't enough

00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:03,970
anesthetist said just don't burn

00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,080
the house or kill yourself or your

00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,310
brother because I don't know enough

00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:11,260
physics and math to know if that's a

00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:12,880
death ray or not I like her so if you've

00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:15,040
never heard me to give a talk before you

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,150
tend to leave with a reading list and

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,680
the first thing we had was vintage

00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:19,510
tomorrow's which is the super fun book

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,060
about makers in steampunk next on the

00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:23,800
list is the maker movement manifesto the

00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:26,770
maker movement manifesto was written by

00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,510
tech shop CEO mark hatch he didn't start

00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:30,670
tech shop but he's been in charge of it

00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:31,840
since about two thousand seven and you

00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:34,000
don't have a tech shop here I don't

00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:38,080
think it's a chain of makerspaces so to

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,030
speak that started in 2006 so mark hatch

00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,880
has a pretty volt bold vision for tech

00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:44,650
shop he says that tech shop has the

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,120
unique opportunity to arm the maker

00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:48,610
movement with the tools it needs to

00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,080
change itself and the world more

00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:52,510
importantly he spends the whole book

00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,980
backing that up so much so that after a

00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:56,530
while it starts to feel repetitive but

00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:58,540
they are really fun stories and some of

00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:00,580
them are huge success stories TechShop

00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:03,580
hatch square the credit card payment

00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:06,400
system dodocase and both of these are

00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:08,170
good stories of how failing fast one of

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,330
those fundamental tenets of open source

00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:12,820
leads to success quickly and how

00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:14,170
building something in a tech shop lets

00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,640
you interact with other people who are

00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,990
building something else interesting that

00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,460
might help your project and you could

00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:21,400
help them and all of the open-source

00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:23,710
magic happens but i have to tell you my

00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,780
favorite story from the whole book hatch

00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:27,010
is walking around his local tech shop

00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,750
one day and he runs into this

00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:31,510
middle-aged guy who's working on what he

00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:34,030
describes as a poorly constructed clunky

00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:37,320
aluminum block like structure and he

00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:39,370
says hello what are you working on and

00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:42,190
middle-aged guy with this weird-looking

00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:44,740
devices i'm working on a desktop diamond

00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:46,300
manufacturing device because he wanted

00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:48,280
to make a diamond ring for his wife and

00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:51,580
i don't mean like a diamond entering i

00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:53,080
mean a ring made of diamond and so hatch

00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:55,510
already thinks he might be a little bit

00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,520
crazy and then he says it's cool all i

00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,600
need to do is rip the magnetron out of

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,710
this microwave to make the necessary

00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:05,220
plasma ball it turns out the crazy Mike

00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:07,030
and his diamond plan is actually a

00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,980
physicist who works in a diamond

00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:10,960
deposition tool company who has the

00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:14,170
experience and he thinks he's actually

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,970
going to do this what's important is not

00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,690
whether or not Mike actually succeeds

00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:18,220
and I really

00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:19,300
he did because the book never gets to

00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,650
that point I imagine he was still

00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:23,140
working on it when the book went to

00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:25,240
print what's important is that his

00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:29,290
industry experience told him that to try

00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:31,750
this would cost $80,000 techshop it cost

00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:33,220
him a thousand dollars thanks to all of

00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:37,030
the tools and resources they had their

00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:39,490
that is an industry changing factor of

00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,839
magnitude other stories from tech shop

00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:43,869
talk about things that used to cost

00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:46,900
months or years and time now cost a week

00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:49,300
or days when you're talking about going

00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:52,150
from your life savings and a year of

00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:54,369
work to your quarterly bonus and a week

00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:56,859
of work that's the sort of change that

00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:58,960
can completely shift how rd and

00:38:56,859 --> 00:39:01,319
manufacturing in the entire way we bring

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,849
tangible goods into existence work in

00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:06,430
the openness and sharing of that process

00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:09,339
are the critical pieces to how it all

00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:10,900
happens so now we found our simplified

00:39:09,339 --> 00:39:13,030
path to market we know that we can

00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:16,180
change people's lives with better what

00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:18,490
comes after that making money we're back

00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:20,200
to that everyone always wants to make

00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:21,490
money because once they see one project

00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,859
do it once they see the billion dollar

00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:25,569
open source company they want to do it

00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:27,190
too and I don't blame them because this

00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:30,010
whole making stuff hobby is super

00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:32,500
expensive I know and so that's why a lot

00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:34,240
of them turned to crowdfunding these are

00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,829
a few of the highest funded crowdfunding

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,150
projects in history all of them made

00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:40,140
even more than the Veronica Mars movie

00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:42,369
which was pretty astoundingly successful

00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:43,780
if you're familiar with the concept of

00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:46,420
crowdfunding it's probably through

00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:48,310
Kickstarter or IndieGoGo which a lot of

00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:50,050
people see as a shopping mall and that

00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:52,180
is not what this crowdfunding thing is

00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:54,069
about there's a really great documentary

00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:56,740
called maker about the economy around

00:39:54,069 --> 00:39:59,369
the maker movement and in fact maker the

00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:01,300
movie was crowdfunded itself

00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:02,829
crowdfunding is really cool because it

00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,810
lets you build a customer base without

00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:06,460
having a whole bunch of product already

00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:08,349
on the shelf waiting to go unless you

00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:10,960
have an early proof-of-concept reduced

00:40:08,349 --> 00:40:12,760
risk and market your idea but it also

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,530
forces you to do a little realistic

00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,060
research and planning especially the

00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:17,560
older these services get and the more

00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:19,390
restrictions they put on the people who

00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,400
use the services because writing on a

00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:22,599
napkin at a bar I'm sorry students it's

00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:26,109
not actually how you make a business

00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:28,030
plan sorry crowdfunding can also be

00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:28,420
deceptive and that people think it's a

00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,890
million

00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,660
times easier than traditional methods

00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:33,070
which it can be but it is not a

00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,240
one-click mail your stickers make a

00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:37,090
million dollars kind of way to a

00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,370
business and again it is not a shopping

00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:41,320
mall as a backer I think of it you're

00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:43,660
more like a renaissance patron of the

00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,310
arts / maker / creators of things

00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:47,140
supporting work that you think is

00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,910
worthwhile which in the end may result

00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:51,300
in you getting some tangible good but

00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:54,010
that's not actually what this is about

00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:55,870
now crowd funding options are spreading

00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:57,550
beyond the Kickstarter model Kickstarter

00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,990
is an all-or-nothing funding model so if

00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:01,000
you ask for ten thousand dollars and you

00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:03,460
get nine thousand you get nothing and

00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,080
I'm sorry you had a bad day and now

00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:07,390
there are new models like bounty source

00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,550
which is offering bounties for problems

00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:11,230
solved wrapped around github there are

00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,060
equity crowdfunding sites that offer

00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:14,290
investors equity in the resulting

00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:17,290
company there are lots of different

00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:19,480
models springing up some people see that

00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:21,910
as a threat to the venture funding model

00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,470
but it's not a one or other kind of deal

00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:25,360
and the smart ones are taking the old

00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:26,860
model and shifting it into the new model

00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,270
and taking the best of both worlds

00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,740
starting with the crowdfunding and

00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:31,750
ending with venture capital and in fact

00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,340
10% of crowd funded projects that past

00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,690
one hundred thousand mark induct with

00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:37,420
formal venture capital at the end of the

00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:39,910
campaign there's definitely room for for

00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:41,620
crossing things and crowdfunding comes a

00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:42,640
lot of benefits beyond the money and not

00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,200
the least of which is reaching your

00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,660
target audience before you actually

00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:49,000
manufacture the project product you get

00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:50,800
user centric design by having your users

00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,870
involved early in the process this is a

00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,550
picture of a laser cutter called the mr.

00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:57,040
beam that i bought for six hundred fifty

00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:58,990
dollars not bought support it on

00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,150
kickstarter for six hundred fifty

00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:02,890
dollars about a year ago and as i am sad

00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:05,140
to admit still in parts on the third

00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:07,420
floor of my house but you get

00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:09,280
information that it's as simple as what

00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:11,140
the most popular color is when you ask

00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,670
for a mr. beam you got to pick what

00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:15,730
color you wanted the 3d parts to come in

00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:17,320
or you get some important very basic

00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,610
fact like how many people actually care

00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,020
about that thing that you want to make

00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:21,250
which is a pretty useful piece of

00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:23,620
information to have if you're trying to

00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:25,480
start a business it's so effective as a

00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:26,590
market test arena that even sony has

00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,790
made a bit of a habit out of

00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:30,070
crowdfunding and it's not because

00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:32,290
nobody's buying the ps4 this was a

00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:33,970
project that they successfully funded on

00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:35,350
indiegogo back about march they asked

00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:38,100
for fifty thousand dollars for this

00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:40,000
project for innovators and got 64,000

00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,160
there's even a crowdfunding

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,750
professionals association now which is

00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,010
that perhaps a good thing because all of

00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:47,560
these money-making schemes are not

00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:48,910
without pitfalls and it helps again if

00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,830
we all are being a community and helping

00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:52,150
one another crowdfunding is not a

00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:53,620
magical solution to turn the brilliant

00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:56,620
idea you had in the bar on your napkin

00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:57,760
into a retirement plan you're not you're

00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:59,500
actually going to have to fulfill your

00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,820
promises in the end it turns out you

00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,590
have to research and plan and this is

00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:04,390
when success becomes the problem it's

00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:06,490
the best problem to have we were too

00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:08,170
successful so order of the stick which

00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:09,730
was this really fun webcomic asked for

00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:11,530
fifty seven thousand dollars to print

00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:14,470
some print copies of the webcomic and

00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:16,750
then they got 1.2 million dollars they

00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:18,430
had 110,000 requests and couldn't

00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:20,680
actually handle them all the printer was

00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:22,660
not able physically to print that many

00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,950
copies of the book at the same time the

00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,650
printer bought another 3d printer

00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:28,990
campaign asked for $25,000 and got 800

00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:31,660
thousand dollars and then the IRS mailed

00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:33,010
him a tax bill for 300,000 dollars there

00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:34,960
are all sorts of problems with the

00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:36,820
especially the early crowdfunding users

00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,170
didn't see coming pebble however

00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:39,700
actually responded pretty well and

00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:44,050
pebble has become a really successful

00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:45,580
company out of it next problem is this

00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:47,290
is an act of burying yourself naked

00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,550
before the people you care about because

00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:49,960
the first person who's going to support

00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:52,450
your crowd funded project is probably

00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,190
your mom crowd funded projects make

00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:55,810
money from this expanding circle of

00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:58,090
people which begins with the people that

00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:59,830
you know and then out to their friends

00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:00,970
and then way off at the end are the

00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:02,050
strangers that you probably actually

00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:05,320
were thinking about when you started

00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:06,910
making your project related you don't

00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,080
get to just post your project and wreath

00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,910
over Awards you still need this

00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,530
well-thought-out plan because terrible

00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:13,180
write-ups don't get money you can go

00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:14,950
surf any of these sites on any given D

00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,910
day and see all kinds of things that did

00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:18,130
get the money they were doing with

00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:19,900
Kickstarter actually only accepts about

00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:22,420
sixty percent of the projects that asked

00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,380
to be listed and you need a marketing

00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:25,180
plan because there are a lot of

00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,470
crowdfunding sites now and nobody's

00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,970
going to magically find your project

00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:30,130
it's there's a lot of stuff out there

00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:32,230
and I mean that to be encouraging not a

00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:33,970
deterrent because crowdfunding is rooted

00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:35,740
in a very open source philosophy and

00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:38,440
that's the one of meritocracy that

00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:41,110
ideally in the end the best ideas win

00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:44,500
and that's why it can be really really

00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:46,420
successful open desk is a project that

00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:49,000
connects designers and makers at the

00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:51,340
point of furniture creation they they

00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,840
are using a hybrid of crowdfunding and

00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,880
more traditional means of raising money

00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,630
so they're using crowdfunding and return

00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,340
for investment

00:44:55,630 --> 00:45:00,040
and an equity stake in the company and

00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:02,380
they have a grant from a group called

00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:04,120
the UK Technology Strategy Board the

00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,430
novena is another example that started

00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:08,680
out as a hobby project and is becoming a

00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:10,450
more successful crowdfunding campaign

00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,700
sort of a oh that worked out sort of

00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:15,460
thing there's sort of cereal project

00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:17,530
creators so we're robbing all this up on

00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:19,210
a good note we have we have ways to

00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:21,100
solve our problems we have legal issues

00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:22,950
that we need to address we know that it

00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:25,690
all comes down to community and sharing

00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:28,030
makers who are open and successful who

00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:29,680
create ecosystems and improve lives are

00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:31,360
the types of makers that we want to

00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,800
encourage and those are the ones who are

00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,570
building their lives on open-source

00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,370
principles and that's where we can help

00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:38,920
is for those who don't understand that

00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:40,750
success model yet and all of you can

00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,640
take all of your open-source ideals and

00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:44,680
go help those maker communities projects

00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,780
for the greater good so let's go back to

00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,250
why all of this matters you're all

00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:50,890
believers in the open source movement I

00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:52,840
assume as you are here and so it can be

00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:54,160
easy for us to forget why openness is

00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,230
important because it become such an

00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,730
innate part of what we do we just open

00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:59,710
sources the right way and so we don't

00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:01,870
even think about it anymore so why does

00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:04,360
it actually matter if these makers are

00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:06,760
sharing what they create it's because

00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:09,820
today's maker is creating tomorrow's

00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:11,410
device and it might be a toy or a piece

00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,880
of clothing or it could be one of those

00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:15,670
prosthetics that really changes

00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,310
someone's life and the person who has

00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:19,960
that creation can now change it they can

00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:22,540
fix it they can make it suit their lives

00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:24,660
better they can make it better or they

00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:27,460
could just replace the batteries and

00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:29,200
then she's become the next maker by

00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:31,570
doing that and then maybe she's going to

00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,400
make an even better version and closing

00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:35,380
up this process at any point in the

00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:38,050
cycle breaks the cycle of innovation and

00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:39,520
makers are at heart innovators and so

00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:42,520
the last thing that we want to do is

00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,930
make a broken cycle of innovation so

00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:46,150
told you about some successes in the

00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:47,170
cycle I showed you the Y in the hope but

00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:48,580
it also told you there are a lot of

00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:49,900
problems and there are problems that

00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:52,120
still don't have solutions yet and

00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:53,800
that's because as I hope you have

00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:56,140
figured out by now you are the solution

00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,420
each of you has a different set of

00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:59,890
skills and strengths and you're likely

00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:01,660
to have strengths and software and code

00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:04,000
but you also have friends who are

00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:05,800
designers or lawyers or good with

00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,390
hardware and not just the software and

00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,420
so what you can do is use your

00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:10,160
experience in

00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:11,900
source to tell all of those other people

00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,930
how this works and how important it is

00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:16,850
and that they can help too because now

00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:18,320
you know the power of the maker and you

00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:20,120
already knew the power of open source

00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:22,610
and now you know the importance of

00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:24,320
creating to humanity and so it's up to

00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:26,840
you as an open source software community

00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:28,580
who have seen for far longer the success

00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:30,590
of openness and how much more successful

00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:32,270
does than the alternative to go become a

00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:33,770
part of these maker communities the open

00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:35,660
hardware movements and the tangible

00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:37,070
goods beyond them and to share with them

00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:38,840
what you've learned because you all

00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:40,760
believe in open and you are all makers

00:47:38,840 --> 00:48:05,870
so go forth and make things better

00:47:40,760 --> 00:48:07,730
thanks any questions so since you

00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:11,390
pointed out that my problem actually

00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:14,330
with the the laser cutter is one of time

00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:15,950
and documentation because it was made by

00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:18,230
a bunch of Germans and so their

00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:19,700
documentation as a 60-page PDF mostly of

00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:23,240
pictures and a few badly translated

00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:24,800
words of English and so that I ran out

00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,510
of time Trey I've down the very last

00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,130
step like I'm at the end point of just

00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:30,290
plugging those wires together and I have

00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:31,370
found the time to do that but anyone

00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:32,690
who'd like to come over my house and

00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:40,810
