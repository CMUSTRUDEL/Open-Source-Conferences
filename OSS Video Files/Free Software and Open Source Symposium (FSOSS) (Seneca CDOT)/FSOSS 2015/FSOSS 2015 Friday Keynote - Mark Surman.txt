yes sir it's like to welcome you to

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:07,319
today's keynote is me a lot of pleasure

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,320
to introduce a friend personal friend

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:14,389
friend to Seneca we're all so different

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,640
open source and when Mark sermon is

00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:21,630
Zilla foundation and I was trying to

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,119
think about when I actually sort of work

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,939
in the Parker when I had at night it's

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,890
been a long time Finn he neither work

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,590
together on stuff since about two

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:35,940
thousand seven thousand crap 2006-2007

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:38,760
and talk probably about two deputies

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,489
were working on an open source but when

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,430
I first met he was thinking about open

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,649
source and open education and I think

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,110
show with foundation at the time and

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:52,559
people I stay true to the group so a lot

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,920
of his work has been context of Mozilla

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,449
thinking about how do you enable

00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:01,920
communities and networks of we want to

00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:05,189
think about the open web think about how

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,900
to bring that to another generation how

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:08,580
do you teach that how do you spread that

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,740
around the world he's had a really good

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,650
vehicle if you got this role at the

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,509
foundation and traveling the world and

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,299
really building a lot of excitement for

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,939
the open web and open source in general

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,400
so I'll introduce him now please help me

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:27,870
in welcoming mark as in talks to us this

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,330
morning okay

00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,460
thanks Dave and Chris can you give me a

00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,930
like I'm going to try to talk for about

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,000
half an hour's and maybe give me a five

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,860
minutes at 25 minutes and we'll try to

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,100
have time for questions we'll see how it

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:44,540
goes so thanks for the kind welcome and

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:49,020
thank you guys for having me here hello

00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:51,420
thank you Chris as you know that the

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,630
theme is 30 years of freedom which

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,960
really that was 2013 when the the new

00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:01,200
public license turned 30 so on that

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,470
theme of 30 years of feed 3m that on

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,640
that theme I got to get talking here

00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:08,130
Chris Laura gave me that as something to

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,800
riff on so i started with 30 years of

00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,390
freedom as my theme and then I kind of

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,160
had a couple glasses of wine at dinner

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,070
last night here at the speaker's dinner

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:21,270
I realize that was not ambitious enough

00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:24,000
so today's talk is entitled 350 years of

00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,270
freedom which is I think what we are

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,590
going to try to build here together and

00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:31,590
before i get into the talk i want to

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,270
just do a couple quick polls so how many

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,730
people here are in some way involved in

00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,500
free software and open source ok that's

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,850
there's people here or not you're either

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:45,000
lazy or you're in the wrong conference

00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:46,320
and how many people you know there's a

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,610
lot of pragmatic reasons for being

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,739
involved in in free software an

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,900
open-source you just if you're here here

00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,400
in Kieran and Gideon talk there's

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,930
economic reasons there's you know

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,430
open-source lets you get ahead by

00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,470
leveraging other people's codes there's

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,780
lots of reasons but for me there's also

00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,550
values reasons so another poll how many

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,720
people are involved in free and open

00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,720
source software because they see it

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,250
resonate with their values all right

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,450
almost as many people even the guy who

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,980
didn't have his hand up the first sign

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:14,489
so that's good you're more kind of

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,650
activist and then there's the last quick

00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:18,630
questions how many a lot of people don't

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,400
identify this way how many people see

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:24,840
themselves as a part of a free software

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,030
open source movement the smaller group

00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,239
of people okay well you people let's

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:33,750
have a drinks afterwards so I'm going to

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,420
talk about sort of my values the idea of

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,609
values in something pragmatic like open

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,580
sores and how they can actually shape

00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:44,610
the world in deep and meaningful last

00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,250
in ways and i'm going to start 350 five

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,530
years ago does anybody have a guess

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:59,760
who's in this picture or what this is

00:03:49,530 --> 00:04:04,470
going on in here not at all Oh close he

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:07,320
said American science no not know it is

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,120
in fact Isaac Newton is in here and this

00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,770
is an early meeting of the Royal Society

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,410
of London which is you don't know

00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:16,230
preeminent scientific organization have

00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:18,450
many great famous scientists who have

00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:22,260
been fellows of the royal society and is

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:24,270
one of the institutions that really was

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,550
there at the founding of modern Western

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:29,010
science I mean these guys who set this

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:32,760
thing up you know at a time of alchemy a

00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:35,730
time of pervasive religion religious

00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,840
control over sore how society worked you

00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,320
know where there wasn't space for

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,690
science they were crazies you know they

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,060
were radicals they were they had a set

00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:47,370
of values and ideals that were different

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:51,210
than almost everybody in the society

00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:53,130
around them and they still exist today I

00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,320
was there talking to them about computer

00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:57,780
science curriculum at at the offices in

00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:01,800
London a couple of years ago and it

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:04,800
still says over the door in Latin take

00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,919
no one's word for it which was a radical

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,890
phrase at the time to say look for

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,200
evidence and what's interesting to me is

00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:14,730
not that I mean science has not done

00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,790
only good in the world it's also done

00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:19,890
bad i'm not saying the science is the

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,230
be-all and end-all but it is something

00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:25,680
that I believe is valuable but more

00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:29,370
important that institution those people

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,900
who are just people like us sow the

00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,720
seeds of something that really has

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:37,080
shaped humanity and that institution is

00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,729
still there 355 years later with people

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,460
who still share the values of those

00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:44,220
founders and still believe their purpose

00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,840
is to carry that movement forward and to

00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,080
have science continue to benefit

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,630
humanity and i think when i think about

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,910
free software that the ideas that i

00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:58,180
believe in in free software are as in

00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:01,180
as the ideas that gave us science the

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:03,460
idea that the information is something

00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,590
that can belong to all of us that we can

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,510
build on top of each other that is

00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,420
something that can have a multi-hundred

00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:12,820
year impact on who we become as humanity

00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:15,370
and actually also worried that those

00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,890
ideals don't shape where we go the other

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:20,080
direction is is not a good one so I

00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:24,250
start with this to say we vote were only

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,230
30 years in we've got another 325 go to

00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,660
you know get where we are today with

00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,130
science and I actually do believe we

00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,920
have the chance to do it they're also

00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:38,050
our number of things that are already

00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:40,330
getting in the way so let me take you 20

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,680
actually that's not 30 years ago it's

00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,270
good little bit well it's probably

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:49,420
actually about 30 years ago when was

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:53,250
that 1998 1988 anyways so that's me and

00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:55,000
that's my high school yearbook photo and

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,250
this is actually interesting because

00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,960
it's a it's a photocopy of a photocopy

00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,060
of protocol because it wouldn't let me

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,940
put that in the high school yearbook cuz

00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,530
I had a cigarette in my mouth and so I

00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:10,600
had a photocopy than I hand them out for

00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:11,890
people to paste them in all ways hacking

00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,190
publishing is one of the things I've

00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:17,830
done my whole life and anyways you know

00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,930
that at that time obviously I was a punk

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,650
rock kid I was involved in the peace

00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:25,240
movement as a peak peak of the Cold War

00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:28,000
and values have always been important to

00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,300
me in a particular something that I is

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,360
in kindred to free software is this DIY

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:37,510
ethic the idea that you know coming out

00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,980
of the 70s only big corporations really

00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,930
could make music that's what punk rock

00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,970
was standing up against and saying you

00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,280
can do it yourself you can get a four

00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,560
track tape recorder you can pick up a

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,060
guitar even if you can't play it you can

00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,830
do it you can make a magazine which is

00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,130
actually what I did is I was a zine guy

00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:56,020
not a musician and that ethic maybe

00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:58,600
feels especially for free software

00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,940
people pervasive today but that was

00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,070
actually a big deal in the 70s as punk

00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:06,600
rock comes out to say we can do it

00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:08,270
ourselves it's not culture creativity

00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,770
communication

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,680
are not only something that should be

00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:15,290
controlled we're very centralized

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,790
wealthy corporations and so I've always

00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,650
believed that and I think that's

00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:22,960
actually something that Richard Stallman

00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:26,600
believed as well oh wait what happened

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,920
30 years ago when he wrote this I I

00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,170
guess some people know what this is but

00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,270
this is the first two paragraphs of his

00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:34,040
announcement that he was going to create

00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:36,320
new and actually you should go read the

00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,330
whole thing it has lots of really

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,480
beautiful staff about how contribution

00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:43,790
works lots of very typical egotistical

00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,530
insecure Stallman stuff like all of the

00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:49,940
kind of settlements of the beauty and

00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:52,270
the horror um i was gonna make a very

00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:55,370
bad stolen truck I just held it in um

00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:59,270
but you know I think this really was the

00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:01,730
idea that he was going to do it himself

00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:04,070
and if you go and scroll down he was

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:06,500
inviting others to do it with him to

00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:09,770
create a completely free version of UNIX

00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:12,110
and you know love him or hate him and I

00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:15,140
think most people have mixed feelings he

00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,910
really seeded that idea and seated why I

00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,760
think even beyond the do-it-yourself

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:21,110
piece and it's related what I see as the

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,150
core of the movement that I see myself

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,240
belonging to and that I see Mozilla

00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:28,550
belong to that in a world where

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,250
computing is becoming pervasive I'm

00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:35,200
looking for my prop it's in my pocket

00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:38,660
you know in this world can we actually

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:42,140
have a situation where we fully control

00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:44,630
our devices our data and the things that

00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,680
actually shape our lives now in a world

00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,270
where we're going to have five billion

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,580
people on the internet within 10 years

00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:52,280
that actually matters that becomes an

00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:55,040
issue of where humanity goes do we

00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,940
control these or do we not and you'll

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,460
notice that this is a very

00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:01,720
uncontrollable device in my hand there's

00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:05,090
not a Firefox phone and in many ways

00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:08,000
while Stallman is inspiring what we are

00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:10,730
doing a lot of great work things are not

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,220
going as well as they need to for us to

00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,870
be really able to control these over the

00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,660
next three hundred and twenty-five years

00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,830
and so I'm going to talk a little bit

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,480
about where we've had some victories

00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,769
Mozilla in particular i'll give you a

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,689
little mozilla history

00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:27,339
where I think we've lost some ground

00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:29,749
with Mozilla and all of us and how we

00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:32,449
invest more deeply our energy in the

00:10:29,749 --> 00:10:34,069
right direction to build the next three

00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:37,879
hundred twenty-five years of freedom and

00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:39,860
so I think of and this of course for

00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:41,809
those who are historians will know as a

00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,220
point of controversy think of Mozilla

00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:45,439
very much as of the free software

00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,649
movement or at least you know very much

00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:50,899
born in its milieu and so this is in one

00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:53,809
of the great moments of it being born is

00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:56,689
Netscape decides to release the code as

00:10:53,809 --> 00:11:00,470
open source I guess in 98 it's got a

00:10:56,689 --> 00:11:01,970
date on there yes I'm correct and I can

00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,860
tell funny stories over drinks about how

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:08,410
to happen because I I know the people

00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:11,629
involved I was not anywhere around and

00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:13,189
you know it's a it's a thing that may be

00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:16,519
hard to imagine from this moment in time

00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:20,660
but here is a successful at the moment

00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:22,670
publicly traded company who is looking

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,160
into this chaotic free software movement

00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:27,079
which is still very much Stallman ask

00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,360
the words open-source are just really

00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:31,040
getting invented at a lot time those

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,740
little religious wars are starting and

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,319
this public company says we're getting

00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:38,480
hammered by Microsoft let's actually put

00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:40,429
the code out there as a competitive

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,129
strategy and let's go join with this

00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:45,139
crazy group of free software people that

00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:47,360
was what happened then was quite a

00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:50,240
radical move on the part of the people

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:55,939
inside of Netscape and what it unlocked

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:58,699
years later was the idea that became

00:11:55,939 --> 00:12:00,799
Firefox so this is Phoenix which i guess

00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:05,089
is 2003 does it have a copyright date on

00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:07,579
there I says 2002 which was the first

00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:09,860
fork of the Mozilla sweet that spun out

00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:11,689
a Netscape to just be a browser the

00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,869
intent behind it was to make a very fast

00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:17,059
browser you know without all of the

00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:19,189
email newsgroup HTML editor stuff

00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:22,629
there's something fast and good to take

00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:25,009
on internet explorer which eventually a

00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:28,639
year and a half later or so gets

00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:30,290
released as Firefox one point oh and you

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,480
know what's interesting is how many

00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,710
people have ever used firefox i know

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,080
many of you committed

00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:40,760
move to Chrome I don't so as you share

00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:44,150
our values I don't care and you know

00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:46,370
what comes of that is something that you

00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:50,630
can trace from you know Stallman

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:53,150
movement inspiring manifesto and release

00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:56,090
of new through to Netscape's action

00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:59,540
which is quite innovative in the part of

00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:01,790
a public company through a fork of the

00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,760
product which was actually contentious

00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:06,860
at the time to something then becomes a

00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,320
consumer product that all of us have

00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,390
used and really instantiate those values

00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,280
that movement for hundreds of millions

00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,840
of people even if they don't know it and

00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,510
so this is actually a little bit of the

00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,460
history of how it evolves that the it

00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:22,280
doesn't go up to date but you knows

00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:24,950
actually you can see in there more than

00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,960
five years where the people are

00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,280
struggling along to kind of innovate and

00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,530
like there's an open source community

00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,960
that people are using this Mozilla sweet

00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:36,970
but it has not taken off as a consumer

00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:40,130
product and you know really two things

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:43,340
happen in order for that take off to

00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:45,290
happen one is that kind of grinding down

00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,060
how many people actually to pick up

00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,740
another theme from Karen and Gideon's

00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,930
talk how many people have ever had a

00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:54,590
software project that his either failed

00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:56,090
or never had impact really use a lot of

00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:59,060
very successful people in here or people

00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:01,640
who have never written code so it's it's

00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:03,620
a common thing that you know any kind of

00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,530
project but software projects don't take

00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:08,420
off like that and it really was that

00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:11,360
persistence that mattered as well as an

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,920
insight let's just make the browser take

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,940
away the sweet do something consumers

00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:20,080
want as well as another factor is that

00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:23,960
once it got to that point people were so

00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:26,450
angry about Microsoft the product itself

00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:29,600
was so good that a movement actually

00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:32,000
formed around Firefox so maybe that's

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,400
the wrong point that a phrase that a

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,270
colleague of mine uses it's the product

00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:42,950
the movement needed and so what this is

00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:45,080
is actually the New York Times ad when

00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:47,059
Firefox one point 0 comes out which was

00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,429
not paid for by Mozilla Foundation

00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:52,249
but was 10,000 people all of whom

00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:56,359
donated to buy a quarter million dollar

00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:59,419
ad in The New York Times to say this is

00:14:56,359 --> 00:15:02,539
a new moment in time make a choice we

00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:05,029
have an independent browser and it was

00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:07,069
that sense of movement that sense that

00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:09,889
something bigger was going on than a

00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:13,639
product that made that spike happen just

00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:15,439
as much as the product itself and I kind

00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:18,949
of put those things together because to

00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:21,139
me that is the formula that we have used

00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:23,569
Mozilla but I think we have all used in

00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:25,999
bringing open source and free software

00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:28,579
much closer to the mainstream when you

00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:29,689
talk about a free software product you

00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:31,279
think it back back to nineteen

00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:33,769
eighty-three the imagine a free software

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,899
product is a consumer product for

00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:37,669
hundreds of millions of people and that

00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:39,949
many of them large large number of them

00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:41,179
feel an emotional affinity of it even if

00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:43,219
they don't really know what open source

00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:45,709
and free software is because they think

00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:48,069
it has some special values we know that

00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:51,169
to be true it's a huge achievement and

00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:53,209
to me that formula to get there is these

00:15:51,169 --> 00:15:54,379
three things the innovation the

00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:56,629
invention whether it's a business

00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:58,819
invention of releasing your code is open

00:15:56,629 --> 00:16:00,849
source as a public company or some of

00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:03,139
the technology innovations behind

00:16:00,849 --> 00:16:05,689
Firefox that push the web forward as

00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:07,879
well as something that people can grab

00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:11,449
and relate to and use everyday normal

00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:13,969
people not just programmers and then the

00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:16,039
idea of a movement that this is a social

00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:17,899
force that we are trying to change a

00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:19,759
shape where the world goes through what

00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:21,169
we do with this software or through we

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,479
do with anything frankly I think this is

00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:26,509
an important formula but this is what

00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:29,299
work for Mozilla work for all of us in

00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:34,009
bringing open and free somewhere closer

00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:37,869
to the mainstream so how has it been

00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:43,939
going since say 2007 on our last graph

00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:45,709
not as good as we would like which I'm

00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:47,089
not you know I'm not try to say I'm

00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:49,849
going to kind of look at how things are

00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:51,469
so is it this is a kind of ugly graph I

00:16:49,849 --> 00:16:53,119
looked at a bunch of ones to include

00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:55,279
last night but this is the best one

00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:57,529
because obviously you see Firefox

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,629
declining a little bit we haven't become

00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:00,060
irrelevant by any stretch where the

00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:03,390
orange

00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:05,160
line and surprisingly you see chrome

00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,900
which is a green line you know shooting

00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,420
app because Google made a great product

00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,250
but also because they've spent like

00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,540
billions I think actually literally

00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,870
billions that's certainly more than a

00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:18,030
billion in advertising and on Chrome and

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:21,360
are incredibly aggressive Microsoft

00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:23,910
becoming you know far less relevant than

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,160
it was not irrelevant Safari coming up

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:28,590
but what's also interesting is that

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,170
purple line which is mobile versus

00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,700
desktop browsing so the other thing that

00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:35,070
has happened at the same time as we

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,530
haven't kept pace against chrome has

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:40,800
been that their pressure is the other

00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:42,990
real pressure is mobile be starting to

00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,270
replace that stuff in percentage of time

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:47,970
that people spend on the internet and of

00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:49,890
course mobile is not primarily although

00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,900
this is changing a little bit oh

00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:55,110
actually sorry I want to say one thing

00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:58,410
before I say that the other stat to look

00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:01,380
at is if you actually look at operating

00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:04,920
systems where act we're in a world that

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:08,400
is becoming closer to windows with

00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:10,560
Android playing windows then many of us

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,110
actually think and I think it's

00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,630
dangerous so it's not true here where

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:18,870
Android is about 60-some percent of

00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:20,940
market share but in most of the emerging

00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:22,620
markets of the world that's the split

00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,930
between Android and everything else and

00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,750
Apple is not present in those markets

00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:29,910
for all intents and purposes and so

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:33,330
we're moving to mobile we're also moving

00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:35,820
back into a monopoly setting very much

00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:38,460
like the window setting as we grow to

00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:40,620
five billion people on the Internet so

00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,210
in terms of how it's going right now the

00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,560
dillas you know struggling with its

00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:45,930
relevance as our desktop browser

00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,370
declines people are moving to mobile

00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:50,750
which is a good thing I love being on

00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:55,050
mobile but back into a centralized

00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:57,060
monopoly economy and I guess you know

00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,910
that you might say well that's not so

00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:02,430
bad we're an open source conference you

00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:04,980
know isn't android open source it's the

00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,420
first android phone the g1 and i

00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,200
remember i got to play with one bite

00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:12,850
somebody was developing it

00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:14,919
at a Riley foo foo camp in probably 98

00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,909
or whenever it came out and it was so

00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:18,549
exciting there's going to be this

00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:20,320
open-source smartphone and like this is

00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:23,889
awesome and I remember like I ordered

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:28,450
one as early as possible and it has not

00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:30,820
of course worked out that way yes there

00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:32,919
is linux and there are a lot of open

00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,320
source components behind Android we use

00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:36,730
a lot of them to build Firefox OS but

00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,649
google has built a vertically integrated

00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:41,740
stack so when we think about that

00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:43,570
ninety-one percent market share in in

00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,510
India they built a vertically integrated

00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:49,360
sac which put them in a position of

00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:51,700
controlling our use of computing and how

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,159
the market works the way this far far

00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,799
far more pervasive than Microsoft ever

00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:59,830
was on the desktop because they don't

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,570
only control the operating system which

00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:03,880
you could take the core components of a

00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,899
news on your own and many in China do to

00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,570
great effect because they don't care

00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:10,090
about the legal constraints but if you

00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:12,730
want to include maps or anything of the

00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:14,590
Google Play services you are incredibly

00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:16,539
locked down on what you can do with the

00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:18,250
operating system and then if you're a

00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:21,730
consumer and you wanted to choose

00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:25,299
anything other than Google's payment

00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:27,190
systems Google's Maps Google's identity

00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:29,320
system which you have to have to

00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,429
functionally use the phone or if you're

00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,260
a developer you want to get something

00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:34,210
distributed and you don't want to

00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:37,269
distribute through the Play Store you're

00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:39,190
mostly at a lot you can do some of those

00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:42,519
things but the whole thing is a

00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:44,799
vertically integrated centralized system

00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:47,350
all the way up and down the stack with

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,740
only the most minimal substrate being

00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:53,799
open so we're now back in a spot from a

00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:58,830
time where we had started to make open

00:20:53,799 --> 00:21:01,000
mainstream we're at the consumer level

00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:03,429
we're really seeing a shift back into

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,620
monopolies we're seeing folks like

00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:08,230
Mozilla and even folks like Wikipedia

00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:10,600
who are the kind of stellar consumer

00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:14,440
open source examples really struggling

00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:17,529
and then at the same time as the world

00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,539
goes mobile even the Internet starts to

00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:20,769
disappear into the background which of

00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,309
course is the greatest open source

00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:24,940
invention

00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:27,909
them all this is a story from quartz

00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:30,820
magazine which is actually a fun online

00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:32,230
site where they discover it and we we

00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,149
actually discovered through some field

00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,769
research before them and some others did

00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:38,769
and then they went out did some polling

00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:44,049
to validate this the in emerging markets

00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:45,309
a lot of facebook users including early

00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:48,370
people who've got their first

00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:50,649
smartphones don't know that the internet

00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:52,330
even exists so they have a smartphone

00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:53,889
they have an internet-enabled device

00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:55,389
where you go and you interview them

00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:57,610
which we've done in a bunch of our field

00:21:55,389 --> 00:21:59,710
resource and we say do you use the

00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:03,669
internet on that device and they say

00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:04,840
well what's the internet and say well do

00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:06,340
you use that for anything other than

00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:10,090
phone calls Oh while I use it for

00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:12,820
facebook and there literally is no sense

00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,990
that anything exists beyond that so we

00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,999
you know they're using a lockdown

00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,619
smartphone that only has google on it

00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:19,600
and they don't know that there are any

00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:21,879
apps other than Facebook and of course

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,190
they may know many people know there's a

00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:26,590
few more but it's a very closed economy

00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:30,369
a much more closed economy for most

00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:32,110
people digitally than was the case ten

00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:34,240
years ago windows was a very open

00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:36,399
platform in many ways compared to this

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,240
there's anybody can install software

00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:42,730
just from a floppy disk or a CD and then

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,610
that the last oh I guess I have two last

00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:49,210
things that kind of this is my my moment

00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:50,860
of woe you know we've tried to fix this

00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:53,590
a little bit in the last three or four

00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:56,049
years if you've been watching so we came

00:22:53,590 --> 00:23:00,279
out the operating system Firefox OS for

00:22:56,049 --> 00:23:03,999
smartphones now on televisions and it

00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:05,830
has not succeeded so far and I would say

00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:07,990
if I'm being honest we're kind of going

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:10,360
back to the drawing board to say how do

00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:13,029
we succeed how do we enter into the

00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,860
mobile market it's not easy it's not

00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:17,470
easy at all and it's not for lack of

00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,909
trying it's not for lack of partners and

00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:21,159
telephone carriers all around the world

00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:22,659
we're not a tiny startup is just trying

00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:24,789
to enter that nobody's ever heard of

00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:26,950
it's not for lack of big announcements

00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:29,519
at Mobile World Congress we haven't been

00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:32,320
able to put a dent in this increasingly

00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:37,029
close stratified environment

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,590
mobile so it's not that optimistic but

00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:40,029
you know we're there we're the movement

00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,429
we believe in it we're going to keep

00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:47,159
going right but then you know things

00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:49,690
like this happen we're even our allies

00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:53,559
it's hard for us to keep those alliances

00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:56,409
and so this is a decision I certainly

00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:59,139
stand by that we put eme we put

00:23:56,409 --> 00:24:01,149
basically standards-based drm in Firefox

00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:02,740
we didn't have a choice because we'd be

00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:04,240
basically taking Firefox away from

00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,450
anybody who wanted to watch youtube or

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,980
netflix if we hadn't put it in it was

00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:11,169
the right decision because we were not

00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:13,870
going to convince the technology

00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:15,850
industry not to put drm in web standards

00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:18,039
but it means that our relationship to

00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,750
that movement become strained and I

00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,970
think we'd say in general both for

00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,620
reasonable reasons like this and also

00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:26,830
for silly reasons in terms of where we

00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:29,169
put our energy we have not stayed as

00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:32,259
tightly tied into the movement that I

00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:36,100
believe and we believe we're from as we

00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:40,600
were when we first took off in 2004 and

00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:43,809
2005 so you know if we're trying to get

00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,340
to 325 more years of freedom I think

00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:48,340
about Mozilla situation but also the

00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:50,950
situation in the world we have moved I

00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:53,919
think back to some degree from where we

00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:56,769
were 10 years ago or five years ago even

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,480
it's not that we aren't succeeding it's

00:24:56,769 --> 00:25:00,039
not that we are not all having impact as

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,559
certainly free software and open source

00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:05,500
runs huge parts of the internet you know

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:08,230
it runs most of the internet companies

00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,879
you you know so from an infrastructure

00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:12,269
perspective free software's being

00:25:09,879 --> 00:25:15,039
continues to be incredibly perspective

00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:17,590
successful from a shaping consumer

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,990
experience are we able to control this

00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:25,240
part of our lives things are not going

00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:27,279
as well as we need them to go so I you

00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,200
know I worry that we don't have enough

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:32,559
of these three things in this formula

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,620
and it makes me wonder you know how long

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,970
do we keep this run going and do we

00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:39,730
actually build these values into

00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:43,149
humanity and society in the way that

00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:45,159
science heads I still believe we can and

00:25:43,149 --> 00:25:45,940
must especially because the future we're

00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:49,149
going to get

00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:52,029
is a very close surveilled centralized

00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:53,320
one if we do not that's why I care but

00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:57,610
this is a movement as well as a

00:25:53,320 --> 00:26:05,110
pragmatic thing but we need to do

00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:07,990
something different so am i sad no I'm

00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:09,610
actually quite optimistic and I'm

00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:11,769
optimistic partly because I'm you know

00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:16,450
here in a room of people like this great

00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:18,100
thanks you know when you're when you

00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:20,320
face adversity when things aren't going

00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,940
totally your way but you know you got

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,309
the right team you've got people you

00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:26,500
care about you know you are working in

00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:28,720
the right direction you double down and

00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,190
try to figure out what to do and I think

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,129
that's what as a free software and open

00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:34,750
source movement we need to do certainly

00:26:33,129 --> 00:26:36,759
what Mozilla internally we are doing

00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:38,980
look at how we build on our strengths

00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:40,929
our success and where we want to go and

00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,360
i feel quite optimistic that we're

00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:45,789
starting to head in that direction as

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:50,049
Mozilla and just as a little bit of

00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:51,820
context on my role i came in in 2008

00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:53,710
this is a little bit after I had met day

00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,570
when I was at shallower foundation but

00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:57,909
mark shuttleworth the guy who made a bun

00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:59,980
to really with the goal of

00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:01,419
reinvigorating the foundation and

00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,340
bringing more participation round

00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:05,289
Mozilla and we've started to do that I

00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:07,720
think Mitchell you know one of our co

00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:09,580
founders knew we needed to do that in

00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:13,899
addition to succeed in the market at the

00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:15,580
time and since then separate from

00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:17,289
Mozilla although Mozilla playing side of

00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:20,200
it I do think there are a number of

00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:21,970
things that as the world or the Internet

00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,980
has faced more challenges and gotten

00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:27,159
worst I think a lot of other things have

00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:29,200
started to happen that gave me hope you

00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:33,279
know as as we kind of move forward and

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:35,169
so one was when how many people know

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,029
what SOPA PIPA was which is a sort of

00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:38,950
legal okay so a bunch of people Joe so

00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:41,500
I'd explain there was a thing called the

00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:44,049
Stop Online Privacy Act in the u.s. that

00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,450
almost passed I mean the 34 years ago it

00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:47,470
was going to break dns and break the

00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:49,929
internet bunch ways and which is

00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:54,340
generally a nasty law I almost passed

00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:56,830
and Wikipedia Mozilla a bunch of the

00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,330
main companies like Google all got

00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,350
involved including a bunch of us like

00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,090
Wikipedia Mozilla

00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:05,169
basically blocking out our sites in

00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:07,530
protest you had never seen ever in the

00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:11,010
history of the internet that level of

00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:13,390
consensus and energy on taking on

00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:15,910
political issues to defend our vision of

00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:17,650
the internet like you had seen then it

00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:20,980
just had not happened till them Silicon

00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:22,990
Valley the hacker community everyone was

00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:25,690
galvanized to say we have to have a

00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:27,820
political voice if we want to build the

00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:29,110
vision of the world that we have so one

00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:31,330
thing that has happened is the internet

00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:33,760
has started to find its political voice

00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:35,679
based on the kind of values I'm talking

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,169
about and that I think most of us or

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,120
many less in this room share and Mozilla

00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:43,720
has been a part of that along with

00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,520
others another thing that has started to

00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,169
happen even though it remains nascent I

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,409
think it's a lot more like the free

00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:52,299
software movement was in the 90s is you

00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:53,740
you start to see open hardware in the

00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:56,490
maker movement and of course Raspberry

00:28:53,740 --> 00:29:01,740
Pi is not fully open hardware Arduino is

00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:04,539
but the idea that literally we want

00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:08,020
devices that we can all control or that

00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:11,380
those who choose to control is become a

00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:13,419
much much bigger thing and it's not free

00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,980
software / say there's a lot of hybrid

00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:17,500
stuff there's all kinds of questions

00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:20,289
about as you collect data with this how

00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,940
do we think about data and privacy and

00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:23,950
private data and how do we think about

00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:26,169
open source in that environment but to

00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:27,820
me that's a positive trend when I go to

00:29:26,169 --> 00:29:29,770
the maker faire in New York as I did

00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:33,940
about whatever a month ago three weeks

00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:36,010
ago the number of interesting hackable

00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:39,190
board projects including a 30-dollar

00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:41,620
build your own phone project was like

00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:45,370
quadruple from what I had seen last year

00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:48,700
and so there is energy and momentum in

00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:51,610
things that share our values and that

00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:53,770
also gives me a lot of hope and a lot of

00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:56,049
energy and Mozilla is involved in a lot

00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:57,460
of those things and it's not just open

00:29:56,049 --> 00:29:59,710
hardware and it's not just the maker

00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:01,480
movement it's also people doing open

00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:03,640
data in science it's also people doing

00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,730
open education there's a lot of places

00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,770
where what Stallman thought about and

00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:11,950
what all of us are involved in is

00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:12,559
pervading in society in ways that if it

00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,570
continued

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:19,249
is do have that kind of shaping

00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:21,350
influence that science has had and just

00:30:19,249 --> 00:30:23,179
that a third thing that gives me a

00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:25,730
little bit hope of a sideways and hard

00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:30,379
to read that we made this poster the

00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:32,990
wrong shape for a slide is you know when

00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:34,669
we release Firefox 10 last fall and

00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:37,460
Chris beard who's my colleague who runs

00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:41,029
the the product side of the organization

00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:42,649
came back we really did say we have to

00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:44,899
go back out and take a stand take a

00:30:42,649 --> 00:30:47,509
stand that Firefox is about a set of

00:30:44,899 --> 00:30:49,879
values is about independence and we have

00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:51,799
to start building those ideas more

00:30:49,879 --> 00:30:53,509
aggressively back into the product and

00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:55,879
the product not just being the desktop

00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:59,450
browser but also being on Android and

00:30:55,879 --> 00:31:01,070
iOS now and also over time hopefully

00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:04,009
being an integrated set of cloud

00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:06,169
services so I'm actually quite hopeful

00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:09,230
despite where we are because we see a

00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:11,480
political voice coming around the

00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:14,539
internet which is the movement part we

00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:17,059
see innovation happening in all kinds of

00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:20,149
places open hardware open education open

00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:23,330
data and we ourselves and I think others

00:31:20,149 --> 00:31:25,429
are as well stepping back in how do we

00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:27,830
take those values those trends that

00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:29,210
innovation and build it into products

00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:30,919
again that hundreds of millions of

00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:32,809
people were eventually billions of

00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:37,999
people will use those are the things we

00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:40,909
all need to be thinking about so this is

00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:42,320
just my view anybody who has knows me

00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:43,940
and knows this is what everything looks

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,789
like in my blog just from a blog post

00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:49,100
this week what Mozilla needs to do and I

00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:51,619
think it is you know something that we

00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:53,509
all need to do in our own way is focus

00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:55,970
in the next era so the next five to ten

00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:59,119
years I'm making open mainstream again

00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:01,279
or making open more mainstream making it

00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:03,350
be something that not only people like

00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,720
people in this room feel and experience

00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:08,389
making it feel like my phone my

00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,759
thermometer my data I collected my

00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:12,830
science school project that I understand

00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:14,869
how the heck ability of those things the

00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:17,110
portability of those things my control

00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:20,720
of those things actually has utility

00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:23,090
value and meaning for me I think that's

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,519
what we all need to be focused on and I

00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:26,200
do think it is achievable I do think it

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,230
in

00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:32,650
aggregate can put chinks in the armor of

00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:34,810
the emerging monopolies and so

00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:38,650
concretely where we are investing energy

00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:41,260
is really to build out from firefox from

00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:43,660
the base we have leaning even further

00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:47,080
back into our values in what we will

00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:49,840
release over the next couple years to

00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,850
focus on innovation inside Mozilla where

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,430
we find the next beachhead we haven't

00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:57,970
done that yes with Firefox OS we may in

00:32:54,430 --> 00:33:00,100
the second try we may in IOT we may in

00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:01,450
privacy friendly advertising if you

00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,910
watch us you know we're playing an all

00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:06,460
of the things but we need to find

00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:07,990
another place beyond the browser to have

00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:11,020
relevance and bring our values to the

00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:12,880
mass market and I do believe we need a

00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:15,520
lot of people trying to do that not just

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,860
Mozilla and then the last thing is we

00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,960
need to fuel and be a part of the

00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:22,120
movement that we were born of and

00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,890
continue to want to be a contributor to

00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,200
better than we have in the last five

00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:28,210
years and that's a lot of where my work

00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,920
day to day with the foundation sit is

00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:32,140
supporting others who are working in

00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:34,300
this space so that's your first glimpse

00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:36,610
at what I hope will be or is emerging as

00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:39,850
the Mozilla strategy or where we are

00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:44,290
headed as a group although we don't use

00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:46,180
those words my take on it and just to

00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:47,380
give you a kind of tiny wrap-up and

00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,900
evidence that some of this stuff is

00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:50,980
happening you start to see this is our

00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,220
chief counsel and head of business

00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:57,100
development talking about things like

00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:59,110
content blocking as we think about

00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:01,390
product directions in the market and so

00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:03,700
we're really trying to move quickly and

00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:06,730
lean into those topics as they emerge

00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:09,460
this is from a few weeks ago we've just

00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:12,190
hired a new chief innovation officer who

00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:15,310
somebody I love she's a CEO of a big

00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:17,500
German newspaper Henry birch are and are

00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:20,440
looking at how we reinvest in innovation

00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:23,350
and incredibly focused and aggressive

00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,270
way and she'll join us in January this

00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:27,670
is the post from Chris my colleague of

00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:29,410
runs the Firefox group and I am very

00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:32,200
proud to say and this is a dip in the

00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:34,750
bucket for what we should do and will do

00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,460
starting next year we just launched a

00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:39,340
grant program to support open source

00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:40,120
projects that Mozilla relies on so if we

00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:43,390
draw on your

00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:45,550
code we will be giving out a set of

00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:48,100
grants from a million-dollar pool to

00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:49,840
support those projects another say I

00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,460
think we want to do more of that so that

00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,320
is that's reham bracing the movement

00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,510
that is us getting into innovation and

00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,970
us thinking differently again about the

00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:00,340
product so I'm hopeful in that I'm

00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:01,990
hopeful that in that we can get back on

00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,850
this track and I'm hopeful in the next

00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:05,290
ten years all of us can be focused on

00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:08,640
this track so the work we're doing

00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:11,440
actually has impact and shapes the world

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:14,590
and I guess I want to finish with one

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:18,850
last thought and then I can open up to

00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:23,110
any questions for me the most important

00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:26,080
part of getting there is people like the

00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:28,540
people in this room that leadership that

00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:31,240
axial leadership we all take whether

00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:33,880
they are just choosing to use open

00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:38,080
source in your own projects whether

00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,820
that's giving code back into a project

00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,170
that you borrowed from whether that's

00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:43,000
building something yourself and

00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:44,620
releasing it open source whether it's

00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,340
teaching other people as many of the

00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:50,830
folks at Seneca do here whether it's you

00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:53,530
know leading the political part of this

00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:56,230
movement all of those leadership sin

00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:58,210
aggregate are needed for us to move the

00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:01,330
ball along the field and build the world

00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:03,340
that most of us many of us want inserted

00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:06,370
I want to see which is a better world

00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:09,330
that embeds those ideas of freedom and

00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:12,250
so one person I just want to call out

00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:14,140
here in this picture is my good friend

00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:16,330
day of Humphrey who introduced me he's

00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:19,150
hiding as he often is back in the corner

00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:20,920
where you can't see him and this is Dave

00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,750
receiving an award that was well well

00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,870
deserved from the Governor General for

00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:27,310
the work here at Seneca and I think you

00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:29,020
know it's such a great example

00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,880
especially you know listening to Gideon

00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,880
and Kieran's presentation a few minutes

00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:36,340
ago of what we need to do which is not

00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:39,280
only ourselves take leadership but also

00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:41,080
build other leaders and so we'll be

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,520
announcing over the next couple of

00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,800
months a creation of something will call

00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:47,350
the Mozilla Leadership Network which is

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,630
really to encourage and recognize people

00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:52,030
like Dave people like we work with

00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:52,930
around the world who are trying to bring

00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,970
others into

00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:57,970
this movement help them be effective and

00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:59,890
help us actually build our ideas into

00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:06,309
how the world works so probably a thank

00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:09,250
you today and I do believe that if we do

00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:12,700
that this is Dave now as Isaac Newton so

00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:14,920
kind of but i do believe actually in

00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:17,950
aggregate these acts add up to this

00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:20,140
right these were normal people these

00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:22,420
were normal people who took acts of

00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:24,369
leadership who had a belief that

00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:26,950
something that was very uncommon in the

00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:30,819
world around them is something that was

00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:33,430
needed and I believe that our values of

00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:35,950
freedom the pragmatism of it the poetry

00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:38,349
of it the vision of it is important to

00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:40,660
humanity and at the internet we get into

00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:43,930
society we get if we don't succeed with

00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,910
those values is not a pretty one so I

00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:49,750
believe we can build an amazing future

00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:51,910
as we lead and lean into the values we

00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:54,880
have the software we build and the

00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:58,750
people around us and that is a way we

00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,900
get 350 years of software freedom thank

00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,900
you

00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,330
so I'm how do you take questions I got

00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:15,060
close to my 30 minutes yes big handbag

00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:17,730
shatter that why do you not use the

00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:22,680
Firefox bowl why I have people not

00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:24,150
bought Firefox Phillips it's just it why

00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,070
have people not bought Firefox phones

00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:29,910
they're not something that is there not

00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:31,710
a great product to me my biggest reason

00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:34,050
was that they feed on such low and

00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:37,260
hardware and hard to acquire in Canada

00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:40,650
yeah even if you I have three you

00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:43,770
wouldn't be using I mean basilic always

00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:50,490
in the back you may be upset that I say

00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:52,710
that do you but and so that you know the

00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:54,540
thing is getting into the consumer

00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:57,390
market is hard i would say a mistake we

00:38:54,540 --> 00:39:00,060
made was twofold you said one of them

00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:01,710
which was really thinking that we could

00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:03,810
go to the bottom of the market i have my

00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,190
entry strategy that just didn't work out

00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:07,080
right so people make wrong business

00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:08,430
that's all the time the people who are

00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,200
leading that part of the strategy aren't

00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:12,090
with us anymore that wasn't the right

00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,100
way to enter the market it seemed like a

00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:17,400
reasonably reasonable theory at the time

00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:20,820
and I become there's there's three

00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,740
things actually the other is you know we

00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,720
really focus on the engineering side and

00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:27,120
not the consumer product market fit side

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,530
so that's where we're going back and I

00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,600
think the third thing is we actually

00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:34,800
didn't look at our core base and so by

00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:36,090
going to the $25 smartphone we didn't

00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,650
look at whether somebody like you or to

00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:40,050
me or something they might want to use

00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,910
in terms of hiring hardware we pay 600

00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:43,560
bucks for an open-source phone if it was

00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:45,720
good and then that's how you roll it out

00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,370
from there we are going back to that so

00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:51,450
some of the current things that we're

00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:53,190
doing now are there is a set of projects

00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:55,440
including one of the basic you can flash

00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:58,260
an android phone with lots of different

00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,910
sets of hardware with firefox OS so that

00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:02,790
is something we are leaning back into is

00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:05,310
start with our base of developers of

00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:06,720
people who care and grow and make it

00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,620
better from there as opposed to start

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,360
with people you can

00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:11,310
the phone which was the previous

00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,780
strategy so we're still figuring out how

00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:14,850
to do that but they're not great right

00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,130
now like that's the fact of the matter

00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:19,650
right I I would dare anyone in this room

00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:21,180
I know all of the most die-hard free

00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:23,850
software people who have tried including

00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:27,570
me to spend months with them and it's

00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:31,260
not something you want you but it seems

00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:33,720
to me said that every closed environment

00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:37,410
is now built on open source so just

00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:41,850
having I mean look at underneath iOS is

00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:45,600
PST absolutely underneath Android yeah

00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:47,640
so it seems like just not having a

00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:49,890
percentage of it percent of the code

00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:57,030
base is not how you win it seems like

00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:58,890
you have to only press and also we

00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:01,410
fighting battles you lost doesn't always

00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:04,080
work it seems like picking new areas

00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:07,110
that haven't been before it

00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:08,940
that's not my nature I I go back and

00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:13,020
refine things and make them better but

00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:15,090
it just looks like they'll open ground

00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:16,770
right now might the internet of things

00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:19,320
and people are desperately trying to

00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:22,980
close it if we can only keep it open

00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:26,910
it's a win servers we want on or close

00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:28,740
enough to winning but nothing else yeah

00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:31,290
so I was like well we won some ground

00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:37,920
and desktop browsers and it's like the

00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:39,390
videos we've done so so let me just

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,370
respond to that so I don't know people

00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:42,810
heard all that just surprises you know

00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:44,910
where do we pick our battles next week

00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:46,710
here with one underneath the hood on a

00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:48,960
bunch of back-end code and on servers

00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:51,990
and so I would agree with everything you

00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:55,260
said and I guess the one place I would

00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:57,660
would like tweak the words is I don't

00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:59,340
think that the rest is the crust I think

00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,930
there's a mind shift for those of us

00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:03,360
who've been open source for a long time

00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:05,100
which I have been to think about how do

00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:08,450
we apply our values in other components

00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:11,550
of it because payment is not the crust

00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:14,370
user interface frankly is not the crust

00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:15,540
the Internet of Things in fact it's the

00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:17,970
last thing of the crust is going to

00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:21,180
disappear behind our eyes and we're not

00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:21,540
even going to see it and so I think we

00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,220
actually

00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:25,530
have to look at where the power and the

00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:28,620
control points are which used to be much

00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:30,210
more at the operating system layer but

00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:31,410
the power and the control points are in

00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:33,270
a bunch of different places now and

00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:34,860
that's where even if people have free

00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:36,840
software under the hood they've

00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:39,300
consolidated a different control point

00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:41,550
so Google and Apple have consolidated in

00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:44,250
software distribution and payments with

00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:47,130
their stores you can't install stuff I

00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:49,560
mean it was so well certainly if you

00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:51,870
still use Linux but even on Windows it

00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,910
was so normal to you just get a disc

00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:56,010
from anybody and put a piece of software

00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:57,240
and you can't do that here anymore the

00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:58,800
control point has moved to the

00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,810
distribution mechanism and the payments

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,190
or it's moved to the maps the reason

00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:04,740
open street maps isn't working is

00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:06,990
because of licensing and integration

00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:09,240
into the operating systems which is

00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:11,100
where most of the consumer value comes

00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,080
from as well as all kinds of stuff

00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:15,210
around how surveillance and data works

00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:17,370
which provides us value and also takes

00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:20,190
away our privacy so it's that tangled

00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:22,230
web of things we have to go and I think

00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:23,880
focus on say where are the control

00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:26,460
points and where do we take our values

00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:29,010
where control points either are or to

00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:31,200
your point are likely to emerge and you

00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:32,700
would not be some prop don't be

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,140
surprised if you see us do more in the

00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,600
Internet of Things that the guy who's

00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:39,450
come in I'm very very excited about him

00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:41,880
actually re can never pronounce his last

00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:43,350
name which is Scandinavian he's just

00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,000
joining us next month to run what was

00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:46,770
the Firefox OS group and is now called

00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,540
the connected devices group I'm going to

00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:50,250
take a much more broad view of where we

00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:52,500
get involved and part of that's looking

00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:54,150
is where the market opportunity and then

00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,800
also where are the potential future

00:43:54,150 --> 00:44:00,300
control points that you can disrupt or

00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:04,230
avoid doesn't allow you to site little

00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:07,739
absent and so sure that the App Store

00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:10,719
and then you can take

00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:13,569
like neon red and white is across

00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:16,599
assistant yeah so it allows you to I

00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:18,609
mean how many puts a bad crowd ask kind

00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:22,779
of people's sideload apps on Android on

00:44:18,609 --> 00:44:24,339
a regular basis so if you actually want

00:44:22,779 --> 00:44:26,679
to have impact you have to engage with

00:44:24,339 --> 00:44:28,630
real consumer behavior if they have not

00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:30,699
made it convenient so that is I mean

00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:32,229
people in Google are big champions of

00:44:30,699 --> 00:44:33,669
open so are lots of people at Facebook

00:44:32,229 --> 00:44:36,309
not saying they're bad people they're

00:44:33,669 --> 00:44:38,890
not open components of it but it goes to

00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:40,779
what I just said before the real control

00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:43,119
points that actually make it clothes or

00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:44,709
not in our normal definition of getting

00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,869
software running on a piece of hardware

00:44:44,709 --> 00:44:48,999
the real control points are real

00:44:46,869 --> 00:44:50,380
distribution with convenience has to

00:44:48,999 --> 00:44:52,599
happen through the Play Store so unless

00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:54,640
your in china where their alternative

00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:56,099
android operating systems or you want to

00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,799
use android of the on their closed

00:44:56,099 --> 00:45:02,309
ecosystem there are no simple consumer

00:44:59,799 --> 00:45:04,719
distribution mechanisms where there's

00:45:02,309 --> 00:45:07,029
where there's options so it is a closed

00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:09,759
monopoly on software distribution for

00:45:07,029 --> 00:45:11,229
most people we can change that we could

00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:14,459
go train people to side love it but it's

00:45:11,229 --> 00:45:17,619
not happening in the market and then

00:45:14,459 --> 00:45:19,839
similarly with things like maps all of

00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:21,369
the real value I use it all the time I

00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,289
don't want to get off google map because

00:45:21,369 --> 00:45:26,139
all of the real value has to do with

00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:28,089
being tied into all the other gluten

00:45:26,139 --> 00:45:29,799
google play services and all of the data

00:45:28,089 --> 00:45:32,589
has been collected around my identity

00:45:29,799 --> 00:45:34,209
that's a bad I value from it but do we

00:45:32,589 --> 00:45:36,069
have alternatives to that that are more

00:45:34,209 --> 00:45:38,589
open and put us more control I don't

00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:40,449
know maybe not but it is at this point a

00:45:38,589 --> 00:45:44,130
closed system and a monopoly and that's

00:45:40,449 --> 00:45:47,289
more than chase that people make

00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:49,990
well that's that's the same as as saying

00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:52,029
you know there was a Mozilla sweet and

00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:54,039
an alternative operating Stern ative

00:45:52,029 --> 00:45:56,349
browser to the Internet Explorer since

00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:58,809
1998 people didn't use it it didn't have

00:45:56,349 --> 00:46:00,549
any impact on the world so in the

00:45:58,809 --> 00:46:03,400
mozilla position certainly my position

00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:06,249
is what you know why I talk about

00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:08,079
innovation product and movement is the

00:46:06,249 --> 00:46:11,079
innovation on its own and the ability

00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:13,150
for some set of very technically and

00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:14,470
motivated people to do something isn't

00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:16,960
enough to having back in the world you

00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:19,839
need also mass-market product based on

00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,609
the same on the same set of values and

00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,470
the manager of mass market products

00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:25,539
having impact is our large and

00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:29,619
reasonably using them and large rooms

00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:34,180
you are not side loading on Android why

00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:37,150
should why or how and why with the

00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:39,759
mass-market ever care about being able

00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:42,309
to open up their phone then for whatever

00:46:39,759 --> 00:46:45,069
device people don't want another car a

00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:47,559
little one like mass-market things are

00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:51,999
not open sourcing their merchandise

00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:53,829
commercial things so you know is it you

00:46:51,999 --> 00:46:56,140
know tilting against windows even

00:46:53,829 --> 00:46:58,210
thinking we can enter into the mass

00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:00,430
market universe with open source

00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:03,400
philosophies well we don't have these

00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:05,950
twice with firefox of Wikipedia so those

00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,660
are very mainstream things that people

00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:11,440
use every day they're open and that our

00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:13,690
under threat so like I I believe you can

00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:18,279
play in the market with a different set

00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:20,769
of values using those well they're not

00:47:18,279 --> 00:47:22,210
so that there's a different debate about

00:47:20,769 --> 00:47:24,339
whether you can make up the things that

00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:26,440
have a super relevant but what we do

00:47:24,339 --> 00:47:29,650
know from brand research from both of us

00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:32,259
at Wikipedia is that people do perceive

00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:34,150
that is different than corporate and

00:47:32,259 --> 00:47:35,829
that there is some internet e-values

00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:38,410
thing there so the thing of

00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:40,499
manufacturing or understanding people

00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:43,269
what people start to internalize them

00:47:40,499 --> 00:47:45,339
what is good about the kind of internet

00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:48,999
that we want versus the kind of internet

00:47:45,339 --> 00:47:50,440
we don't is like a whole curve public

00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:52,869
education challenges the reason I work

00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:55,779
so much on the public education side so

00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:57,309
people about that in large tens of

00:47:55,779 --> 00:47:58,660
millions or small hundreds of millions

00:47:57,309 --> 00:48:02,140
like there's something different there I

00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:03,789
want it can they describe open not

00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:07,839
probably not most of them so large

00:48:03,789 --> 00:48:09,519
numbers of them so I guess that's a not

00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:11,259
a thing of Canada consumer product video

00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:12,789
bandits what does it mean people how to

00:48:11,259 --> 00:48:15,999
make those choices and it's probably

00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:18,130
closer to organic food in terms of that

00:48:15,999 --> 00:48:19,720
challenge of how do you get people to

00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:21,700
make different choices that then

00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,710
influence market behavior that then

00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:27,789
influence at the substrate of how the

00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:30,910
actual power works you already went yeah

00:48:27,789 --> 00:48:34,809
some of them okay so go back to the

00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:37,019
Firefox poems or Firefox OS so all she

00:48:34,809 --> 00:48:41,289
did the 2500 sparkled they were

00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:43,180
Indonesia didn't really have it didn't

00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:45,489
work in Lockridge out a little bit talk

00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:48,099
about going for the more video segments

00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:50,470
may teach myself supermoto phones here

00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:52,220
or Europe this reminds me of the good to

00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:54,859
edge which also

00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:56,780
it's right crackling it how they even

00:48:54,859 --> 00:48:59,180
same thing would be touched Ross to

00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:00,770
regular place that's not been working

00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:05,930
out that so what are your thoughts on

00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:08,480
how Firefox like that same way so so

00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:10,580
today to two things one is this would be

00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,900
more specific about what I said really

00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:14,300
it's an experimental thing we're doing

00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:16,700
right now not a big business strategy to

00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:18,050
make it easy for developers to help us

00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,540
improve and play with the system by

00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:22,730
getting it on higher-end hardware so

00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:25,670
it's not a six-hundred-dollar consumer

00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:27,380
invite devices at this point the ability

00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:29,290
for you to flash a device at six hundred

00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:32,420
dollars and have a good experience

00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:34,700
really as a developer engagement piece

00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:36,710
but that's our base of supporters so

00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:38,300
partly but getting into the hands of our

00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:39,849
base of supporters seeing where they

00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:42,140
want to go as I open innovation

00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:43,940
experiment it's not a market play at

00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:46,190
this stage I don't stay on the market

00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:48,920
play like if we're just on it we don't

00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:51,680
know that like we didn't succeed in the

00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:54,080
first kick of the can happens a lots of

00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:56,030
people we're being honest enough to say

00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:58,339
we need to come back and we strategize

00:49:56,030 --> 00:50:00,560
is why re is joining us it's why we have

00:49:58,339 --> 00:50:02,450
a chief innovation officer we have to

00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:05,330
figure out where to this gentleman point

00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:08,510
where are the places in the market where

00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:10,369
are we we are a very literal double

00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:12,619
bottom line company on the corporate

00:50:10,369 --> 00:50:13,700
side which is to say where can we

00:50:12,619 --> 00:50:16,190
deliver something that large numbers

00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:18,710
people want that will be a vector for

00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:21,140
the delivery of our values and will not

00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:22,910
build something that can't succeed on

00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:25,130
both of those things and we don't know

00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:28,390
what that is right now we're working on

00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:28,390
it so if you have idea

00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:37,360
maybe one more question staring at the

00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:43,610
back end very high just an observation

00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:47,480
mozilla really big point like finance is

00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:50,710
really what drives the point I feel like

00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,710
it still doesn't get the respect

00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:57,529
that is true

00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,799
because

00:50:57,529 --> 00:51:00,799
renton wait

00:51:03,579 --> 00:51:08,599
so

00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:14,140
people use it morning

00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:17,579
Mozilla Firefox should have integration

00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:17,579
and directly

00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:24,860
yeah so I would agree I could have put a

00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:26,990
Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies up instead

00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:28,970
of a hardware as a thing that gives me

00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:32,020
optimism so and I do think you're right

00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:34,460
doesn't get the respect that it deserves

00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:36,170
it was also all kinds of complicated

00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:38,450
questions around cryptocurrencies but

00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:41,360
for sure there's a lot of potential

00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:43,190
space and a vector there we do take

00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:47,210
donations my bitcoin if you want to

00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:51,020
trans identity Mozilla buy Bitcoin but I

00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:52,760
i would agree and then just to just

00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:55,070
finish that it speaks to the point that

00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:57,350
what we have to be looking at is where

00:51:55,070 --> 00:52:00,920
do our values interact with the places

00:51:57,350 --> 00:52:02,780
where control exists in the digital

00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,910
world because the digital world will be

00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:06,770
the world for us already usable all of

00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:08,960
us live in it will be the world in which

00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:11,240
all of humanity lives in in a very short

00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:13,640
amount of time so we're if we're

00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:16,340
concerned about power not everybody is I

00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:18,800
am how empowered works in the digital

00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:21,260
world including money is an important

00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:24,170
issue and the way that we all do can

00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:26,300
shape where they go so that thanks for

00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:28,690
inviting me Chris and thanks everybody

00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,690
