- oh thank you very much so I do a lot

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,190
of work with open source projects like

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,350
Firefox for example looking for ways

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,180
that we can make contribution easier for

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,149
people who would like to contribute to

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,460
said project so let's say you're in the

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,750
position of you are a maintainer for

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,000
project you've just released it to the

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,920
world you have heard about those many

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,540
eyeballs that will make your bug shallow

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,520
and you want to take advantage of them

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,630
what do you do let's see we need to

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,310
think about this in two different ways

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,320
we're gonna think about it from the

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,670
terms of as a maintainer what are your

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,740
responsibilities is what do you need to

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,600
provide we're gonna think about as a

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,070
contributor or someone who would like to

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,229
contribute what are the things that you

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,119
are looking for and together this will

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:34,110
give us a view for what we need to do

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,790
for our project so as a maintainer you

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,049
first need to think about like who are

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,490
you actually targeting if you are

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,950
thinking about people contributing to

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,470
your project who are these people are

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,630
they are they users of a library or an

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,159
application you're writing are they just

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,670
developers we're trying to gain a new

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:54,210
skill these are things need to consider

00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,770
then you need to think about what is the

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,820
full range of possibilities that someone

00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,110
what are the way if someone could

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,860
contribute what are the things they

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,990
could work on but also are those things

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,360
that you would like them to work on are

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,280
there things that you would not actually

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,080
like to take contributions forward

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,510
that's totally acceptable some areas

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,620
require certain domain experience and

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,720
it's okay to say

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,099
you know you're welcome to contribute to

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,620
any of these other areas instead and

00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:22,739
finally as a maintainer you need to be

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,970
able to to draw a boundary and say you

00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:26,840
know I'm willing to provide this much

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:29,970
help for someone to allow them to

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,650
contribute to this project but you know

00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,180
you don't have to do that you don't have

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,010
to devote all your time to this if

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,569
someone does not be a certain minimum

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,409
skillset that is an okay choice to make

00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:42,629
but it should be a choice now as a

00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:45,629
contributor there are certain

00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:47,940
requirements in order to get involved in

00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:50,220
a new in a new project as a contributor

00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,019
you might come to a project and you

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,519
might want to know like what are the

00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,170
skills that I require in order to

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,680
contribute to this what are the

00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,790
expectations placed upon me and my work

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,530
what are the things that I can work on

00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,659
what are the things that I possess the

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,390
skills to work on what are the things

00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:08,040
that are allowed for me to work on are

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,209
there things that have deadlines are

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,310
there things that are already assigned

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,920
to other people if these things aren't

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,750
clear then has a new contributor it's

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,359
it's a it's difficult to see where you

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,730
fit in and finally what's involved in

00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:23,069
actually sharing my work if I do

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,480
successfully make a change then what are

00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,310
the steps I need to go through in order

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,730
to get that out in the wider world and

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:32,760
also was very very important is when you

00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:35,790
get stuck how do you get help what are

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,160
the specific places you go to what do

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,690
the the mechanisms use is it a live chat

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,579
system is there a forum is there a

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,169
mailing list is there a certain email of

00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:47,160
someone who says yes I want to help you

00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:49,109
as a contributor like you you need to

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,620
know where to actually go to get help

00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:55,650
for these things so our goal as a

00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,810
project maintainer is to take all these

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:01,470
things all these ideas and combine them

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:04,169
so basically together we are going to

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,549
figure out how to help our target

00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:08,780
audience we've decided we are targeting

00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:11,579
we're gonna help them find the project

00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,680
we're going to help them actually start

00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:15,780
getting involved and contributing and do

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,010
that quickly and then we're going to try

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,349
to help them have a positive experience

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:21,329
and we'll see how all of those things

00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:22,830
together will then establish a sort of

00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:26,520
feedback loop that will help us gain

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:28,919
more contributors over time so

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,229
I've got a straightforward five-point

00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:32,960
plan in order to address the V the

00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,639
second two of those points actually

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,110
there's three of these and the second

00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,639
two are actually the most important here

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,169
because it turns out if you are

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,000
marketing a project far and wide but you

00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:44,250
don't actually have systems set up to

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,930
ensure the experience is positive for

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,039
new contributors you're going to have a

00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,460
bunch of people bouncing and that's no

00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:50,870
good

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,650
so let's focus on the second to first so

00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,259
we're gonna go through all these steps

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:59,610
and we're gonna start with prioritizing

00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:00,569
important information this is key and if

00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,039
you thought you're gonna walk out of

00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:04,110
here without making any changes to your

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:09,319
documentation you were wrong let me tell

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:12,659
you documentation is so important so

00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:14,580
absolute fundamentals someone who comes

00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:16,020
your project needs to know how am I

00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,270
going to use this thing is an

00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,919
application can I install by an area or

00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,389
do I need to build from source how do I

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,889
build it from source what are the steps

00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:24,840
involved what skills do I need what

00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:27,060
technology all of these things need to

00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,280
be documented you're also going to have

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,229
to tell them like how do you make

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,780
changes as we talked about there are

00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:35,460
often steps you need to go through but

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,780
if these are hidden and not documented

00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,150
it's going to be much harder for someone

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,590
they're going to be arbitrarily setting

00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,030
the bar at a certain level and saying

00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,490
well if you can't figure it out by

00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:46,830
yourself tough luck we don't want you

00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,419
and if you're really keen on actually

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,430
getting contributions from a larger pool

00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:51,960
of people then they're going to have to

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,500
go to more work in order to make that

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,599
possible and again where can you get

00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,069
support this is where you documented

00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:01,469
this is where you bless certain

00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:02,909
communication mechanisms if there's a I

00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:05,310
or C channel for your project for

00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:08,190
example then yes you can list that but

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,729
keep in mind that for things like time

00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,250
zones

00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:13,590
sometimes if all of your teammates are

00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,849
all in the same time zone anyone on the

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,860
opposite side of the world is going to

00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:19,830
have problems so you should probably

00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:22,020
think about like what makes sense for

00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,780
support should we have an email list as

00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,639
well as an IRC channel that's good as

00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,130
long as people are actually checking the

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,800
email list because that's really really

00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,449
bad if you say yes we'll support you and

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,070
people just keep sending messages to

00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:38,159
something that never gets a response

00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:40,080
that's really disheartening so put it in

00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:41,430
the readme the readme is a

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,129
back to standard by this point it's been

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,919
around since the 80s earlier probably

00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:48,330
when people started using those and it's

00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,159
just going to be the things that are

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:53,789
most important for people to know off

00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:55,979
the top so as an example I work on a

00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:58,349
project called servo which is on github

00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:00,120
and this is this is a little screenshot

00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:01,830
of part of our readme and so it's got

00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,680
some of the most important bits it's got

00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,930
a description of what servo is it's got

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,150
links for where to go if you need to

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,849
learn how to contribute to it and then

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,650
it's got you know things about we

00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,849
currently develop it on these platforms

00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,710
therefore these the platforms you'll

00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:17,729
need if you're going to work on it and

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,469
then we have instructions for each

00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,969
platform for how to set it up for that

00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:22,530
platform so it's all fairly

00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:24,270
straightforward stuff but this is what

00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:28,199
we decided is most important for our

00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:32,250
audience now next step the more advanced

00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:34,379
stuff roadmaps are really useful I said

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,669
earlier you can decide like what you

00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:36,990
want people to work on what you don't

00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:38,150
want people to work on where you draw

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,469
the line for accepting contributions

00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:42,240
roadmaps are a really good way of

00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:44,310
establishing that that's where you can

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,500
lay out the plan for the project it can

00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,419
be at a very early stage if you say this

00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,430
is our goal we want to get it to this

00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:51,659
point we expect to go through sort of

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,479
these stages for that we're gonna work

00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:56,099
on these these features these components

00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:58,469
you can also specify that certain things

00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:00,690
are an on goal we don't want to turn

00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:02,789
this library that you know currently

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,770
does you know high performance numeric

00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:07,319
calculations into an email library

00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,490
that's you know kind of different

00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,039
ballpark there we're not going to do

00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,569
that and so yeah this is a way of

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,759
setting expectations for people and

00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:16,440
additionally it allows potential

00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,610
contributors to look at your list of

00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,460
what you're going to be working on and

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,830
give them ideas things like oh I see

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,870
you're going to be adding you know

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,669
visualization to your high performance

00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,050
numeric computation library that's

00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:31,860
something I've experienced in I bet I

00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:37,019
could work on that the other really

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:38,370
important thing here is github has has

00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,979
its own de facto standard that it's

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:43,050
created for files called contributing MD

00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:46,170
which stands for markdown which is just

00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:48,029
a way of formatting documents and what

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,980
this means is if you put anything

00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:52,260
content in that file then anytime

00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,610
someone opens up a pull request for your

00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,860
repository or files

00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,750
- there'll be a little link right above

00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,980
there it says please review the

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,420
guidelines for contributing to this

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,540
repository and that'll take any

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,490
contributor directly to that file and so

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,709
that's really great you can use that to

00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,510
specify a recommended workflow for

00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:12,209
contributing to your project you can

00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,279
also list things like what it was the

00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:16,350
style guide what what things do we

00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:18,360
require from all of our contributions

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,029
before we actually will allow them to

00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,870
merge into the main master repository

00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:26,100
this is great this is again setting

00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,930
expectations documenting requirements

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,079
these are the things that people look

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:34,260
for when they are coming to potentially

00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:36,720
contribute to a new project so here's a

00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,660
screenshot of part of the contributing

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,730
got MD for servo as you can see we start

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,640
off with you know welcome inviting

00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,870
contributions and then we also lay out

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,130
what our requirements are for

00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,600
contributions they're gonna be pull

00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,829
requests and they're going to be

00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,860
reviewed there's going to be a code

00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:54,390
review that happens we link to ways to

00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,149
find things to work on we link to

00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,740
another guide for specific coding

00:09:57,149 --> 00:10:01,410
related strategies for getting involved

00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,940
then we have a list under that of things

00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,449
you should watch out for if you're

00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,850
making a pull request

00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:12,000
now expert mode here's where it gets

00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,320
interesting as a project you can just

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,230
coast along on the things we've talked

00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,600
about so far but there are certain

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:20,699
tricks that projects have discovered

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,459
over time that help gain the attention

00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:25,829
of people for example every time you do

00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:28,199
a big release of some kind if you have

00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:30,480
release notes that document what changed

00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:32,850
why it's interesting who contributed

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,100
these are great these these allowed the

00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:37,079
project or these give the project sort

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,110
of a sign of life it makes it look like

00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:42,300
it's active it's happening and it allows

00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:45,000
the maintainer x' to to direct the

00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:48,959
attention of people interest in the

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,110
project towards certain developments and

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,820
when I was maintaining a project back

00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,440
about seven years ago or so I found as

00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,750
one of two maintained errs the other guy

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,070
he wrote a lot of code it was great he'd

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,779
occasionally make releases with zero

00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,850
fanfare at all they'd suddenly be a new

00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:04,410
zip file appearing on SourceForge when I

00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,209
joined I started writing release notes

00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,320
every time we did one of these and I

00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:10,170
wrote up what

00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,640
and I saw downloads skyrocket people

00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,710
would see this so up in the source for

00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,690
his news feeds they newsfeed they click

00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,160
through they'd say oh oh I see there's

00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,810
there's now in this game there's now

00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,460
this new this new feature in the battle

00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:25,080
system that's really exciting go and try

00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:26,700
it out another example for things where

00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,529
we're release is take longer between

00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:31,260
times but you still want to keep people

00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:33,660
updated on what the project is doing it

00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,220
can use a change log and so sometimes

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,630
you might look at your when you hear

00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,430
change log you might think oh that's

00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,500
just like the commit blog right that's

00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:43,320
just the list of precisely every change

00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,720
that was made but change logs don't have

00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,760
to be so literal they can be documents

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,170
that are just like progress reports of

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,520
really interesting things that have

00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:53,370
happened since the last time there was a

00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:56,010
progress report and there is a GameCube

00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:59,250
emulator where my stop was stopped

00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:02,130
that's a shame there's a gamecube

00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,870
gamecube emulator called dolphin which

00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:06,570
releases monthly progress reports which

00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,670
are fantastic they list specific

00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:10,080
features that have been fixed games that

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,880
are affected they give a really

00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,440
interesting rundown on like the really

00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,089
challenging problems and they talk about

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,640
who is involved they're so good for

00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:19,589
publicity

00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,529
other things that might be good for your

00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:24,390
project so if you get lots of support

00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:25,800
questions you might start noticing that

00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:29,790
there are people asking maybe the same

00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,810
questions over and over so the first

00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,700
thing you should think of when you

00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:34,200
notice that is not oh well let's collect

00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,810
this and put this somewhere so everyone

00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,550
can find the answer is much easier you

00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:40,920
should instead be asking yourself could

00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,390
we make this question redundant could it

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,980
make it so people don't have to ask this

00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,480
question could we change a default

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,190
somehow could we change the interface

00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,070
could we add better documentation that

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:53,700
people will see if there's nothing you

00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:55,230
can do then yes collecting them in a

00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,810
document of frequently asked questions

00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:00,329
that's fine it's good it's a good thing

00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:02,220
to do but always question is there a way

00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:03,959
that you could make the process easier

00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,730
rather than saying well this is the

00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:07,730
process let's codify it

00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,290
and finally there's ideas to work on

00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,160
things like QuickStart guides so this is

00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,170
the sort of thing that you might be

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,029
tempted to say well let's just put all

00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,889
the information in the readme because

00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:21,029
people read the readme and that

00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:23,009
they can just go back and refer to it

00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:25,350
anytime it's in one central place easy

00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:28,290
to find the problem is that you end up

00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:30,089
getting something that is just getting

00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,709
longer and longer and longer and getting

00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:33,739
all these nice pieces of information

00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:36,179
that most people may not actually need

00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:37,919
so you can start moving that into

00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:40,009
separate guides and a QuickStart guide

00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,059
can often be used for the common cases

00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:43,919
but if there's a lot of information

00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:45,929
there it's good to get it out of like

00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,790
the readme and into the place for just

00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:51,540
the people that want to get a quick

00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:53,069
start developing for example so an

00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,679
example of the release times I talked

00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:57,839
about this is for the rest language and

00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,669
they release every six weeks and they

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,319
just specify like these are the things

00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:02,850
which we think are most interesting to

00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:04,529
people who would be using this new

00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,480
release of language these are the things

00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:08,579
that would probably affect people who

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,369
are using the language and might end up

00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:13,109
breaking their programs very

00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:14,519
straightforward list but it's is written

00:14:13,109 --> 00:14:16,230
in a way that's meant to be accessible

00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,089
to people outside of that core team that

00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:21,959
are making the changes and that's the

00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:24,119
important focus so you may be seeing a

00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:25,559
theme here and that is that there's

00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:27,059
going to be a lot of information

00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:29,910
especially if you're doing your job well

00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:30,989
and documenting it all that's great but

00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,299
the important point for your

00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:36,079
contributors is that you really need to

00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:39,509
walk a very fine line of giving them

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:43,499
only as much information as is actually

00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:45,540
necessary to be effective without

00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:46,860
overloading them and overwhelming them

00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,600
with the amount of information because

00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,669
that is the sort of thing that turns

00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,040
people off and that makes them question

00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:54,360
whether this is actually an effective

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,009
use of their time and whether they're

00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,269
actually cut out for this because the

00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:59,069
more things you look at when you're

00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:00,959
starting off you go that looks like I

00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:03,149
might need to learn a lot of things I'm

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:07,319
okay learning things but that's a lot of

00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:11,399
things so if you've ever looked at a bug

00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:13,259
tracker for an open-source project you

00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:16,410
probably are aware that they're not

00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:20,399
often organized the best they're not

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:22,619
often they're playgrounds for the

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,889
maintainer zuv the project to put down

00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:27,329
their ideas and often when we say things

00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:28,799
like well oh you know it's an open

00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:30,209
source project patches accepted to fix

00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,709
this problem you just reported or we say

00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:32,680
oh you want to contribute that's great

00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:34,240
we

00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,920
everything in our bun tracker that you

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,730
could work on just go find something

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,920
there have fun that's no good let me

00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:45,070
show you what Mozilla's bug tracker

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,930
looks like this is the default view if

00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,430
you click on the big Firefox logo on the

00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,630
front page and then you say oh I'm

00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,640
interested in developer tools

00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:54,940
let's see what's open there and you get

00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,200
this list which is full of jargon and

00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,420
full of things that don't mean anything

00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,520
and it's full of like all these columns

00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:04,029
and these numbers and last year we got

00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,680
160 1000 new bugs filed in like all

00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:07,930
across our bug database and it's just

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,050
it's a really terrible experience for

00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:12,160
someone who's really keen this is what

00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:14,350
you get to actually click on one of

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,910
those bugs as a new contributor you're

00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,899
like oh well I'm gonna read what this is

00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,029
about and gonna learn I'm gonna

00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:21,010
understand it and then you're like what

00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:22,600
with what is all this text what does

00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:24,850
this mean there's all these fields

00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,440
there's not even a description of like

00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:29,860
you have to scroll down past all of this

00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:32,740
introductory metadata don't do this to

00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:35,380
your new contributors I'm telling you it

00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:38,980
is a losing strategy we're gonna find

00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:41,230
ways to make this better so let's figure

00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:44,290
out how to solve the bug tracker problem

00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:46,480
for new contributors first off you need

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:48,820
to get your buy tracker in order you've

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,070
got to start organizing it and

00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,020
categorizing it so you can use things

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,820
like is this related to a certain piece

00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,580
of the code or the project let's give it

00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,900
a tag is there a certain symptom of a

00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,690
kind of problem that has been its

00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,820
exhibits is it a crash is it something

00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:05,410
that is you know can be reported by

00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,870
another tool or a style checker or

00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:10,000
something like common symptom let's tag

00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,620
it is does this require a certain

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,900
platform to reproduce or to work on

00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:16,179
let's tag it does this require a certain

00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,069
skill like if if your project uses more

00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:20,110
than one programming language maybe it's

00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:22,839
got you know part of it written in C++

00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:24,130
part of it written in Python for example

00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:27,010
like maybe you have some scripts or some

00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:28,720
tools tag those the ones to work on

00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,670
Python issues you're going to tag them

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,220
with a Python label the ones for C++ tag

00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,230
them with a C++ label this allows people

00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,660
using your bug tracker to say well I

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:41,650
don't know C++ I'm just gonna look at

00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:43,150
the ones that require Python and also I

00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,559
only have a Mac so I'm only going to

00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,530
look at the ones that say they require

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,490
you know Mac to work on

00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:52,360
this allows you to reduce the

00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:55,059
information that's really important next

00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:57,610
up we're gonna start tagging things

00:17:55,059 --> 00:18:00,340
based on whether they're appropriate for

00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:02,020
someone either like on the core team to

00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,300
work on they require lots of specialized

00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:06,910
domain knowledge or maybe they could be

00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:09,250
worked on by anybody as long as you know

00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:12,040
how to write a line of Python well you

00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,570
can probably work on this one we welcome

00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,450
you this is a great way to get an

00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:18,220
introduction to the project so many

00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:21,190
projects are now using labels they're

00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,660
like easy or good first PR or newcomers

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:24,250
welcome or like newcomers only or

00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:27,010
something something to indicate that

00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,570
this particular issue and anything else

00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:31,000
tagged with this issue or with this

00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:33,550
label is good for that class of

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,600
contributor and can usually have several

00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,160
steps here you can have like the easy

00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,990
ones could have the ones which are you

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,610
know maybe a bit harder maybe they're

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,320
good for a second step after the first

00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,520
one or maybe if you're feeling on the

00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,590
confident then you can just dive right

00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,050
into those ones it allows people to

00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,250
reduce the information and find

00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,890
something that's relevant to themselves

00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:52,000
and I use the word appropriate here

00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,820
because there are things that are

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,010
inappropriate for newcomers to work on

00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:59,080
so for example something that requires

00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:02,970
specialized knowledge or prior knowledge

00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:06,760
of the project maybe not so great for

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:10,059
newcomers to the project or if there's

00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,350
something where you know someone files

00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:12,610
it and they're like oh I bet this would

00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,470
be a good idea I bet someone could work

00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,300
on it and they forget about it and

00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,100
someone tries to and turns out it's not

00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,960
actually a good idea the contributor has

00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,270
spent you know hours days working on

00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,000
this thing and the reviewers like mmm

00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:28,050
that didn't work out all right thanks to

00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,100
the effort that's a very sad situation

00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:34,510
things that are appropriate are things

00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:40,860
that are wanted work that is desired by

00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:40,860
the rest the team yes

00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:48,010
similarly you can have things which

00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:49,900
don't actually fit that criteria but as

00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:52,630
long as there's someone who has who

00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,340
knows how it should be solved or has an

00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:56,679
idea of how to solve it and believes

00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,330
that's the right idea like that's good

00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:59,890
that's good the tag that means someone

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:03,400
has put thought into it

00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:04,960
and there is there is a there's

00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,310
structure in there that suggests how to

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,350
solve it that means someone could

00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:13,120
attempt it with proper guidance and

00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:13,690
that's great that's mentorship so what

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,420
we do next

00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:18,490
we've got tags for areas of things and

00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,410
skills ways of categorizing them

00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:23,320
we've got tags for who this is

00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:25,060
appropriate for that's good now we need

00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,330
to make sure that our issues are

00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:30,220
actually actionable right from the start

00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:32,440
because if you're keen to work on a

00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,610
project and you see oh

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,080
they've even got things that are tags

00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,490
being good for newcomers this is great

00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,610
they're ready for me and then you go

00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:41,800
into it and you read it and you're like

00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:44,890
they're using these words they don't

00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,090
understand they just say you know we

00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:49,120
should remove all the foo bars in this

00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:50,140
thing right hmm I don't know who our is

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,360
I don't know where the who bars are I

00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,220
don't know how to find food bars maybe

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,370
this isn't for me that's assuming a

00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:00,010
certain level basic of prior knowledge

00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:02,500
which may not be present so issues

00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:06,670
should have everything in them already

00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:08,500
written up to be complete to allow

00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:10,030
someone to work on it independently from

00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,160
the start without having to wait for

00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:14,890
more information that would be the ideal

00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:18,130
to aim for because every time someone

00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:20,800
has to wait for in for more information

00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:22,240
that is a chance to lose them that's a

00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,850
chance for them to say hmm I feel

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,710
uncomfortable especially if this is

00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:29,830
tagged as something like you know good

00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:32,320
first PR or easy that suggests that

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,880
they're just not up to snuff rather than

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,100
the actual the person who filed the

00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,680
issue didn't put in enough information

00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:41,020
to make it actually actionable these are

00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,730
things that can be avoided with enough

00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:45,340
diligence on the part of issue filers

00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,870
you just have the exact steps to

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,880
reproduce an issue if that's relevant

00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:50,590
you should have links to file names and

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,850
class names and function names like the

00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,830
things that will allow people to search

00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:56,230
the code and make changes links to

00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:58,810
documentation explain how to run tests

00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:01,840
that are relevant so here's an example

00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,830
of one for servo we've got my title

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,340
which wouldn't necessarily mean anything

00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:07,720
to someone but we've got a pretty good

00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,850
reputation now for being able to write

00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,990
issues that people will at least click

00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,830
through and try reading them first

00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:14,960
before giving up

00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:18,200
we say all right we have a filename here

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,240
and this is a fairly straightforward you

00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,490
know class of refactoring here we say

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,470
and it's marked as easy and it says

00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:26,480
doing to this file if you remove this

00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,670
function then you know you should just

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,020
be able to replace any users that would

00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,100
show up when you try to build again with

00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,170
this other thing which does the same

00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,450
thing it sounds fairly straightforward

00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:36,620
and I'll tell you in servo these get

00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,390
snapped up literally within hours

00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,890
because we've got a community of people

00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,740
that are always looking out for stuff

00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:45,050
like this

00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:46,520
so step after this you've got issues

00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:49,100
which are actionable that's great

00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,840
now the problem can actually turn into

00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,250
what if people show up and you have

00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,230
multiple people that want to work on the

00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:56,600
same thing you need to make sure that

00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,890
there is a way of saying this issue has

00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,690
already been claimed you'll need to find

00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:01,550
something else to work on and in a way

00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:05,240
that doesn't end up invalidating someone

00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:07,490
else's work so for our Mozilla bug

00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,920
tracker for example like we can use the

00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,330
assign field that's great and github it

00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,980
only really doesn't allow you to assign

00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:15,110
to people that are outside of your

00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,520
organization or your team so we just

00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,260
have a little label and that allows

00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,330
people to easily see oh this is marked

00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,670
as assigned I can skip it that's fine

00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:26,330
and this is also an interesting issue

00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:28,970
that was filed which is marked as less

00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:30,740
easy so it's not it's not intended

00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,230
necessarily for someone taking their

00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:35,270
first steps contributing to servo but

00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,550
it's something which when I filed it I

00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:40,310
said all right I pretty sure I know the

00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:42,110
steps involved to solve this so here's

00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:43,970
the code that needs changing here are

00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:45,230
the steps in my mind that I'm thinking

00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,450
and I looked at the code while writing

00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:49,730
this and I'm pretty sure this would be

00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,340
enough to solve it and this was claimed

00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:57,320
within I think two days and there's no a

00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:59,030
pull request to actually fix that so

00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,110
final step for making your bug tracker

00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:05,240
better you need to triage things because

00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:06,860
it's really frustrating when you have an

00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,110
issue that contains everything that

00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,670
needs to be acted upon and it's marked

00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:12,140
as being good for beginners and someone

00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:13,730
shows up they're like yes I can do this

00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,990
I have all the skills required this

00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,700
issue make sense to me and they go

00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:21,320
looking and like the file mention

00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:22,940
doesn't exist anymore now what and all

00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,710
that enthusiasm just disappears right

00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,820
there because they have to wait for more

00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:28,470
updates so if you make it

00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,940
process to actually go through your

00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,630
triage things you say is this actually

00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,419
still valid

00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:34,860
can we still reproduce this if someone

00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:36,000
said they're working on it are they

00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,730
actually still working on it have they

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,230
gone dormant check in with them and is

00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:42,269
this actually still good for a newcomer

00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,590
because sometimes you have something you

00:24:42,269 --> 00:24:44,909
file it you're like oh I'm pretty sure I

00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:47,090
know what the solution is I'll write it

00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:49,529
down and then someone tries it and

00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:50,880
something happens and they give up so

00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:53,070
another person comes along and like oh

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,080
it's not assigned I'll take it they try

00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:57,870
it maybe they disappear someone else

00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,549
comes along they try it doesn't work

00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,840
suddenly you've got this long chain of

00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:02,009
comments of people saying like yes I'm

00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,049
gonna work on this and maybe there's

00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:06,029
questions in there and it just it

00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:08,309
doesn't look approachable anymore or

00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:09,779
maybe it actually is harder than you

00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:12,870
thought and maybe it's not actually

00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:14,190
appropriate for a brand new newcomer and

00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,899
that's ok you can get you can change

00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:17,549
these things but it's important to just

00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:19,230
stay on top of the ball and make sure

00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:22,710
you are keeping this ask these things

00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:26,789
correctly because that person's that

00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:28,549
first impression is so important it's

00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:31,649
when people first see your project and

00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:33,360
there's always that sense of am I good

00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:34,769
enough to this project I'm interested

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,409
that's why I'm attempting to contribute

00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:40,529
I want to get something out of it but if

00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:44,250
it doesn't give back there's no reason

00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:46,940
to stick around so you prioritize useful

00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:50,399
information let's talk about friction

00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:52,200
friction in the context of an

00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:53,370
open-source project are all the things

00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,919
that can go wrong when you're a new

00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:57,899
contributor it's the things that happen

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,090
that are out of your control you follow

00:25:57,899 --> 00:26:03,149
instructions and something doesn't work

00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:05,820
has anyone ever tried to set up a

00:26:03,149 --> 00:26:07,049
project that had a list of like you need

00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,730
to install these things or you're just

00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:11,850
like you need to run this compile in

00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:14,309
command and it'll just work and like

00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,690
something doesn't compile a flag is

00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:18,360
wrong you're missing a dependency like

00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:21,179
something that feels like I followed the

00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:23,490
instructions and they like I can't do

00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:27,360
anything without asking someone else and

00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:29,190
that's really disheartening similarly if

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,529
your project says using a Mac that's

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,240
great you can either use homebrew or Mac

00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:35,399
ports in order to install your

00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,110
prerequisite libraries to someone who

00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:39,779
doesn't know what either of Mac ports or

00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:40,740
homebrew is they now have to make a

00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:43,620
choice and they don't

00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,850
they don't have any reason to choose one

00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,980
over the other but they have to this is

00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,960
disheartening this is intimidating like

00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,090
what if you make the wrong choice who

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,820
knows these are things you should try to

00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:56,040
eliminate this is friction anytime you

00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,030
have to ask to wait for someone or any

00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,440
time you have to ask someone for

00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:01,010
something and you need to wait on them

00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,870
and you don't know how long

00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:07,760
risky business there there is research

00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:10,650
showing that the first 24 hours after a

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,740
after a first contribution is so

00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:16,980
important because after that 24 hours if

00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:19,620
there's been no contact with anyone like

00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,630
on the receiving end there the chances

00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:24,840
of a repeated contribution after that

00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:26,309
point go way down it's that initial

00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,690
window that needs to set expectations

00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:32,040
properly similarly if you like every

00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,690
time you're trying to contribute to a

00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,790
project and there's some skill you don't

00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:38,010
have that it says you need that's a

00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:39,600
piece of friction you might end up with

00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:42,030
someone who is really keen to learn new

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,230
things and that's great but every time

00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,000
you have something which is different

00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,130
than the norm different than their prior

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,380
experiences you have a chance of losing

00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:51,600
them and every time someone does

00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:54,770
something for your project and you throw

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,780
it away that is friction that is saying

00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:59,760
you did you did stuff for us but we

00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:04,020
don't value it that is something that

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:08,880
needs to be avoided so the ways we can

00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:11,790
do that are build tools that understand

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,190
failure and suggest ways to fix it

00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:16,110
so whether it's you know instead of a

00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:17,850
list of shell commands to run to install

00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:20,309
things you write a script that does that

00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,690
instead that can watch for any errors

00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:23,490
that occur and print out a message

00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:25,080
saying hey why don't you email our

00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:28,200
mailing list with the output from this

00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,730
thing or even suggest or even like tries

00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,130
to fix it yourself like there are ways

00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:36,830
to avoid or to make the failure case

00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:39,750
less disturbing and disheartening and

00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:41,760
similarly anytime you have a choice

00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,990
between one piece of technology which

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,970
already exists in your project and

00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,590
americo requires skills that already

00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:49,410
existing projects and another one which

00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:51,240
you'd require different skills try to

00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:52,809
standardize on the things you already

00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,220
use rather than

00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:55,990
introducing another thing because you

00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:59,350
need to weigh the risks of requiring

00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:02,379
additional skillsets versus being able

00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:04,600
to make do with the existing ones so as

00:29:02,379 --> 00:29:05,409
an example of setting expectations

00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,889
properly

00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:11,620
I built a bot for github which we'll

00:29:08,889 --> 00:29:12,820
watch for new pull requests from new

00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,889
contributors someone who has never

00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,870
contributed before and if there is one

00:29:14,889 --> 00:29:19,509
the first thing I see is a message from

00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:21,669
the spot that says thank you we're gonna

00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:23,649
look at it soon we really are excited to

00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:25,840
review your changes and then it also

00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:28,210
pings someone in the core team to make

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,749
sure that even if somehow we totally

00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:32,980
overlooked this this pull request

00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:35,440
someone's gonna get an email who is

00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:38,429
ostensibly on the core team and will

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,929
respond to this it's a way to avoid

00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:42,700
overlooking these things similarly if

00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:44,860
you have like an IRC channel some sort

00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,259
of chat room you could have a bot which

00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:49,210
will look for someone new the shows up

00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:51,369
ask the question and doesn't get a

00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,539
response in like 15 minutes or something

00:29:51,369 --> 00:29:54,070
and says hey it looks like everyone's

00:29:52,539 --> 00:29:55,779
busy why don't you try emailing your

00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,009
mailing list or something these are

00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:59,769
tools we can build to avoid these

00:29:57,009 --> 00:30:03,580
problems so let's talk about

00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:07,740
expectations expectations are very

00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:11,679
important because you can do things that

00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:13,509
would usually be bad practices like not

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,429
respond for a long time as long as you

00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:18,429
set it up ahead of time so people know

00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:19,629
what to expect so if you're contributing

00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:22,570
thing you say well we're all pretty busy

00:30:19,629 --> 00:30:24,309
we're volunteers so you know we expect

00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:26,710
we'll review any new contributions

00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:27,879
within a week of them arriving that's

00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:30,639
just the way it works and people will be

00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:32,559
like alright thanks for telling me so

00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:34,659
you can say like how difficult something

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,639
is you can say like I expect this to be

00:30:34,659 --> 00:30:37,779
a hard project but for someone who wants

00:30:36,639 --> 00:30:40,059
to take that on I'm willing to help you

00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:41,409
rather than saying this is a really

00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:42,789
exciting project I'm willing to help you

00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:43,840
and people show up you're like yes this

00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:45,369
sounds really exciting and then they

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,409
don't have any idea of how hard that

00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:48,759
actually will be if there's a deadline

00:30:47,409 --> 00:30:50,559
on something you should make that clear

00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:52,119
because it really sucks if someone who's

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,100
working on something and then you're

00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:56,619
like sorry too late we needed this

00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:59,350
yesterday so I did it that's - that's

00:30:56,619 --> 00:31:02,409
not valuing their time and additionally

00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:03,789
if there is a certain standard of

00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:06,100
behavior you want for your project

00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:06,669
community code of conduct that's the way

00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,440
to go about it

00:31:06,669 --> 00:31:10,359
you lay out your expectations you say

00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,730
this is the way people in this community

00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:14,019
are going to behave if they don't then

00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:16,330
yes we will exclude them from the

00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:18,340
community and that set expectations that

00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:22,779
allows people to know what is expected

00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:24,999
of them so as an example as I mentioned

00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:27,369
there's one time when I was on vacation

00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:29,379
and I would I'd get emails when like

00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:30,460
things appeared on github someone

00:31:29,379 --> 00:31:31,059
submitted a pull request to one of my

00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,859
projects

00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:34,239
so I decided all right I'll write a

00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:36,460
little message saying you know I can't

00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:38,139
do this now but please let me know if I

00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,779
forget about this by the time I should

00:31:38,139 --> 00:31:42,879
have done it it's great people

00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:47,789
understand that people appreciate

00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:51,220
communication it turns out so

00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:53,379
expectations great now let's talk about

00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:57,820
responding and funding appropriately to

00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:59,919
things so as I said research 24 hours

00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:01,659
after a first contribution shows that

00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:04,840
you really need to minimize that time

00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:07,289
it's okay to set up expectations to do

00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:10,059
differently as long as those are there

00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:11,590
so for for changes you get that don't

00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:12,879
meet a certain amount minimum bar

00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,950
quality if you're working with a

00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:16,509
contributor and like making suggestions

00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:18,039
for how to improve their changes and

00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:19,269
like they're just not getting it over

00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:21,730
and over and you feel this is no longer

00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:24,489
a valuable use of my time to continue

00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:27,039
doing this then yeah it's okay to to

00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:29,049
take their changes make the fixes you

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,399
want yourself and say all right thanks

00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:31,480
thanks for your contribution I

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,340
acknowledge the time you spent on it

00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,019
it's really helpful I made these

00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,369
following changes take a look and see

00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,840
what you think of them and just merge

00:32:36,369 --> 00:32:40,509
them in yourself close that pull request

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,789
or that bug whatever that's a way to

00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:45,720
gracefully acknowledge that some

00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:47,710
contributions are not quite enough but

00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,859
acknowledging that time was spent on

00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:52,509
them and that time is valuable

00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:54,369
additionally if someone makes a change

00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:56,649
that is not actually one you want to

00:32:54,369 --> 00:32:58,749
accept period it's outside the scope of

00:32:56,649 --> 00:33:01,539
the project then it's okay to say that

00:32:58,749 --> 00:33:03,759
but it's even better to state that

00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:05,830
upfront in your roadmap somewhere else

00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:08,259
and make it clear from the from the

00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:10,359
get-go so that people don't feel

00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:14,950
blindsided by this after putting time

00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:17,470
into it so there are certain hacks you

00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:19,570
can do with communicating with people to

00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,679
make the process better - one thing I

00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:24,190
really like for

00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:26,169
viewing code is I write out a code I

00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:28,690
write out a comment about someone's code

00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:31,929
I say oh you know this line I I think

00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:33,190
that you know I think that you could do

00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:35,559
it more efficiently this way or

00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:38,019
something and then every single time

00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:40,720
right before I publish I go through and

00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:45,429
I do a complete global find the replace

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:47,320
of you with we and your with our and

00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:49,539
it's amazing what a difference it makes

00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,190
because it suddenly turns something that

00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:54,309
is almost confrontational saying your

00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:55,840
code is not good enough you should make

00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:57,909
this change you should do it more

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,309
efficiently and instead it says this is

00:33:57,909 --> 00:34:02,919
a shared project this is our code I

00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:05,440
think together we can do something more

00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:08,340
efficiently this way and it just changes

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,340
the whole tone of the conversation

00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:16,540
saying thank you super important always

00:34:14,169 --> 00:34:24,579
do that acknowledging contribution is

00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:26,169
very very important so after the

00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:29,079
appropriate response we've got the

00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:31,780
follow-through let's talk about that

00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:33,849
means so as I said recognition of

00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:35,679
contribution not just saying thank you

00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:40,690
to someone for the contribution that's

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:42,549
really important that's good but the

00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:46,929
system that we talked about so far have

00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:50,079
set up a really really good mechanism

00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:52,179
for getting many sets of first

00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:55,059
contributions to your project but they

00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:59,250
don't necessarily set us up for second

00:34:55,059 --> 00:35:02,319
contributions or repeated ones so

00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:03,730
there's there's a way to do that and the

00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:05,559
way to do that is when someone makes a

00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:07,690
contribution they're already invested

00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:10,990
you can capitalize on that you can say

00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:12,280
thanks your contribution if you'd like a

00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:14,640
suggestion for something else you could

00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,390
work on I'd be happy to help with that

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,250
that's great it gives them the

00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:19,240
opportunity to decline or gives them the

00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,400
opportunity say yeah I'm really

00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,500
interested in continuing and I don't

00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,270
necessarily know what to do next and as

00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,730
a maintainer every person who

00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:30,309
contributes is a possible future

00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:31,510
maintainer you should nurture that you

00:35:30,309 --> 00:35:34,099
should look at it and you should say

00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:36,259
okay what are they worked on what skill

00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:38,210
they learned what could we help develop

00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:39,529
is there an area of the code that they

00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,880
now have more experience with that they

00:35:39,529 --> 00:35:42,229
could continue working on are there

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,509
things that we have previously filed

00:35:42,229 --> 00:35:46,579
which are categorized for that same area

00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:48,289
where you can use all of these skills

00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:49,309
we've built so far and we can say hey

00:35:48,289 --> 00:35:51,259
why don't you work on this other thing

00:35:49,309 --> 00:35:53,499
that's related and that gives them a

00:35:51,259 --> 00:35:56,960
stepping-stone to get better and better

00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:59,239
these are the ways to develop positive

00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,549
relationships with contributors valuing

00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:03,019
their time and pointing out that you

00:36:01,549 --> 00:36:05,239
understand the skills that they're

00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:07,729
gaining through this and that you would

00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:10,220
like to help develop almost a mentorship

00:36:07,729 --> 00:36:12,319
that is what successful development of

00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:14,509
repeat contributions looks like it's

00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:16,700
saying I understand the value that you

00:36:14,509 --> 00:36:18,920
bring to this organization this team

00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:25,670
this project and I would like to help

00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:27,259
you maximize that so altogether we have

00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,999
now helped people get involved quickly

00:36:27,259 --> 00:36:30,410
and we've helped them have a positive

00:36:28,999 --> 00:36:32,930
experience by following all the previous

00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:37,640
steps however we now need to market our

00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:41,719
project so how do we actually find

00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:43,969
people to look at the issues we filed so

00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:45,200
there's a feedback cycle if you start

00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:47,269
getting people contributing to your

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,119
project word gets out if they have

00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:51,469
positive experiences or negative ones

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,390
there is a whisperer network of people

00:36:51,469 --> 00:36:55,039
saying hey yeah I really enjoyed working

00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:57,289
on this thing I'll tell my friends about

00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:59,779
it I'll tell this University class about

00:36:57,289 --> 00:37:02,269
it like this is how word spreads if you

00:36:59,779 --> 00:37:06,319
have a really positive and invaluable

00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:09,589
experience contributing there's also

00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:11,420
tools for getting these pieces of work

00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:12,829
out into the eyes of people that might

00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,380
want to be able to or that might be able

00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:18,049
to do them for example there's a site

00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:20,239
called issue hub IO which allows you to

00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:23,869
say well I'm interested in any issues

00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:25,729
that require this language and you can

00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:27,559
say oh okay I'm looking for anything

00:37:25,729 --> 00:37:29,180
like I wanted to work on documentation

00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:32,329
for a github project that requires this

00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:34,819
language and then it'll show you like

00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:36,349
all of the issues filed with the

00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:38,660
documentation tag that are in projects

00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:39,710
for that language or you might be like

00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,539
well anything that's marked as a

00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:43,430
beginner that sounds like me and I want

00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:43,969
to do Ruby or JavaScript this is really

00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,469
convenient

00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:47,920
it just shows up there automatically if

00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:50,329
you have the right tags on github

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:54,530
similarly Firefox has a Twitter account

00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:57,020
called start Mozilla which is used to

00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:58,250
take our ones which are marked and take

00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:01,250
our bugs which are marked as being good

00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:02,510
for beginners often and giving a really

00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:06,260
brief description to get people

00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:07,730
interested and linked to them and last I

00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,319
heard like often these were being

00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:10,849
claimed within like a day or two of

00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:12,980
posting these because they've got an

00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:14,000
audience of like a thousand more than a

00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,200
thousand people that are just watching

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,890
the Twitter feed and they just come

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:21,140
through it's great similarly there's

00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:22,550
another one called your first PR which

00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,290
is written by someone who really likes

00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:26,000
helping people get started in open

00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:27,740
source projects and so they started

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,390
curating these lists of issues for

00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:31,460
projects looking for the ones which have

00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,990
all the information required which don't

00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,329
require specialized domain knowledge and

00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:37,609
every day they post a new one that says

00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:42,530
hey you could contribute to this project

00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:44,150
which requires these skills there's

00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:46,010
another website called up for grabs

00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:47,270
which basically if you submit your

00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:48,940
project there there's in there's

00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:51,559
instructions the very bottom of the page

00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:53,119
then it'll appear on this big list of

00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:54,530
projects which claimed that they would

00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,809
like new contributors and they have

00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:58,910
issues which are B which are marked as

00:38:56,809 --> 00:39:02,180
available for new contributors that's

00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:04,760
great and for Firefox as I showed

00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:06,770
earlier our bug tracker is not newcomer

00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,130
friendly so I wrote an alternative view

00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:12,920
which would only find issues which were

00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:14,450
marked as having a mentor and in

00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,460
particular you can also say I only want

00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:18,440
ones which are good for beginners and

00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:21,079
that's the the display only seen only

00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,190
simple bugs that's what that filters and

00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:24,740
you can say I'm only interested in

00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:26,150
things that you know require like

00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,710
networking knowledge or like working in

00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:30,549
the networking code and stuff with

00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:33,109
accessibility and you can also filter by

00:39:30,549 --> 00:39:34,880
you know I only know C++ or Java Script

00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:37,069
this is a way of reducing the

00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,890
information and making it into a much

00:39:37,069 --> 00:39:43,400
more relevant view for newcomers that's

00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:45,380
less intimidating I also wrote a site

00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,240
called what can I do for Mozilla org

00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,559
which is another way of looking at it

00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,270
people have sometimes come to me and

00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:52,970
instead of they wouldn't necessarily

00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:55,040
want to be given just any task that was

00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:57,829
available they want to say what team can

00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,270
I join I know these languages so I built

00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:00,890
a site which said which will allow you

00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:03,049
to filter down by what your skills

00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:04,430
and then say oh these teams are looking

00:40:03,049 --> 00:40:07,880
for people with those skills and these

00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:11,869
these have links to getting involved

00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:13,789
with those particular teams instead so

00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:15,829
those are specific tools for publicizing

00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:17,299
the work that's available you can also

00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:19,789
do things like go to Tech Talks

00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:22,940
or like give Tech Talks at meetups that

00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:25,069
are related to the skills you need but

00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:27,499
the important thing here is when you

00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:28,309
find a potential audience or when you

00:40:27,499 --> 00:40:30,499
find an audience of potential

00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:32,119
contributors the really important thing

00:40:30,499 --> 00:40:36,339
is pitching your project in the right

00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:38,690
way it's not enough to just say you know

00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:42,619
this is a JavaScript prop or this is a

00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:44,359
project that uses JavaScript and it does

00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:46,880
like shared collaborative editing or

00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:49,180
something we're open source you should

00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,960
help us because that doesn't actually

00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,400
that's addressing it from the

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,599
maintainers viewpoint saying these are

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,119
the skills that people need in order to

00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:58,849
join us but it's not actually providing

00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:00,529
a good reason for someone else to say oh

00:40:58,849 --> 00:41:03,710
that sounds like something I could help

00:41:00,529 --> 00:41:06,049
with pitching the project requires

00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:07,369
saying like what are they going to get

00:41:06,049 --> 00:41:09,019
out of this experience why would they

00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:10,489
want to contribute are they going to be

00:41:09,019 --> 00:41:12,140
able to develop a skill by contributing

00:41:10,489 --> 00:41:14,539
are they going to be able to learn about

00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:16,579
something new that they don't know about

00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:17,720
yet or are they going to be able to make

00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:19,190
use of something which might be a bit

00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:22,249
nice but they're actually really good at

00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:24,470
or excited by so finding the right way

00:41:22,249 --> 00:41:25,880
to describe your project to people and

00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:27,799
describe why it would actually be a

00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,329
valuable experience for them to spend

00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:34,690
their time contributing to your project

00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:37,880
is the key takeaway here so that's it

00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:40,069
you've now learned the steps required in

00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:43,910
order to make your project accessible

00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:45,380
and interesting and not or and reduce

00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,849
the bounce rate of people showing up and

00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,710
you're like whoa this looks like

00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:50,569
something I don't know how to do can't

00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:53,660
learn how to do and turn it into

00:41:50,569 --> 00:41:55,789
something which originally might have

00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,289
looked like a mountain but now is

00:41:55,789 --> 00:42:00,769
actually a waterslide and then just

00:41:57,289 --> 00:42:03,609
shoot right down so thank you I'd love

00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:03,609
to hear if any questions you have

00:42:07,339 --> 00:42:31,829
yes that's a really good question and

00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,859
the question was how do you build in an

00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:38,759
incentive for the people who are part of

00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:40,470
the core team to actually like want to

00:42:38,759 --> 00:42:42,150
bring in new contributors and putting

00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:44,640
this effort because yes in his effort

00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:47,430
this is actually taking away from time

00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,809
you could spend writing code and you're

00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:50,369
putting it towards as wishing watching

00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:53,460
an idea of having other people write

00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:54,829
code instead which I mean some people

00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:57,809
like refer to that as a force multiplier

00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:59,730
and using that using that analogy you

00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:03,269
could say like as a core maintainer of a

00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:06,869
project like it depends on on what you

00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:08,130
want to do if you focus on me personally

00:43:06,869 --> 00:43:09,839
I have these skills I'm going to use

00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:12,990
these skills to advance this project and

00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:16,680
that is my television like that is an OK

00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:18,089
view point to have but I argue if you

00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,039
have people who are thinking about the

00:43:18,089 --> 00:43:21,990
longer-term goals of the project I'm

00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:23,160
saying this is where we want to be these

00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:26,160
are the things we need to do to get

00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:28,680
there you can look at it and say well it

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,059
may take us like two years in order to

00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:33,210
get there if we do these things by

00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:34,890
ourselves but if we could find X many

00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,960
other people to help us do these things

00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:38,220
think how much less time that could take

00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:44,089
how much more things we could accomplish

00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:46,349
that way so I mean being a model of

00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:48,599
bringing in new contributors and showing

00:43:46,349 --> 00:43:50,670
what contributors outside contributors

00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:53,099
can do for your project that's a fine

00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:54,660
way to demonstrate that and like be a

00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:57,539
role model for the people in your team

00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:59,130
that's one way but yeah making make the

00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:01,619
pragmatic argument that like there's all

00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:04,230
this stuff that like we need to do and

00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:07,200
there's only so many of us and so much

00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:09,869
time like that's I think to me that's

00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,769
compelling argument of why it's worth

00:44:09,869 --> 00:44:12,769
putting in this investment

00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,460
yes

00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:37,039
neither is there a way to

00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:50,730
that's a good question and the question

00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:52,620
was are there examples of models where

00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:56,490
you have a really small core team with a

00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:57,720
much larger wider sort community of

00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:58,520
support developers and people who are

00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,750
not necessarily not necessarily

00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:03,270
contributing like regularly or

00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:03,960
continuously but are there to like get

00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:12,090
things done

00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:13,230
right so I mean one one of these or the

00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:14,730
other part of the question was like is

00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:17,160
there a model to show like this and

00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:18,930
actually done effectively I believe so

00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,430
first thing I think the project I

00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:23,300
mentioned earlier Scerbo which is

00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:25,230
developing a brand new web browser

00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:28,680
written in a new programming language

00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:34,620
where we have seven full-time employees

00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:36,180
I believe we've got over 300 non

00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:38,340
employee contributors who have

00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:40,590
contributed in the past two and a half

00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:41,880
years I believe and the majority of

00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:46,110
those have been in the past year and a

00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,500
half it certainly takes effort to manage

00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:51,800
that

00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:54,950
but getting on to a model serving stop

00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:58,710
getting getting to a model where people

00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:59,910
file issues proactively where they have

00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:01,680
an idea of something that could be done

00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:03,000
and instead of like writing it down

00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,040
somewhere and saying oh goes on my to-do

00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,930
list if you put it out there you

00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,910
describe what you want done market in

00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:12,050
appropriate ways that can give people

00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:12,050
ideas for things to work on

00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:19,430
and that's that certainly model that we

00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:22,320
call one servo for other projects with

00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:23,730
similar success stories I would argue

00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,720
that there's certainly been a very long

00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:28,470
period of time where that's been true

00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:31,680
for Firefox where there was a you know

00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:34,620
fairly comparatively small core team and

00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:38,040
much larger sort of army of volunteers

00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:40,760
who would do occasional contribution or

00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,760
infrequent

00:46:40,809 --> 00:46:47,319
but yes certainly managing that is is

00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:49,450
challenging and I don't I don't know

00:46:47,319 --> 00:46:52,349
that there is a one size fits all

00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:52,349
strategy for that right now

00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,480
yes you're back

00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:34,190
really I would I mean when possible as

00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:37,820
an as a project maintainer you should

00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:40,540
adhere to existing practices so if

00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:43,490
you're starting a new project then if

00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:45,470
you if you care more about being

00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:47,630
efficient in your own model then that's

00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:49,520
fine and codifying that the document

00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:52,220
saying this is the recommended supported

00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,660
way of developing the project like

00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:58,220
that's fine setting expectations like I

00:47:53,660 --> 00:48:00,619
said but similarly looking at what

00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:02,839
people knew already and trying to go

00:48:00,619 --> 00:48:06,530
with the most common way of doing that

00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:08,540
like that's usually going to be the path

00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:10,670
of least resistance I'm if someone comes

00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:14,530
in and refuses to work in that model I

00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:16,910
mean you have two options one is like if

00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:19,040
if the models are incompatible you

00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:20,930
cannot actually set contributions from

00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,970
them if they continue doing that like

00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:24,680
you don't really have a choice unless

00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:28,640
you choose to change your practices to

00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:30,740
accommodate that but really like saying

00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,119
we recommend doing it this way and we

00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:36,500
can answer questions by doing it this

00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:38,829
way seems like it's fine to me your

00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,829
question

00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:01,039
the question was as the open source

00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:04,069
community is growing rapidly news days

00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:05,869
do we foresee and sort of imbalance

00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:06,859
between the number of maintained errs in

00:49:05,869 --> 00:49:09,499
the future and the number of

00:49:06,859 --> 00:49:11,239
contributors with the idea being that

00:49:09,499 --> 00:49:12,680
there wouldn't be enough contributors to

00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:14,119
different projects or would it be

00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:16,219
reversed there'd be not enough

00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:21,559
maintainer for projects not enough

00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:24,759
contributors for projects I it's unclear

00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:27,710
I think I think both of those holes are

00:49:24,759 --> 00:49:29,630
problematic I think for the maintainer

00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:31,700
when it sort of depends how people look

00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:33,999
at this because I am a strong advocate

00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:36,920
for giving different contributors

00:49:33,999 --> 00:49:40,390
privileges as soon as possible as there

00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:42,650
was it make sense to do so it's

00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:46,430
difficult to make changes in open source

00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:48,259
project that are totally reputable and

00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:50,059
therefore give me someone keeping access

00:49:48,259 --> 00:49:52,130
your project is a way of bringing them

00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:54,890
in and saying hey I trust you to make

00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:55,729
changes and I also trust you to ask me

00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:57,710
if there's things that you're unsure

00:49:55,729 --> 00:50:00,440
about rather than keeping people at

00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:01,880
arm's length and saying well you know I

00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,950
am the only gatekeeper here and

00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,900
therefore making everything pass through

00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:07,910
yourself like that is a form of

00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:10,249
limitation of your project and a

00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:12,529
limitation of the the resources that

00:50:10,249 --> 00:50:14,119
could be available to you these people

00:50:12,529 --> 00:50:17,019
have more privileges will feel more

00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:19,579
involved and will feel stronger about

00:50:17,019 --> 00:50:22,549
maintaining the products like maintainer

00:50:19,579 --> 00:50:24,979
x' don't have to be like absolute core

00:50:22,549 --> 00:50:26,989
developers that are there setting the

00:50:24,979 --> 00:50:29,509
goals and deciding the future they can

00:50:26,989 --> 00:50:30,979
be people who perform very useful tasks

00:50:29,509 --> 00:50:31,960
for your project they give me the people

00:50:30,979 --> 00:50:34,300
they do tree operate

00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,770
the people that do documentation for

00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,870
your projects they can be people that

00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:39,550
localize things and translate them they

00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:42,340
can be people that are not even

00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:44,560
technical but have a good idea but have

00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:45,850
a good sense of how to work with the

00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:49,150
community how to work with people

00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:52,020
communicate like I think maintain ership

00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:55,390
can be a larger role than many people

00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:59,680
really give credence to and when it

00:50:55,390 --> 00:51:01,710
comes to a lack of contributors it's

00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:06,750
hard to say whether that's really a

00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:08,410
problem I think like people who are

00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:10,300
already in the open-source community

00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:11,470
it's easier for them to be contributors

00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,880
on other projects so they've got the

00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:14,800
experience people coming in from the

00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,120
from the outside like that number seems

00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,030
to be continuously growing as we're

00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:54,310
doing more outreach it doesn't seem like

00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:57,040
that'll really be a problem it's a good

00:51:54,310 --> 00:52:00,070
question and the question was if you

00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:02,500
open the doors wide and let in all sorts

00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:04,210
of changes or at least the possibility

00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:06,910
of all sorts of changes how do you

00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:09,430
manage sort of the growth of code from a

00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:11,680
very technical standpoint just getting

00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:13,690
more and more code if it becomes less

00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,130
elegant less maintainable as a result

00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:18,220
like how do you manage that with a

00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:19,840
larger crowd of contributors and to me I

00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:21,970
found a really interesting thing with

00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:24,340
the servo project in particular is that

00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:25,720
I have taught myself but anytime I

00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,220
notice something in the code that looks

00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,050
like it could be improved in a way that

00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:32,100
I can describe instead of doing it

00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:35,140
myself a final issue I mark it as

00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:36,580
refactoring and you know it's probably

00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:38,560
probably good for a newcomer and I

00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:40,480
scribe what I want the outcome to be and

00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,800
then I go off from scrap forget about it

00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,410
and a couple days later there's a pull

00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:48,420
request to fix it and that's a really

00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:51,160
effective way to manage changes that

00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:54,040
it's like weeding the garden it allows

00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:56,230
people who don't have that that inside

00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:58,090
knowledge of the code base already to

00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:59,950
just come in and do very focused

00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:02,290
specific improvements to keep it

00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:05,620
maintainable I think personally to me

00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:10,030
that that seems like the most affordable

00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:11,650
system when numbers increase yeah I

00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:12,940
think self-discipline I know a lot of

00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:14,320
people who are just they see something

00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,300
in the code like alright I can fix that

00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:18,880
I know how to do that but as a

00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:20,470
maintainer I feel if you have the

00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,030
knowledge to do more complex things I

00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:23,620
think it's worth using that knowledge

00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:25,990
and focusing on the more complex things

00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:28,480
and leaving the stuff that doesn't

00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:32,640
require that background knowledge to

00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,640
people that can make better use of it

00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,570
okay there were two questions their

00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:05,920
person was if I let me to start my own

00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:07,300
project and invite other people to

00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,340
contribute to it what do you recommend

00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:10,990
that I start working on it by myself in

00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:12,070
my assortment in my own office before

00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:21,600
sharing it with the world

00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:21,600
and second question but great

00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:28,450
yes the second question was about

00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:32,860
posting requirements so address in the

00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:34,840
first one I would say personally I am a

00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:38,110
fan of like release early release often

00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:40,420
so I I personally have no shame about

00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:42,310
releasing my code into the wild I have

00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:44,770
really so many pieces of code which are

00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:47,230
entirely half-baked and I've described

00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:48,940
what I what my vision for them is with

00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:50,490
the hope steps anyone else might come

00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:52,450
along to see it and share that vision

00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:54,670
and actually one of the websites I've

00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:56,650
showed there I released very early it

00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:58,240
was very ugly as a webpage because what

00:54:56,650 --> 00:55:00,730
can I do from a solid org it was

00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:04,030
strictly text-based with really awful

00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:05,590
little oval buttons and then because I

00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:07,600
release it and shared it around

00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:09,010
I got a confirmation from someone who is

00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,630
a designer who said hey I can make it

00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:12,340
better and he added great hints and

00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:15,190
background pictures and colors it was

00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:16,960
great so personally I think getting over

00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:18,790
that that fear that you might really

00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,400
something which isn't good enough is

00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:24,310
really important to work on managing I

00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:25,660
think sharing really is important ask

00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:27,400
the second question about posting

00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:29,950
requirements whether it's good to have a

00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:32,410
website where how important that is I

00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:35,320
think having a web presence is a great

00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:37,480
way to to be an invitation for me to

00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:39,850
take part and have that information up

00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,140
front about what your goals are etc and

00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:43,420
I think there are there are tools like

00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:46,300
github pages where it's fairly

00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:49,210
straightforward these days to to

00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:51,460
actually set up a web presence without

00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:54,210
too much effort or domain knowledge so I

00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:54,210
think it's pretty important

00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:58,290
one last question I guess

00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:49,910
that's an interesting question and the

00:56:47,719 --> 00:56:52,039
question was are basically are there

00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:53,749
projects which are too big and too

00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:57,170
established to be able to actually

00:56:53,749 --> 00:57:01,819
change to follow the the techniques I

00:56:57,170 --> 00:57:03,709
described in this talk it's very

00:57:01,819 --> 00:57:07,400
interesting because I have actually been

00:57:03,709 --> 00:57:10,130
working on instituting these in like

00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:13,640
especially in Firefox in particular over

00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:14,869
the past four years that's when I really

00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:19,160
started getting interested in this and

00:57:14,869 --> 00:57:21,289
started developing these techniques I

00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:23,539
think as a whole it can be difficult to

00:57:21,289 --> 00:57:25,969
talk about organizations like that

00:57:23,539 --> 00:57:26,959
I think breaking them down into actual

00:57:25,969 --> 00:57:29,509
individual projects

00:57:26,959 --> 00:57:30,680
it's much easier to talk about do we

00:57:29,509 --> 00:57:31,819
can't get enough leverage in this

00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:34,279
project to change the way they're

00:57:31,819 --> 00:57:34,999
operating and encourage these these

00:57:34,279 --> 00:57:37,009
better techniques

00:57:34,999 --> 00:57:38,779
I think certainly for new projects

00:57:37,009 --> 00:57:41,329
inside these organizations it's much

00:57:38,779 --> 00:57:43,190
easier to do so for more established

00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:45,109
ones like Firefox for example inside

00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:46,729
Mozilla it's very difficult because

00:57:45,109 --> 00:57:48,619
there's such a diverse set of

00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:51,380
contributors that it's difficult to

00:57:48,619 --> 00:57:53,359
actually reach them all and share the

00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:56,900
motivation behind these changes that

00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:58,459
we're suggesting certainly I think it is

00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:00,680
possible for projects to be a stuck

00:57:58,459 --> 00:58:04,190
interrupt and and not being able to

00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:06,709
follow these effectively I think it's it

00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:08,420
requires avoiding that requires getting

00:58:06,709 --> 00:58:10,249
enough mind share of the people were

00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:12,079
strongly invested in that and can make

00:58:10,249 --> 00:58:14,479
the changes themselves to just

00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:15,789
eventually get enough developers in the

00:58:14,479 --> 00:58:18,199
ranks that do follow these practices

00:58:15,789 --> 00:58:22,989
that you have something approaching

00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:22,989
these best practices the question

00:58:24,839 --> 00:58:26,900
