our other campus drug has been there

00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:13,469
since 1994 professor math and program

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:18,510
I'll let you do the math figure out how

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:21,630
long it's been since 94 he used an

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,960
electrical engineer by training home do

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:28,140
skills in IBM for what you say about 10

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,060
years in the hardware side many years

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,140
also in the software side of databases

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:37,260
and what he but what you really want you

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,390
to know is that he's now in addition to

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:44,390
all of this other wonderful experience

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,390
earned is great hair is Grandfather

00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,879
duggan i agree that our respective

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:59,989
grandchildren are the most wonderful

00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:15,119
that's right equal mass right absolutely

00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:16,830
thank you well thanks for that as you

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,170
mentioned I spent a long time in IBM

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,930
before doing career switches here and I

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,759
just want to share with you how i came

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,299
to do such a career switch from

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,939
essentially being an electrical engineer

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,210
and a manager protector within IBM

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:36,119
hardware and software development

00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:39,150
because when I was in my 20s I wanted to

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:43,409
see the world so I ended up taking a

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:46,229
contract in teaching in east africa in

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,119
kenya in nairobi and i did that because

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:50,549
i wanted to travel and that was a good

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,290
chance to do so etc etc I didn't do it

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:56,700
because I wanted to be a teacher as such

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:58,680
or because I thought that even that

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,360
would be any part in my career and when

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,520
I got back to Canada after that time

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,170
which was a great experience by the way

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:09,000
I went into engineering at IBM etc but I

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,700
do want to share with you that in your

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,380
case as you face your career you will

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,230
have probably more than

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,060
to careers such as I've had and that

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:20,640
whatever careers follow it's very hard

00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,410
to predict what they'll build upon so

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,010
what you do anything from sitting here

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:28,320
today to anything else that happens by

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,210
chance or by short-term may well turn

00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,750
out to be a turning point that later on

00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,950
in your life becomes an important

00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,630
tipping point that will turn you into a

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,810
new direction or enable you to go into a

00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:43,890
new direction so now the time I've been

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:47,100
here in Seneca as teaching I've always

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:49,140
always always wanted to increase and

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,240
enhance the role of Technology and

00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,570
teaching and learning partly because

00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,640
certainly an IBM i saw that technology

00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:59,160
was the nature was the driver of the

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,270
business of IBM and of the industry as a

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:05,880
whole and yet I felt that it's take up

00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:08,930
or it's in penetration into the

00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:12,720
education world has been very slow

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,520
relative to that of business in fact the

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,370
analogy I make it's much like an

00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,530
education the challenge facing us about

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,960
how to incorporate technology into our

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:25,140
teaching and learning is about the same

00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:28,050
has faced the tech the medical and

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,750
health insurance a health world a decade

00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,250
ago or so when they were trying to when

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,770
especially government and others were

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,380
trying to incorporate their use of

00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,760
computers into hospitals etc etc and now

00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,200
they're slowly making that not as

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,360
quickly perhaps as many people would

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,459
like but you know now that if you go

00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,000
into your doctor or hospital there's

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,950
those high-tech zones whereas in

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,959
education we've just made the beginning

00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,080
right we're using language learning

00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,370
management systems we're using

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,400
technology in that way but we haven't

00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:04,350
transformed the way we work and Curt and

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:07,350
learn so i created this and i titled

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:09,600
this open system and big data because i

00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,910
really want to talk about the

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,310
information that we do generate as we

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,770
use learning like blackboard learning

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,410
management systems that information

00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:21,239
which stores essentially what you have

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,729
done or what i have done is a professor

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,800
day-to-day hour to hour and yet it's

00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:26,590
data that essentially now gets flushed

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,230
every

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:32,020
year or so it's not used in any

00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,250
significant way you use it because in

00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,410
teaching and learning you know the

00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,030
documents that are presented grades that

00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,150
are presented as a communication

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,010
platform come to you I use it because it

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,350
allows me to disseminate information

00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:47,380
than that way to you for your teaching

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,889
for your learning but the question is

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,360
how do we make sure that big data

00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:56,169
becomes available the benefits a big

00:04:52,360 --> 00:05:00,970
data become available to us and to the

00:04:56,169 --> 00:05:03,190
other wider society as a whole let me

00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:06,580
just make this full screen here and we

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:08,139
go so there are a number of partners or

00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,910
people involved in it obviously what I

00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:13,570
call the builders the people that create

00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,900
this big data they are users as well

00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,889
like you and I there are also

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,320
administrators and others that need that

00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:22,120
data or can use that data there's a lot

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,100
of people around that are essentially

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,740
owning that data in the sense that they

00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:30,970
created the data that they store the

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:33,220
data that they use the data influence it

00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,229
so they all have different views from an

00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,880
ownership point of view and then finally

00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:39,729
there's the Free Riders the few folks

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,500
that the bad guys or people that just

00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:43,479
want to use that data in some way that

00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,080
suits their purposes maybe without and

00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:49,270
with a negative against others so big

00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,849
quick question index my definition big

00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,590
data is just basically that huge amount

00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:57,490
of usually transactional data that's

00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:59,710
going it stored digitally and in some

00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:03,250
kind of computer system up on the cloud

00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:05,860
more and more distributed it obviously

00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:09,820
is data that spans time over a period of

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:12,700
time accumulating and place and it has

00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:14,560
certain qualities it's digital it's

00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,389
there permanently in the sense that if

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,220
once it's stored it's available and can

00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:21,160
be disseminated but it's variable

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:23,470
quality it may be incomplete that some

00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,750
parts of it or got holes in it and it

00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:29,139
may be noisy may have erratic errata

00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,610
within it so the the analytics tool

00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:33,330
which is what I'm really interested in

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,560
is how do we extract value from this

00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,409
there was a phrase a few years ago

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,389
called data mining which was

00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:41,550
more about how to get data out of

00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:43,529
structured data the transactions that

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,589
are incorporated when you go shopping at

00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:49,309
your supermarket etc how to find the

00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:52,819
patterns that would enable the

00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:55,349
supermarket to make their products most

00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:57,539
valuable and available to you so that

00:06:55,349 --> 00:07:02,099
kind of data mining to find what would

00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:04,469
we effectively more are useful marketing

00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:06,209
information but in general what we're

00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:09,119
trying to do is find out the patterns

00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:12,029
that people have exhibited in that use

00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:16,079
of the big as they're creating that big

00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:20,249
data those patterns could be of use to

00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:21,419
the organizations that are providing

00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:24,300
that service whatever it might be

00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:25,709
education in our case or I hope and what

00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,839
I want to talk about is how can we make

00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:29,610
that analytic information available to

00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:33,149
the people who are part of the system

00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:35,009
and make it beneficial to them an

00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:37,229
example is in blackboard blackboard

00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:42,119
today we create about 2 terabytes of

00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:45,919
data in blackboard because we store

00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:48,329
20,000 students data every semester and

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,919
probably every student in this room

00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:53,099
certainly at least one or two

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,800
transactions per day on blackboard may

00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:57,929
be many more and that accumulates so how

00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,929
do we make that available to me as a

00:07:57,929 --> 00:08:02,789
professor to improve my teaching to you

00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:04,110
as students to improve your learning and

00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:08,729
of course to others to improve

00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:11,279
administration etc so the objective is

00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:13,469
to find the protocols policies and

00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:18,509
standards that will allow us to both

00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:20,309
look at that data and analyze it and be

00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:23,279
able to make it available now to do that

00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:25,169
we have to make sure that we don't let

00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,989
it leak don't let it get out to the

00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:29,219
parts where it shouldn't be and we went

00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:31,229
to make sure that it doesn't impact

00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:34,050
negatively or otherwise either

00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:35,339
individuals or enterprises and I'm going

00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:37,229
to tell some stories as we go along

00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:42,059
because there's been lots of cases where

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:44,579
big data that was misused if you like or

00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:46,889
escaped in some way beyond what the

00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:48,779
people who created it either wanted or

00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:51,149
dreamed could possibly happen

00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:52,889
we're going to be in a joke you know

00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:55,199
this whole question of how to use it is

00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:57,959
both a challenge about how to find these

00:08:55,199 --> 00:09:00,269
patterns and at the same time the right

00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:02,550
balance about not letting that data get

00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:03,839
misused so we're not going to be able to

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,720
have a silver bullet we're not going to

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,240
find a single way to have that future

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,269
goal we're going to have to involve it's

00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,860
going to be an evolutionary one of

00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:15,930
trying things and then learning from

00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,790
either mistakes or the opportunities

00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,339
that occur when we try something new or

00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,589
innovative in that area and i'll talk

00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,809
about a proposal i'm trying to make here

00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:29,220
in Seneca to do just that in teaching

00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:31,399
and learning just go back to basics for

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,079
a minute here we can talk about

00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,899
information data bits at the level of

00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:39,449
the lowest level just numbers objects

00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:41,550
learning a data objects like images etc

00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:45,240
all of that is information that

00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:47,999
basically occurs it's facts about the

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,009
world data bits and basically that's

00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:51,600
what we think of as the lowest level or

00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:55,019
should think of as the lowest level of

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,149
data the next level and I've laid it in

00:09:55,019 --> 00:10:00,209
layers because basically you extract

00:09:57,149 --> 00:10:01,829
meaning information from that where you

00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:03,680
include not just the data but the

00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:06,240
context where did this data come from

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,600
what was the circumstances under which

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,009
it was created etc what is the time some

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,500
of the data structured you know

00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:16,500
classically the SQL the structured data

00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,389
relational database structure of numbers

00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:23,370
particularly they'll now being extended

00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:25,410
to through XML to text the information

00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,089
is also transferable that is when you

00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,279
have that information you can then

00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:32,100
packaged it up it's in human terms that

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,079
you can transfer it to others and it's

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,050
reproducible that is you can essentially

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:39,509
go back to find the audit trail of how

00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,160
it was created and how it was extract it

00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:44,939
or you should be able to in principle be

00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:48,269
able to do that all of this is that liar

00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:50,399
higher goal the third level goal is what

00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:52,519
I call human knowledge even ultimately

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,589
maybe something I might call wisdom

00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:57,809
where basically you have models that

00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:58,350
allow you to look at this huge volume of

00:10:57,809 --> 00:11:01,740
data

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:03,350
huge compressed information and say this

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,640
is a model for teaching and learning

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,940
that would be different than what we do

00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,710
today right we have a model for teaching

00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:14,280
and learning it's the same basic model

00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:18,140
as Socrates had 2,000 years ago sage on

00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:21,240
stage talking raising questions

00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:24,180
interacting with people and conveying

00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,730
from them from me from Socrates to the

00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,880
audience as a whole some level of

00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:31,440
insight into the world but that's pro as

00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,940
some of the other speakers many of the

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,530
other speakers have said that's not the

00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,850
only model nobody learned to ride a

00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:42,390
bicycle by listening to Socrates right

00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:44,220
my grandson three months old is learning

00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,720
a life he's not quite learning language

00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,730
but in the next three months he will

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,890
start to learn a language not because

00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:53,430
anybody's teaching him his mother talks

00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:55,830
to him in a mother talk Oh baby actually

00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:58,170
it's in French so it's even better but

00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:59,400
his brain is going to incorporate that

00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,040
and he's going to learn a language

00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,620
without any kind of teaching and that in

00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,930
the traditional sense so how do we get

00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,590
from Big Data two models what I call

00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:13,260
actionable data in other words

00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:15,810
information that flows up that we can

00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:18,860
take action on that we can use in some

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:21,390
practical sense because data that's just

00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,340
informative about how the world is is

00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:25,230
not so useful as information that it's

00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:27,330
about how the data could be of the world

00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:29,880
could be and then the final one it has

00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:32,180
to be testable in the sense that if we

00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,580
have a model we should be able to

00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:37,680
extract and predict from it so the

00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:40,860
analytics the predictive analytics kind

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,760
of thing capably so there you go my

00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:46,920
three levels in the area of analytics

00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,980
this is more a model and I've got this

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:52,610
from one of my colleagues here in Seneca

00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:55,080
where he essentially created this

00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,850
standard reports going back from the

00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:01,470
very very beginning I need a pointer

00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:04,260
here no I don't have it okay well I just

00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:08,490
talked to her here at the lower level in

00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:11,280
the old days 1970s right computers

00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,060
produced payroll reports and somebody

00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,000
some payroll

00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:18,180
manager would read through that report

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,680
essentially making a information the

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,610
companies now that the employees have

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:26,070
been paid and how often etc etc all the

00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,050
taxes are paid all that kind of thing if

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:30,000
there was a question Johnny quit on

00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:32,520
Friday but we seem to stop pay rolling

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,920
on only the next Monday what happened

00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,290
there it's kind of query problems so

00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,180
these are the sort of classical usually

00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,700
paper-based type of queries usually

00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:45,030
structural or a SQL relational database

00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:47,190
type of information decision assists but

00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,780
they did help managers in business and

00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:52,200
other areas make decisions that would

00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:54,600
improve their daily operation if there

00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,580
was alerts such as something has gone

00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,560
wrong or out of the ordinary the budget

00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,390
is ten percent above plan and therefore

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,760
there's a report that gets generated

00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:05,340
saying you need to take attention here

00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,230
that sort of thing but then as the color

00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,330
indicates we've got into what we would

00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:12,780
call now more predictive analytics we're

00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:14,430
not only can you have a information but

00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,620
that information can essentially

00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:19,140
indicate a future problem or a further

00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,440
opportunity some area where you can do

00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:24,240
something beggar better faster cheaper

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,460
perhaps in a lot of cases what will

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,790
happen next and then ultimately

00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:32,070
ultimately to control that so in the

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:34,530
case of teaching and learning every day

00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:36,630
I face classrooms teaching and I do

00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:40,200
things I say things I show things are

00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:42,960
two examples to work on etc I have no

00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,850
idea how effective those are relative to

00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,040
all the other opportunities that I might

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,170
use to present should I show a video

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,110
should I let students work on their own

00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,370
should I let students work together I

00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,380
mean these are all different ways of

00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:58,680
learning and I don't today have much of

00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:00,690
an idea about how to compare or measure

00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:04,350
that in any way in terms of learning

00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:05,850
effectiveness nor do you like students

00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,260
don't really know at the moment to

00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,210
moment how well they're learning and

00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,520
they certainly don't know how well they

00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:13,470
could learn if they knew advantage of

00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,480
certain different ways of learning

00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:17,850
interacting with the information etc etc

00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,040
so there is going to be a transformation

00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,010
in the pedagogy the way that we teach

00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,870
and learn

00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:25,690
I don't think we're ready for it yet

00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:27,400
we're still busy bolting on learning

00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,710
management systems to the existing

00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,230
system because I'm doing here right now

00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:34,630
right I'm talking to just like Socrates

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:36,580
did but later on as we get more and more

00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:38,350
insight as to what actually happened in

00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:42,220
the learning we can start to think about

00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:44,530
and transform that so who creates the

00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,790
data first question you need to always

00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:48,190
look at these things from a

00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:51,010
responsibility who's responsible who did

00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:56,710
the work and who owns it and who is if

00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:59,050
you like liable or secure who needs to

00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:00,840
worry about the security so creating and

00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:03,190
processing and using the data and

00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,140
managing and aggregating the data

00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:07,780
because a lot of cases this data by

00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:09,580
itself is not as useful as when it's

00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,250
combined with larger and larger data

00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:14,560
sets so for example teaching and

00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:17,080
learning you know blackboard data is

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,670
useful but I also need to know or at

00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,930
least we should be able to know what

00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,720
about the students who go to the

00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:27,040
tutoring center all right or what about

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:29,290
the use of outside library resources for

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,970
example those are information items that

00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:33,400
might give a better understanding of

00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:38,230
that individual and that groups learning

00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:40,090
methods so aggregation like that it's

00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,130
also a problem in the sense that when

00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:44,290
you talk about aggregating terabytes of

00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:46,390
data that's not a simple computational

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:48,310
problem it takes resources and it takes

00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:50,890
special tools which we'll talk about a

00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:52,420
little bit later for the analytics the

00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:54,310
understanding about the opportunities

00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,930
and threats the threats part is are

00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,870
there free riders people that are going

00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:01,420
to make use of that now free writers

00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:03,130
aren't people who are necessarily bad

00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,350
people they couldn't just be people that

00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:07,660
take advantage of an opportunity to do

00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:10,360
something that suits them but at the

00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:12,670
results it doesn't benefit anybody else

00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:15,850
or may even cost if you like the larger

00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:17,350
group and then last thing is what the

00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:19,510
question of liabilities unintended

00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:22,390
consequences this idea of unintended

00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:24,220
consequences by the way it's not just

00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,320
that people don't think about these

00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:29,520
outcomes are these negative outcomes

00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:32,170
it's also that these are unsent

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,450
unpredictable consequences that can

00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:36,669
probably only be found out by

00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:39,700
running the experiments doing the work I

00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:41,320
mean I come from the the hardcore

00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:44,289
engineering world where I know when you

00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,639
design a new system of any sort that

00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:47,769
there's going to be unintended

00:17:45,639 --> 00:17:50,289
consequences a few of them will be good

00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:52,179
consequences Oh people can do this with

00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:53,889
that system I hadn't thought of that or

00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:57,370
hadn't designed it that can also be

00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:59,080
negatives I mean well there are stories

00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:00,659
from IBM days where customers use

00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,940
products from IBM in ways that

00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:07,510
absolutely astonished us you know just I

00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:12,340
mean in some cases in some cases in very

00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:15,429
positive ways this is Vincent surf okay

00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:17,950
who is the father in fact he's called

00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:21,340
this the father of the internet the seer

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:25,230
of the internet tcp/ip architect because

00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:28,769
in 1973 as a graduate student in

00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:31,299
California he essentially designed

00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:33,519
tcp/ip and he did so in about three

00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:35,860
months or six for something like that

00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:40,029
less than half a year and then spent ten

00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:42,490
years essentially using it to build code

00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:44,139
that would allow ultimately three

00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,940
computers two or three or four computers

00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:48,899
to talk to each other across the world

00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:53,230
and then in 1983 as his site says

00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:55,750
basically 1989 it became the internet

00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:57,850
were the network connecting other

00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,970
networks that's what internet means

00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:03,220
right tcp/ip was really initially

00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:10,840
developed as a net of networks let me

00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:14,309
just bring up this podcast see what I'll

00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:17,730
do is I'll bring it up directly here I

00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:17,730
can find it

00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:25,060
oh sorry 11

00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:38,929
I knew this was going to happen

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,710
so this was an interview in Montreal at

00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:54,080
CBC held with him and that he basically

00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:56,960
talked about the future of the history

00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:02,650
of the internet he now works for google

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,650
he has an incredible title he's the

00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,300
future of the world or something that I

00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:11,200
defect Evangelos Evangelos to the

00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:13,400
internet so very interesting phrase

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,710
given some of our previous speakers

00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:19,360
there's room for this kind of rhetoric

00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:19,360
in the world as well

00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:34,580
jump into above us we were quite all the

00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:36,770
way around the world the first turning

00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:40,820
system are you were at least in europe

00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:44,780
and the us a little bit of parties for

00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:47,150
since that time 30 years later as it's

00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:50,150
exciting located very deeply in many

00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:55,460
parts of the world we wouldn't yes or

00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:58,100
anything I was a huge yes that I still

00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:00,620
have break off to this my idol in Google

00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:03,200
which I didn't actually ask for when I

00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,700
jump me company ten years ago they said

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,690
what title you are I said how about

00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,520
Archduke very American Sergei said well

00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:13,429
we know previous artists our soup was

00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:21,610
program and he was assassinated in 1914

00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:24,919
started World War II so I've always been

00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:27,530
optimistic about the use of this

00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:29,210
technology is a proposal I'm also quite

00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:34,690
realistic of course if this is an

00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:34,690
infrastructure what all can t

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:45,289
okay well as well Edward will listen to

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:48,139
me remember being in Moscow and was

00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:50,090
asked public lectures equal legal God

00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:52,220
and everything he tells a pretty

00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:54,139
personal question to ask and I thought

00:21:52,220 --> 00:22:16,159
okay I have the answer to that I'm deke

00:21:54,139 --> 00:22:19,909
Orthodox well explain a little more

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:22,759
impossible what is most important that

00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:27,320
can use that it offers this widespread

00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:29,299
platform which is openly accessible it

00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,999
supports what we sometimes call

00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:34,059
permission elimination because you can

00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:36,360
get a connection to the internet

00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:42,750
generous people

00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:44,910
product or service up the bar and this

00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:49,500
notion of permissions of Rachel just led

00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:59,520
to remarkable corporate development of

00:22:49,500 --> 00:23:04,470
course the same society and drive across

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:07,679
the country on Facebook another horrible

00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:09,570
story this system is settled all the

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,200
details and technical information is

00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:16,620
freely available every page or how to be

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,870
connected you never do systems to run an

00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,000
application on look at all the acts out

00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:24,000
of a lot another variable to retirement

00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
so this openness and freedom of access

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,840
to create additional shares are looking

00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,010
into getting from our point of view is a

00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:40,679
stunning opportunity for our

00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:43,140
civilization somewhere around eighty

00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:47,600
eight and five years after five years of

00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:50,010
operations I walked into the exhibit

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,600
exhibition shows showing all this

00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:53,600
equipment their operating

00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:03,140
seventies and I saw these huge display

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:06,200
two-story display based on cisco systems

00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:09,440
be enabled and I remember turning to the

00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,419
men president of freak are Arab enemy

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,250
master derek published through those

00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:18,710
displays proxima he said million dollars

00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:21,409
a quarter million dollars exactly a

00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:25,840
significant sum and I would just stopped

00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:25,840
in a tracfone god so many Kaiser

00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:11,850
let me ask you did you decide my course

00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:14,909
is happening exactly as we find it so

00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:16,679
just catch that last key point there

00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:22,169
that he was making then you know he made

00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:24,149
a decision to let tcp/ip protocol

00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:27,450
essentially be commercially available

00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:29,519
and so stacks were built by IBM and many

00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:31,590
other companies very very quickly

00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:34,639
because he realized that was probably

00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:37,289
the only way that it would become global

00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:39,779
does especially being a network of

00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:41,519
networks so you know I know this is an

00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:44,220
open source and there's huge debates

00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:46,499
about how to commercialize or otherwise

00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,749
but this is a strategy that at some

00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:50,700
point you can make that decision because

00:25:48,749 --> 00:25:54,629
you can get tremendously courage when

00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:57,749
you tie into the industrial and connect

00:25:54,629 --> 00:26:00,210
an economy so let me now continue on

00:25:57,749 --> 00:26:03,769
here I have one more sort of historical

00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:05,789
one but first let me just keep on here

00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:12,269
he's been kind of hero partly because

00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:15,119
you know it's got a great beard well ok

00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:17,429
let me just run through some of the ok

00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:20,429
the thesis here is that like any new

00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:24,210
emerging technology big data and the

00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:27,330
analytics that go with it arouse a

00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:30,769
certain amount of imagination and

00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:33,509
creativity especially amongst geeks and

00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:34,799
some people otherwise who can see that

00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:37,049
how they'll make money out of big data

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:40,440
but for every one of those there's tours

00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:43,350
especially in the media that are looking

00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:47,059
for the stories about things that went

00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:50,639
wrong you know bad sounds in the night

00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:54,960
things that went bad so government is

00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:56,999
one of them government is dominant some

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,769
a huge user of big data and a huge

00:26:56,999 --> 00:27:00,239
creator big data I mean obviously they

00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:02,820
have as much information about you

00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:07,769
through your taxes and everything else

00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:09,629
is probably any other part of society so

00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:12,090
the long-form census for example which

00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:14,789
was a debate point in the late in the

00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:18,059
election last two weeks ago was

00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:20,159
reinstated even though the previous

00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:22,080
government had decided that for various

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,269
reasons they wanted to they thought they

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,820
would I think they believed politically

00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:29,129
it would be wise not to have the privacy

00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,869
concerns of people who did not want to

00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:33,210
share their information with someone who

00:27:30,869 --> 00:27:36,059
knocked on the door and said I'm taking

00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:39,570
a census for iron for Canada and that

00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:42,389
decision wasn't perhaps as serious as

00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:44,009
people as certainly they know I put this

00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:45,330
note in here but analytics probably

00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:47,609
doesn't require because the reality

00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:50,789
probably is that the data that you need

00:27:47,609 --> 00:27:52,889
is equally valid whether you get ten

00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:56,609
percent of the canadian population or

00:27:52,889 --> 00:27:58,980
ninety five percent but more and more

00:27:56,609 --> 00:28:01,470
data is more and more reliability so in

00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,759
that sense this is probably the right

00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:05,759
thing more data is better than others

00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:08,369
now the liberal promised one of the key

00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:09,480
points in their platform was open data I

00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:13,139
haven't been able to find out anything

00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,759
more beyond that I think the last thing

00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:17,549
though is that you're not going to be

00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:19,379
able to pick up the phone and ask the

00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:21,210
Canadian government for information

00:28:19,379 --> 00:28:23,309
about your taxes or whatever else

00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:25,489
they're going to keep that and let that

00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:27,899
be your business they're probably be

00:28:25,489 --> 00:28:31,169
revisions or changes to the Freedom of

00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:33,389
Information a specific example close to

00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:35,340
home here is this Toronto Police debate

00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:38,340
going on right now all about carding

00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:40,590
where police can essentially stop

00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:44,759
anybody on the street and ask them some

00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:46,919
information which is currently debated

00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:49,679
as whether that's necessary the problem

00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:50,780
of course is how well do you how well do

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,700
the police in

00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:55,340
at this detail and do they do it with

00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,960
racial profiling I mean police have the

00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,600
responsibility to gather information

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,940
about society and people's actions and

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,530
behaviors and what they do with that

00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:06,380
information of course is another issue

00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:08,000
and how they get that information is as

00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,740
being politically debated so these are

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,990
the areas that we talk about where

00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:14,750
there's you know there's a general need

00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:16,400
for the information to be gathered we

00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,260
understand that but there's some

00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,970
negatives that we want to have discussed

00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:25,820
that need to be added discussed in an

00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:29,090
open forum or in a carefully what's the

00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:32,150
word democratic way i would say some

00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:35,600
stories about analytics in big data so

00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:37,820
targa target cargo of misspelled it i

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,310
think its target isn't predicted a

00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:45,590
teenage girl was pregnant before her dad

00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:47,300
did and this is an initiative story

00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:49,580
because the background while they're

00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,980
setting it up here carga basically

00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:54,320
collects data from people shopping

00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:55,790
patterns and they had run analytics

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,120
which showed that under certain

00:29:55,790 --> 00:30:05,120
circumstances women who buy of a certain

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:08,240
age who by calcium pills and like it was

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,880
large volumes of not diapers but

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,740
something like that they basically were

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,120
the most likely to be pregnant and we're

00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:17,590
going to be parents very soon and

00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:19,760
therefore targa would start to release

00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:22,820
targeted information to them that would

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,730
indicate special deals for for

00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:27,650
mothers-to-be and I guess my link has

00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:32,510
changed since I last open it so I won't

00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:35,810
bother the bottom line was that one

00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:38,030
father came in parent came into the

00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:39,770
target store local starts went to the

00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:42,170
manager said why are you sending this

00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:45,200
stuff about to my daughter about you

00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:47,600
know mother's clothes etc you know she's

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,520
18 years 17 years old or whatever and

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,770
you know this is this is you think she's

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,390
a or something dude what is this so

00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:55,970
he tore his grip off the manager the

00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:58,580
manager said hi I sorry sir I you know I

00:30:55,970 --> 00:31:01,420
don't that's okay then you know four or

00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:03,860
five days later the manager called back

00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,510
which is an interesting comment it

00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,850
kharghar would have a follow up on this

00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:10,190
kind of customer complaint and the

00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:12,200
father said oh yes he said actually I'm

00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:13,790
very sorry he said there'd been some

00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,620
things going on in my household that I

00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:19,850
didn't know about it turns out my

00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:23,630
daughter is pregnant so you know he he

00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:25,580
felt that as a father of one an audience

00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:29,120
of one they knew more about his daughter

00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:31,010
than he did which is true now the target

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,190
took this lesson to heart by the way and

00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:37,280
they refused to do very specific

00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:39,290
targeting now to mothers they mix it in

00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,570
with other things they'll put in you

00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:43,400
know two-thirds of it will be because

00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:46,280
they realize that people don't mind

00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:48,679
having they find it what they what the

00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,240
comment was at target Manny advertising

00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:51,860
manager said if people find it weird

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,070
that somebody would know hope something

00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:57,290
about me that I barely know so they just

00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:00,260
kind of soften the message and appeal to

00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:02,210
the person's needs rather than a trigger

00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:04,010
saying oh I know you're going to be a

00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:09,320
mom soon and therefore this is what you

00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:11,120
should buy from us alright it when it

00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,400
was first time out this story was more

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,020
or less treated as you know oh my gosh

00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,500
they know more about his daughter than

00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:20,030
he knows I mean that that is it

00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,860
ultimately of course marketing folks are

00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:24,799
using this information because they want

00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:27,020
to be able to sell things to you is if

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,220
they know exactly what you need they

00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,870
don't have to sell it to you they just

00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:32,000
have to say this is what you need or

00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:35,150
here it is and know that you will accept

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,160
it because you need it that that's every

00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:38,900
customer being unique essentially or

00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,240
there another way to think of it is they

00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:43,370
have branding that appeals to every

00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,320
single customer in an ideal perfect way

00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:48,350
because they've tailored their

00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:50,210
information flow to you in a way that

00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:51,919
matches to what your needs will be your

00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:54,950
wants and needs in fact probably better

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,350
than you do marketing managers have

00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:59,480
always had this problem right I know

00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:01,809
that about half of my marketing dollars

00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,490
are effective in producing revenue I

00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:06,770
just don't know which half and now they

00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:08,740
can say which half more and more or at

00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:11,570
least get closer to that approximation

00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:14,390
some example of data leaks okay the

00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:15,950
negative side of this where and let me

00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:18,590
share one with you from IBM when

00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:21,590
I was in IBM in the early 70s IBM for 13

00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:23,990
years had an antitrust suit from the US

00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:27,559
Department of Justice against it for

00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:30,260
being a monopoly in the IT world that

00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:33,950
mainframes which IBM had eighty percent

00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:37,880
of revenue were being dominant and were

00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:39,260
unfair competition so IBM with a hundred

00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:42,830
and fifty or whatever number of lawyers

00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:44,750
fought back for years and they did so by

00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:46,639
essentially filing information that

00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:48,649
showed that IBM was competing in a way

00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:50,330
that was open and competitive and the

00:33:48,649 --> 00:33:51,440
Justice Department said to prove that

00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,639
you're going to have to show us

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,559
everything that you talked about

00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:57,200
whenever you have a customer kind of

00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:59,750
contact and so IBM I remember it very

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,899
clearly even in the lab where I was far

00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:04,519
from customers we had to file pieces of

00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:06,860
paper at that point we're still a paper

00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:08,869
based organization pretty much we had to

00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:10,429
file all the information and stored if

00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:13,159
it was anything to do with customer

00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:15,649
relations that was mountains there were

00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:18,109
truckloads that were being collected at

00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:20,089
the same time IBM was using email and so

00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:23,119
there was a huge volume of email being

00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:25,190
generated and stored and IBM built a

00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,990
database that inventoried all this stuff

00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:30,800
so every time a truck rolled up to the

00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:32,720
trust department IBM had you know some

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,280
tape somewhere that rolled and indicated

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,980
every single piece of paper with

00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,750
whatever was there so anyhow the UH

00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,929
trust suit under Reagan was dismissed

00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:43,760
finally after about 13 years and as IBM

00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:45,589
was losing market share and therefore

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,020
could say listen we can't dominate it

00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:49,700
we're losing we're no sixty percent of

00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:52,550
whatever the market was so it was

00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:57,170
dismissed and I both a day after it was

00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:58,700
dismissed IBM purged all that data we

00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:03,470
just you know they've dumped it in the

00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:05,329
bit bucket and the trust Department just

00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:06,710
went crazy they said how could you do

00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:09,859
this because they knew that if they ever

00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:11,420
had a hope of reinstating this trust

00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:13,790
issue they would have to have access and

00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:16,040
information you know but I be upset this

00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:18,410
is our data this is our information and

00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:21,500
you know we've created it and made it

00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:24,000
available to you but no longer so that's

00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:26,670
an example of you know how big data can

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,800
and I put it become a strategic and

00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:31,140
tactical weapon in the in the commercial

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,610
world particular i mentioned copyright

00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,470
trademark and trade secret sees the

00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:35,870
traditional ways in which information is

00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,800
protected in the commercial world

00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:40,650
they've always been there and they've

00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:43,230
morphed into software as we've heard in

00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:45,540
various other presentations here being

00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:50,820
copyrighted and trademarked and to some

00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:52,560
extent yeah well patented I didn't put

00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:57,930
patents here as well but now that's also

00:35:52,560 --> 00:36:00,560
possible um information letters leaked

00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:04,080
out has been typically credit card lists

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,820
for example recently someone some I

00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:10,290
forgotten the name of it but some dating

00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:14,820
site had their website crack anyway know

00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:17,040
the name Ashley anyway yeah any of you

00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:23,460
had your name on that list this rager

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:25,290
had is it really I did not know that so

00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:28,140
as a result there's been a you know

00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:30,300
somebody is embarrassed nobody in this

00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:32,700
room obviously or at least not going to

00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:35,130
admit it that you know they were having

00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:38,040
a name on this dating site for whatever

00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:40,530
reason so I mean it was it was kind of a

00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,730
sort of a small information i don't i

00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:43,110
don't know if anybody says a

00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:49,670
class-action suit against them or

00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:54,390
anything like that probate isn't oh yeah

00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:57,210
yeah well yeah yeah because you know

00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:59,850
reality is big data i mean the other

00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:02,760
example that I curse them off my is the

00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:05,190
photo images that Google was taking you

00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,510
know which showed people in places where

00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,220
they shouldn't be kind of thing or

00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,840
license plates in front of houses where

00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,760
nobody else thought they should ever be

00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,740
those kinds of things you know we're an

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:18,650
embarrassment then google had to take

00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:18,650
steps to late i dont get rid of her

00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:24,380
image out kind of thing our medical data

00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:28,190
in the small in the sense that

00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:30,260
information that you know if you like

00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:32,200
it's not about individuals health that

00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:34,880
that would normally that would be highly

00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:37,640
protected but information that just

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:44,079
indicates that certain areas have a high

00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:46,400
rate of i don't--all infections of

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,900
sexual infections for example i mean

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,910
these kinds of things you know certain

00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:52,010
popular that kind of information would

00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:54,440
come out of any kind of big data

00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:56,359
analysis and then the last one the big

00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,210
one Edward Snowden right and blew the

00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:01,520
whistle by leaking thousands of pages

00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:04,930
and millions perhaps millions of bytes

00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:08,390
of information about the CIA including

00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:10,880
telephone messages of Angela Merkel

00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:13,849
Merkel age German another Chancellor

00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:17,390
other senior members who were being

00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:19,430
spied upon by phone and maybe the last

00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:21,020
one Hillary Clinton has an email server

00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:23,300
that she's been using which she thought

00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:25,310
was because it's her own under her desk

00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:27,560
kind of thing apparently literally

00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:29,300
almost but you know that that was

00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,640
something that was her information that

00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,770
she didn't want to have part of the the

00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:36,859
government press pari and yet there's

00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:39,140
been a criticism that that's both risky

00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:41,000
and perhaps inappropriate she's a public

00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,770
person so everything she does should be

00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,400
public or should be available in the

00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:48,380
future so we have these debates okay

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,109
where people they made the media the

00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:52,700
media has great joy because this allows

00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:56,180
them to print a lot of pages and

00:38:52,700 --> 00:39:00,560
distribute a lot of debate points Tim

00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:03,920
berners-lee one more video this one

00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:09,079
actually is a video and I've got it

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:10,570
already open here somewhere yeah so Tim

00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:21,700
berners-lee

00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:30,790
starting is the father of www to give

00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:33,460
you a little later led basis whatever it

00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:37,150
is by other people to the wonderful

00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:39,460
things in ways they never imagined so

00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:42,150
today I'm factor to show you a few

00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:49,030
things the shakers in fact there is an

00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:52,120
open data movement afoot now the high

00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:53,740
for days now I made people that any

00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:58,030
other foreign reserve around the world

00:39:53,740 --> 00:40:00,490
so the sir the wrong video classic story

00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:02,920
first one resort people guitar worse

00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:06,490
plant in March last tank detective not

00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:08,410
dead poor Prague you make up the clock

00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:12,280
the artists possible dates are here this

00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:15,940
is about bicycle accidents to today it

00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:18,700
took time spotlight make a map a magical

00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:20,950
that we call these expect rocks laptop

00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,210
user interface allows me to go in there

00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:25,000
and I would imply that wedding or

00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:27,670
bicycle routes work worth checking this

00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,800
morning tactics have a game IDK

00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:32,650
government and because I clean up using

00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,720
the link data standards then use it to

00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:36,339
just make them a truck like this

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,869
neighbor take things

00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:40,989
let's get back in two thousand eight

00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:44,049
books Janesville Ohio here's Matt royal

00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:46,719
aide was involved about tea with how to

00:40:44,049 --> 00:40:48,999
leverage hammers have been connected to

00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:52,599
the water and he brought other data

00:40:48,999 --> 00:40:56,049
sources information to know which how

00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:58,059
this marked me by my wife well there was

00:40:56,049 --> 00:41:00,339
too much of a correlation in fact

00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:01,779
between without a fight I might people

00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:04,359
advertising boards of the judge

00:41:01,779 --> 00:41:06,999
resolving for estee lauder requested to

00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:09,249
attend point nine million dollars plus

00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:12,759
apparently one piece of data numbers

00:41:09,249 --> 00:41:15,039
they puttin it together and showing the

00:41:12,759 --> 00:41:17,319
result there's a person if you came out

00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:19,989
if you came up the data cricket an end

00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:22,059
in sight when my condo allows it would

00:41:19,989 --> 00:41:24,969
go there borrow down bar down by

00:41:22,059 --> 00:41:27,339
particular type of spending or from go

00:41:24,969 --> 00:41:29,410
through positive bridges and compare

00:41:27,339 --> 00:41:31,180
them so that's happening than you think

00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:33,430
we do you think of the data yes

00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:35,999
certainly can do it over here here's a

00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:38,920
sight that country spending in

00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:41,950
California have taken after example of

00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,749
Beach California you don't have money in

00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:46,660
spending on different things

00:41:43,749 --> 00:41:49,269
self-identity in fact this is a graph of

00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:52,539
the number of data sets into a positive

00:41:49,269 --> 00:41:55,059
estate broker and digital clock ok I'd

00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:58,119
like to see the great competition butane

00:41:55,059 --> 00:42:00,729
bloom the US can read how to use system

00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:03,069
well praise on with you have also there

00:42:00,729 --> 00:42:05,739
are places you can take it from our

00:42:03,069 --> 00:42:07,839
scope which is I could say plus for the

00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:09,420
specific your palate you can make pick

00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,670
up pick up people

00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:15,119
but very very specific things about last

00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:18,210
box of things specifically in EU larger

00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,740
scale this is a matchup of the date

00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:21,780
which was released about a fair

00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:24,750
elections it's now detective own

00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:27,540
criteria or any more to look at the red

00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:29,790
circles are polling stations selected by

00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:31,650
your criteria and you can say also other

00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:34,680
things on the map see what other factors

00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:36,450
like correct level so back with

00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:39,720
government data I also put back to news

00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:41,549
dinner this is the one gene APIs is open

00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,579
to be back Terrace later I actually

00:42:41,549 --> 00:42:47,250
close on that one at the hotel last year

00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:49,559
I was not the only person mr. funders

00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:52,500
that can track on this visualization

00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:54,960
forget about 90 or world shows an eighth

00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:57,270
two thousand design me to be able to

00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,400
street map that's not a big world during

00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:01,490
the same year every fact is that

00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,630
something somewhere who here we focus

00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:07,079
capitalizing it would be better if you

00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:09,180
see Europe is plays without this some

00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:12,059
places have no not that they should be

00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:15,059
here focusing update on Haiti the battle

00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:17,190
for the transit in fall 2009 was not all

00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:19,890
a cookie not as good as a lot of

00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:23,690
California fortunately just up the

00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:27,290
earthquake GOI program be released

00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:27,290
cemetery real nice

00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:33,740
this is January time lapse equal editing

00:43:31,339 --> 00:43:36,829
like there are clear creek each

00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:39,950
completed people world masters who want

00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:42,020
to help anchor blue flag imagery know

00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:45,950
that quickly bill they are focusing now

00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:47,839
the blue is refugee pack to be faulty is

00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:49,790
a spotted from the air so now ETA

00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:52,520
real-time map showing where there are

00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:54,349
directly passed rapidly became the best

00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,660
not to use it you're gonna leave work

00:43:54,349 --> 00:44:01,089
and go to class witness the package here

00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:03,829
on the stomach / rescue team in Haiti

00:44:01,089 --> 00:44:06,170
first electrode on the left hand side

00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:08,420
there that Hospital practice on

00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:11,869
this is a real-time map that shows

00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:14,420
Blancos demyx buildings 50 count those

00:44:11,869 --> 00:44:16,490
things that I needed so if you mean you

00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,200
both met at all I don't want to say

00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:20,000
whether what they mean she doing whether

00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,650
you just be chatting or later now you'd

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,900
be putting a little scientific data

00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:28,450
online I just missing something thank

00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:28,450
you very much a we have only just shop

00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:36,319
only just started that's a key point I

00:44:32,329 --> 00:44:38,390
mean I mean this he's talking about

00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,730
community data and government data I

00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:43,369
mean when we talk about establishments

00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:47,690
like Seneca we haven't really just

00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:49,369
started but we should be one thing I by

00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:53,270
the way look at the labels on there this

00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:54,980
guy's is oh mkay being talked about

00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:57,950
alphabet soup pain does anybody know

00:44:54,980 --> 00:45:03,890
where a bbfb CSU's I'd like to know that

00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:05,960
when I don't know the FBC s so all right

00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:09,290
I am NOT taking away from it I mean he's

00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:13,760
an incredible person education Big Data

00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:15,800
talk about government community open

00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,960
systems if you like learning management

00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:20,119
systems as you know log data right

00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,640
mostly they log data that's in the

00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:25,520
gradebook but they also log transactions

00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:27,500
when you open a document when you log on

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,380
all that information gets time-stamped

00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:32,960
and kept and around two terabytes here

00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:35,630
at Seneca and includes obviously

00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:39,040
assessments where you put in marks etc

00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:41,070
now in the math course that I'm teaching

00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,600
which i'm using a pearson textbook

00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:46,690
pearson the textbook is first of all

00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,640
online electronic copy or a PDF copy of

00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:51,460
the textbook but more importantly all

00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:55,210
the problems if you like are also

00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:56,890
available online with pearson software

00:45:55,210 --> 00:46:00,400
that through blackboard essentially

00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:04,420
checks the answer of a student so when I

00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:07,030
teach I don't teach very much lecturing

00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:09,250
anymore basically I have a room full of

00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:11,350
students at computers and I'm pleased to

00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:13,510
report that ninety percent of them

00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:18,520
ninety-five percent of them are busy

00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:21,520
learning with solving math problems as

00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:23,170
opposed to a lecture room where maybe

00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,850
half of them are there and the other

00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:27,910
half are listening and the other half

00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:30,880
are not that sort of thing so the just

00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:33,430
observational II the learning rate is at

00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,870
least an order maybe twice to five times

00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:37,750
higher than it would be in a class

00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:39,970
accentuation aside from which math as

00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:42,040
you all know is like bicycle riding you

00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:46,030
learn it by doing it not by listening or

00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:47,740
watching people solve problems the

00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:48,910
transactions that I get and I'm going to

00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:50,890
show you a little later about the

00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:53,770
information that I get back is how long

00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:55,960
did students spend on each problem and

00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:57,790
they get immediate feedback they can try

00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:59,710
the problems as many times assignments

00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:02,190
they can solve it may cry's many times

00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:04,780
they want so I mean one hundred percent

00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:07,780
experience and learning positive

00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:09,820
learning here's a typical example from

00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:11,050
gradebook this is now what I more or

00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:15,340
less what I've downloaded from

00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:17,080
blackboard some period of time notice

00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:19,600
that i did a low-cost way of just

00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:22,060
stroking out the student numbers there

00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:24,160
because we need to be very careful here

00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:26,410
in seneca there are people that would

00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:28,000
yell at me if they saw this here in

00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:29,680
seneca that would yell at me from a

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,840
security point you can't show those

00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,790
numbers to anybody but i've taken away

00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:35,260
the identifying information and if you

00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:37,300
can memorize all this in the next few

00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:39,940
seconds and correlate it you could

00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:41,260
probably go back and find out who those

00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:44,650
people are at cetera but you're not

00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:46,810
going to do that Pearson has this test

00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:48,680
report which is very good but it's

00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:51,079
what's different about it is if you look

00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:53,119
see identify integers rational numbers

00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:55,540
it's not about the problems that they've

00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:58,609
been solved it's about what are called

00:47:55,540 --> 00:48:01,309
mastery points sort of small topics

00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:03,650
learning outcomes and those are how they

00:48:01,309 --> 00:48:06,589
the whole course is organized about

00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:08,210
these it's not about just solving a

00:48:06,589 --> 00:48:10,400
problem or learning and reading a

00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:13,790
chapter it's about mastering these

00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:15,440
particular mathematical capabilities is

00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:17,180
a first semester one so most of you will

00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,980
find that pretty simple identifying at

00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:21,380
the integers right everybody knows what

00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:23,089
an integer is everybody knows when our

00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:25,430
rational number is it and so there you

00:48:23,089 --> 00:48:28,099
go you'll know all that stuff right but

00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:31,190
to prove this students have to do some

00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:33,770
number of problems and get this report

00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:36,829
as a result which I can then use to very

00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:39,740
easily master show what topic areas have

00:48:36,829 --> 00:48:42,740
not been mastered this is a dashboard

00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:44,510
that Pearson also provides which I find

00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:45,890
totally useless I don't know how to read

00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:50,050
this I don't know what it means it's

00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:50,050
completely but it looks good right

00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:55,250
here's the gradebook and here's where

00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:56,900
well more importantly it shows past due

00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:59,720
and how individual students have done

00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:01,849
here's a list of from a planning point

00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:03,710
of view for lesson planning the various

00:49:01,849 --> 00:49:05,690
topics and where they came from in the

00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:08,510
textbook how many problems that were etc

00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:11,510
and each one so the point about all that

00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:13,250
was that there's not as if this these

00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:15,170
learning management systems don't

00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:17,720
produce information they do and they

00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:20,299
feed it to me and in some sense also the

00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:21,950
students but it's not optimum it's not

00:49:20,299 --> 00:49:24,410
actionable data it's not something that

00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:27,170
i can either quickly look at and use in

00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:30,109
my everyday teaching very easily at

00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:32,059
least so my proposal is an applied

00:49:30,109 --> 00:49:35,420
research project where in fact we start

00:49:32,059 --> 00:49:38,630
to develop feedback methods and feedback

00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:40,940
reports analytics that would be

00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:43,040
actionable one specific one for example

00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:48,530
in the first quiz i give in the math

00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:50,480
course i always do a reverse roll call

00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:52,790
essentially roll call and anybody who's

00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,700
not there i set an immediate email from

00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:57,710
from blackboard and i say you know

00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:59,400
you're not been in quiz today or missed

00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:01,500
today's assignment or whatever is

00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,720
something that I was when I first did it

00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,250
I thought well you know what's gonna

00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,930
happen but I had two or three students

00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:08,970
came back it's a cop so I'm sorry I

00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:11,069
didn't realize or write for god or I'll

00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:14,039
be there or I'm still in China in one

00:50:11,069 --> 00:50:16,470
case somebody said so but I realized

00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:18,270
students can now do I know that if I did

00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:20,700
this consistently would have an impact

00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:22,319
on the grade point average I don't I

00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:25,200
mean I'd have to accumulate this data

00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,819
and practice this not only me but we'd

00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,319
have to then compare it with people who

00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:30,809
didn't do that and see if we can

00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:32,549
identify but analytics could do that at

00:50:30,809 --> 00:50:35,609
the end of a year or two with thousands

00:50:32,549 --> 00:50:37,920
of people 20,000 students some of whom

00:50:35,609 --> 00:50:40,020
get emails and some of whom don't the

00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,690
analytics tools could start to correlate

00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:45,210
the outcome of grade point for example

00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:47,549
with that I believe that's what we want

00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:49,470
to prove well MOOCs we've had a lot of

00:50:47,549 --> 00:50:50,670
information about MOOCs and previously

00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:52,680
today I don't know if you're all in that

00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:55,890
presentation i found it with the EDX

00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:57,390
presentation particularly but what I

00:50:55,890 --> 00:51:00,809
found interesting in this and why bring

00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:04,980
it up here is the MOOCs the Harvard and

00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:09,170
MIT group produced a data set from their

00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:12,779
experience and this is the database 160

00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:15,089
640,000 records so that is every student

00:51:12,779 --> 00:51:19,140
that took guess in that year whenever it

00:51:15,089 --> 00:51:22,619
was took their course from MIT or EDX

00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:24,660
and they have published that but they've

00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:27,660
done so following a set of standards

00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:32,940
that meet the u.s. what they call Family

00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:35,130
Protection what's it called here

00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:38,609
somewhere Family Educational Rights and

00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:40,200
Privacy Act FERPA all right and it

00:51:38,609 --> 00:51:41,910
involved things like Deanna fication

00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:45,270
simple things like obviously took out

00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:48,420
names and any student numbers and

00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:50,700
randomize them they removed information

00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:55,260
such as for example if less than four

00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:57,000
students took any any two courses if

00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:58,559
there were four students in this course

00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,950
it took four students in that other

00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:03,839
course they there's a test statistically

00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:06,150
that allows if you look at the whole set

00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:09,000
to extract and identify those four

00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:11,760
students so they essentially remove the

00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,150
set the standard at five so any group

00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,279
with it has less than five and

00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:17,529
they looked at those for students or any

00:52:15,279 --> 00:52:19,569
other and they essentially removed them

00:52:17,529 --> 00:52:23,099
in his way I didn't understand at all I

00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:25,150
mean I haven't looked at the methodology

00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:27,670
aggregation they basically combined

00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:29,260
these in ways that our group survey now

00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:31,000
what they call blurring I don't know

00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:33,369
what that is but they've documented all

00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,650
this and in fact you can go there and we

00:52:33,369 --> 00:52:38,079
we could use those techniques and meet

00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:40,510
that standard and publish this data why

00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:42,339
would they publish this data well

00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:45,069
because they could first of all and

00:52:42,339 --> 00:52:48,220
because they want to encourage openness

00:52:45,069 --> 00:52:50,559
of the data without risking you know

00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:53,589
personal identification or misuse of the

00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:56,020
data because this MOOC is this kind of

00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:57,819
data is vulnerable in evaluating the

00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:02,410
effectiveness of MOOCs the distribution

00:52:57,819 --> 00:53:04,869
etc this I picked this one up this is

00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:07,000
this little screen shot here because it

00:53:04,869 --> 00:53:08,470
says by using this site you agree to the

00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,299
use of cookies for analytics

00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:13,119
personalized content maths so this is

00:53:10,299 --> 00:53:14,650
one way to let users know that data is

00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:18,160
being gathered about them and get them

00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:20,829
habituated to that most people when they

00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:24,309
see this they think well okay but if you

00:53:20,829 --> 00:53:25,900
ask people just in abstract is it okay

00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:28,210
if we collect information about you

00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:30,640
especially if you have students they'll

00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:33,130
say well I want to be compensated or you

00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,990
know can i maybe not I'd rather not but

00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:37,359
in fact this kind of makes it part of

00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:39,970
the normal operation because let's face

00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:42,250
it if you're an institution like this

00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:43,960
you know your information has to be

00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:46,510
collected in some sense because we need

00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:47,890
to be responsible for and we do want to

00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:49,900
make sure that you respect and

00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:53,099
understand that you know that that

00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:53,099
information is respected and protected

00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:59,470
the u.s. Canadian law is called pipita

00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:01,210
and it talks about how private sector

00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:03,970
organizations not government not

00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:06,130
institutions not Seneca or educational

00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:08,640
institutions collect use and disclose

00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:08,640
personal information

00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:16,380
well we have a separate one right they

00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:19,590
have fifa freedom of information

00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:22,230
protection okay which is a more

00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,640
pervasive and talks about how

00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:25,500
individuals have the right to access

00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:28,470
information in government or anywhere

00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:31,440
else and it's not clear to me how those

00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:34,470
two overlap which is one of the problems

00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:37,530
here because Big Data to make use of it

00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:39,390
and yet follow these rules can be quite

00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:41,220
difficult quite challenging and you and

00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:44,040
I when I looked at these rules I think

00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:47,580
now I'm not sure like when I present

00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:50,550
this am I breaking fifa or people that i

00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:54,060
don't i don't think so but i nervous

00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:57,830
sometimes i go back to my IBM days in

00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:59,940
IBM when i was there obviously we had a

00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:01,980
need to protect our corporate

00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:04,170
information so there was a structure for

00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:06,420
example there's a system of every piece

00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:08,670
of information could be classified as

00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:10,290
IBM confidential and remember i was

00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:13,040
working in development so we're working

00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:15,840
on future products that had incredible

00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:18,180
value to our competitors or to our

00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:21,630
competitor to our clients if they got

00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:23,820
out early so IBM internal confidential

00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:25,860
internal use or just IBM information

00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:27,690
that could be shared and at the end of

00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:30,080
every day we locked everything off our

00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:32,610
deaths and put in a you know put it away

00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:34,320
so that was and I didn't like it at a

00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:36,720
time I mean that was in the 70s when

00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:39,360
information you know hippies etc was you

00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:41,850
know well I had arguments with my

00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:46,230
managers partly because I always felt

00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:48,960
that the the concern that information

00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:51,390
would get out was far greater than the

00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:54,600
cost of keeping it secret because it

00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:56,700
takes time and effort to you know put

00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,170
this information and classified etc and

00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,430
I'm worried a little bit about the same

00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:01,800
thing happening in the education

00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:03,510
environment here that we're going to be

00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,940
so restricted as I've had conversations

00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:07,830
where I said we're trying to I'm trying

00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:10,230
to make this proposal and I've had a few

00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:14,370
people say well you can't say that about

00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:15,750
students what about if interative

00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:17,910
students want to have all the

00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:19,420
information that they had extracted is

00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:21,460
that something that needs to be done

00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:23,440
before they graduate could someone suit

00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:26,109
and say I want every record other than

00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:28,839
my marks perhaps to be recorded to be

00:56:26,109 --> 00:56:31,420
deleted I mean that could be a debate we

00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:33,880
might have in the future and FIFA has

00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:36,849
some information about that in fact says

00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:38,980
that students well that you have the

00:56:36,849 --> 00:56:40,859
right to see information because after

00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:43,569
all there could be errors I mean my son

00:56:40,859 --> 00:56:45,520
has had a credit card problem and he's

00:56:43,569 --> 00:56:48,000
just now climbed out from under that and

00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:50,890
kind of got a clear credit card record

00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,990
so it taken took him three years and you

00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:56,890
know he was happy to be able to do it in

00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:59,109
a sense open data final point because

00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:01,480
the goal is to get actionable insight

00:56:59,109 --> 00:57:04,150
from data sets whether it's for as

00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:07,059
berners-lee said for community purposes

00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:10,630
mapping etc but to do so without

00:57:07,059 --> 00:57:14,500
damaging individuals or society as a

00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:16,750
whole in larger groups in society so I

00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:19,390
can't you know it's impossible for me to

00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:22,150
lay out the architecture to get that

00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:23,829
goal without having it but I think needs

00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:25,660
first of all to recognize we need to

00:57:23,829 --> 00:57:28,510
have security and access control rights

00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:31,780
for any access people that can access

00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:33,190
this big data with a need to know in

00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:36,280
other words if you need to know in order

00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:38,760
to do your job or learn better then that

00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:43,089
information should be something that is

00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:45,040
is available an audit trail so if there

00:57:43,089 --> 00:57:46,630
is a leak we can learn from that by

00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,490
going back and finding out how did it

00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:51,160
happen where did it happen who did it

00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:53,950
happen from etc encryption that's a good

00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:56,410
technique that's very powerful and then

00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:58,530
the simple Adam and anonymization I hate

00:57:56,410 --> 00:58:01,390
that word because i can't pronounce it

00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:02,980
basically you know removing individual

00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:04,990
information because it's the group

00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:08,020
information in large groups it's really

00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:11,349
the source of most value in these large

00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:12,670
data just an interesting article there's

00:58:11,349 --> 00:58:14,440
an encryption i forgot to get the

00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:17,230
reference here but there's an article in

00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:21,400
spectrum and some products out now that

00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:23,290
promise encryption somehow not even the

00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:26,290
person who receives the data its

00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:28,240
encrypted until the final moment in

00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:32,230
other words if they if you could steal

00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:34,119
that person's ID and run a query that

00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:37,359
data would be useless to anybody but the

00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:39,910
person who generated it so I don't know

00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:42,100
how they do it this was a little

00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:44,560
something about security that I found

00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:46,300
useful to remember how to prove your

00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:49,000
rights from a security point of view to

00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:50,920
access information something you have

00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,520
something you know like a password

00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:56,380
something you have like a key or an

00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,390
encrypted code and a credit card and

00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:59,890
then something you are which is the most

00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:04,930
and those are more and more reliable

00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:07,030
methods of security retina pattern voice

00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:11,080
prints these are things that are

00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:12,760
available now I'm not commonly used how

00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,890
do we do this at the group level while i

00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,540
mentioned how IBM had this categories of

00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:19,150
information so you knew how to create

00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:21,310
retreat IBM confidential registered

00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:24,040
information etc and had audit trails

00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:25,840
that managed all that information and we

00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:27,790
need to start doing that as well and in

00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:30,760
Seneca right now everything gets kind of

00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:32,650
dumped into blackboard and sits there

00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:38,190
without anybody knowing what level of

00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:41,020
detail needs to be kept private and not

00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:44,470
the big hassle and I just had a debate

00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:49,750
just before this meeting with one of our

00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:53,020
IT guys because the IT the kiosks used

00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:54,820
to have a ethernet connection so you

00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:57,400
could plug in and instead of using

00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:59,680
wireless but they've crippled it they

00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:01,720
start at least in unum they crippled it

00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:04,210
and I asked of course I raised a ticket

01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:05,950
and said why because occasionally from

01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:08,080
performance reasons are just quickness

01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:10,570
up I prefer to access that and he said

01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:13,210
well because it's a security risk so I

01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:15,520
said fine how much of the security risk

01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:17,560
and how much is that worth compared to

01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:19,890
the occasional time when I need that for

01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:22,840
performance or if the wireless went down

01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:25,090
you know that's the benefit so you need

01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:29,380
to answer before you it whether

01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:31,330
or not that exposure is a greater risk

01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:34,450
than the benefit that I'm telling you

01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:36,190
about for me he said well we don't know

01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:39,310
that I said well then you shouldn't take

01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:40,930
action to change it in my opinion honey

01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:43,750
pots by the way I just threw that in for

01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:44,770
fun because there is a certain honeypot

01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:47,860
means that basically

01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:50,260
you put something out that you think's

01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:53,170
attractive to hackers or bad guys in

01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:55,060
general and then when they crack into it

01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:57,040
or try to crack into it you have a

01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:59,710
record of how much risk there is for

01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:02,290
having it there's a whole question about

01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:06,760
you know in Troutman here you can't

01:01:02,290 --> 01:01:08,260
legally for example set up a honeypot in

01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:10,000
certain circumstances because it

01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:11,440
essentially perhaps people to doing

01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,130
things that they wouldn't otherwise do

01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:17,890
and then last one independent and random

01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:19,510
audits and inspections of against the

01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:23,680
use the transactions and the data that

01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:25,960
went into the database this I just added

01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:28,480
this recently there's a huge range of

01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:31,120
products available both open Hadoop and

01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:33,820
mysql for example in repositories for

01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:36,750
data storage for and the relational

01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:40,300
database is db2 and Oracle etc

01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:45,010
analytical tools SPSS and SAS SBS is the

01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:48,670
IBM what stands for socially something

01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:52,980
rather so this is how you cannot social

01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:55,330
plugin okay do you use it by any chance

01:01:52,980 --> 01:02:01,540
that's ass is the kind of industry

01:01:55,330 --> 01:02:07,570
leader of you and then yes yes that's

01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:10,140
right yeah well SAS stands for

01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:14,110
statistical helped me here I don't

01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:16,630
society for basically it produces

01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:18,460
statistical as des r the r is an open

01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:19,630
source and there's a talk tomorrow if

01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:22,600
you want to know more about it I've used

01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:23,800
our and it's powerful but but not so

01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:27,820
easy to use and it doesn't have very

01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:30,580
good presentation where's SPS and I

01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:31,840
think ass SAS do as well because getting

01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,430
the data is one thing and then

01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:35,470
presenting it in a way that's actionable

01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:37,950
and understandable by the end users is

01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:37,950
another problem

01:02:39,109 --> 01:02:46,279
oh yeah absolutely you name it and it'll

01:02:43,489 --> 01:02:50,150
do either one of any of them doing I

01:02:46,279 --> 01:02:53,539
mean you know just statistics yes that's

01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:55,970
just statistics but we're so enormous

01:02:53,539 --> 01:02:57,640
number of statistics on the various k

01:02:55,970 --> 01:03:00,170
tests that we've mentioned for example

01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:02,450
where these are all available but how to

01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:04,670
make use of them and how to interpret

01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:06,859
them it's not an easy job I mean there's

01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:08,420
an old there's an emerging profession

01:03:06,859 --> 01:03:10,970
called data scientist so you know who

01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:15,410
use these tools or can use these tools

01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:16,970
and it's it's tough work I've taken a

01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:19,910
course on our because I would like to

01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:28,849
improve my ability to use that and then

01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:31,190
the last thing alert well you some of

01:03:28,849 --> 01:03:33,650
them can SPSS has the ability to look at

01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:35,960
and essentially run queries where it

01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:37,759
comes back and tells you the key

01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:41,029
variable here is the amount of milk and

01:03:37,759 --> 01:03:42,410
the dental visits I mean they can build

01:03:41,029 --> 01:03:44,450
that pattern if they have the data

01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:47,239
apparently they can do their kind of

01:03:44,450 --> 01:04:02,420
interpolations and correlations they may

01:03:47,239 --> 01:04:04,190
not yep yep yep yep that's that's the

01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:06,200
value to the in the commercial world

01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:08,809
yeah very much so in the business world

01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:11,989
and then learning management systems

01:04:08,809 --> 01:04:14,059
which are evolving they're both the

01:04:11,989 --> 01:04:17,299
stage which operating systems were in

01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:19,369
1970 you know the big ones and there's

01:04:17,299 --> 01:04:21,710
all kinds of open source and for small

01:04:19,369 --> 01:04:24,380
ones and specialized ones most of them

01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:26,749
still as far as i can see essentially

01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:28,400
deliver the pedagogy or are built on the

01:04:26,749 --> 01:04:29,660
assumption that learning will be done as

01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,480
it was in the classroom before

01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:37,970
technology became available that's going

01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:41,059
to change conclusions enormous knowledge

01:04:37,970 --> 01:04:43,910
and value from the big data with its

01:04:41,059 --> 01:04:45,859
education or government or whatever it's

01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:47,839
hard work I didn't talk about it but I

01:04:45,859 --> 01:04:50,020
can tell you that it's tough work to

01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:53,860
look at the data to canalize it

01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:56,200
to protect it as well all right there's

01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:58,630
hope I would say that it's three years

01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:01,150
from now five years from now this debate

01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:03,970
will this discussion would be boring

01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:06,280
because it'll be taken as granted that

01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:08,740
the data we have is being mined and

01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:12,070
analyzed and valued and used to improve

01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:13,990
and revolutionize and change the way we

01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:18,780
do things well teaching and in other

01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:22,510
areas like selling milk on Tuesday maybe

01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:25,990
there we go thank you any questions okay

01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:27,880
actually we're we're I'm now supposed to

01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:30,870
quit at five because at five to ten or

01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:33,580
so apparently but quick questions in any

01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:35,530
I'm looking by the way when I make this

01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:38,440
proposal they're looking for some coops

01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:41,560
or kind of grad students who are

01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:43,000
interested in building queries against

01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:45,340
they have against the blackboard

01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,650
database that's part of the proposal of

01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:49,090
life trying to get through if I'm I'm

01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:50,890
going to be presenting it in about two

01:05:49,090 --> 01:05:54,400
weeks if it gets funded it'll start in

01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:57,100
January so i'll be looking for as i say

01:05:54,400 --> 01:06:00,670
at that point for folks that want to get

01:05:57,100 --> 01:06:04,650
into this data scientist area all right

01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:04,650
you have my name obviously

01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:11,500
no questions okay I can see you want to

01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:11,500
