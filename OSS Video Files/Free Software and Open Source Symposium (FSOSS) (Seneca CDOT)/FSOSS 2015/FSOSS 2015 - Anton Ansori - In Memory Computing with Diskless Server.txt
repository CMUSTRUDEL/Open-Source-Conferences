we're not going to get it any better

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,850
than that

00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,500
now I

00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:24,160
the thing is like we users like you

00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:30,260
canceling is coming anything anything

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:32,870
he's going to the server so start the

00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,290
only presentation and the question that

00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,290
I

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,840
and you're speaking that I can't kill

00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,840
you

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,730
I

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,559
slow news day okay

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:21,770
he'll insist one two three but at least

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:21,770
I can hear you is it any polish horizons

00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,710
whoa

00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:56,170
well what do you mean good morning after

00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:59,410
a month it's that I g1 you hear that I

00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:02,979
think there is just a little there let's

00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:06,130
really start in my presentation sub 1

00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:08,800
anomaly computing center in the text

00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:14,380
value its business after the semester

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:18,150
programs it will be present here how to

00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:22,239
increase the removable parts of your

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:25,870
computer into the more fastest the more

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:32,380
faster speed and maybe there's sometimes

00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:33,970
the modern more after this the diseases

00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,459
will be replaced with that sometimes

00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:45,130
them something the first up enough them

00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:48,130
assess me okay this about my own self my

00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:52,540
name is Anton six or I'm so sorry you

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:57,310
can drop an email into my mineral and

00:02:52,540 --> 00:03:01,000
gem University to a society or you can

00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:03,299
add my aesthetic high molecular being

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,959
lecture on communiversity balloon

00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:10,180
recessed in multimedia arts credits

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:14,019
computation and simulations we call it

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:18,430
here Oh matrix and also have being a

00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:22,120
chair in SF Isabella 2009 and member of

00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:26,910
us communists community of Olympics

00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,910
community in Swat Valley and since 2008

00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:39,739
the makati or when will I just

00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,080
love

00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,450
quite late

00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,230
Oh

00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,870
whoo

00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,910
whoa

00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:33,300
he's establishment Alicia

00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:41,530
fired for lodgings so if our because

00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:43,919
every time the mic is disconnecting all

00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,919
the time

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:07,010
if he doesn't share is what came from be

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,580
better because it could be advanced with

00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,580
issues well

00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:37,330
well my guys might fumble light up when

00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:41,729
you start talking so soon as the server

00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,729
doesn't register you quite clear

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,720
what

00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,040
fish

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:42,200
it was okay for it

00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:42,200
is cancer which usually means

00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,900
his and such

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:53,330
but I thinking doesn't work him

00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:01,369
feel better just at the eye yeah

00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,420
yeah and then

00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,420
I

00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:33,810
please don't share your webcam Anton so

00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:42,720
the bad with ghosts or work so injured

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:51,690
okay Hot Chili hiding I'll John Kerry

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:54,110
hurry okay okay Jimmy please share your

00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,110
account

00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:02,030
each day in Hebrew you yeah we go check

00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:04,970
your webcam and that reduces I'm off the

00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:08,260
chain okay and then we can see you from

00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:26,440
background we cross the road Jane

00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:26,440
necessary oh ok ok we are here ready

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:46,560
can I be the presenter my statistical

00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:54,980
hypothesis projects in kishi you know me

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:54,980
yes everything's okay yes about

00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:11,570
okay I London you are why there's a way

00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:14,870
I can continue okay okay okay wages

00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:18,320
wages this is person doesn't stop it's

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:22,340
because here in this era although there

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:25,550
are many people computer still a lot

00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:28,280
hospital here I cannot operate well the

00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:31,610
computer sometimes in my heart

00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:35,030
experience several several panels during

00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,860
the recess till they don't do not know

00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:39,380
how to operate the digital well

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:41,510
sometimes they are some into the

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:46,030
computer using the power buttons or

00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:49,670
sometimes it's also this some

00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:58,490
electricity problems here it doesn't

00:09:49,670 --> 00:10:00,950
stable enough so in another bellowing

00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:05,510
based on my experience to building our

00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:10,520
lamps and computer labs to get maybe

00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:13,910
beachings 10 to 20 computers there's

00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:17,270
sometimes we will need smarter that mark

00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:20,540
more money because they will allege to

00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:24,100
buy computer but the maintenance

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:29,570
possible and their style will be outside

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:32,360
so to make a convener ops units of

00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:36,530
course we need a server at least one

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:40,720
server and then we need a new believer

00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:45,770
violence sometimes in between 10 to 20

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:48,890
and this good after the server and the

00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:50,910
motive of virus having a common part in

00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:54,579
this power supply

00:10:50,910 --> 00:11:01,209
processors memories of course the casing

00:10:54,579 --> 00:11:03,459
itself and this trash the second one it

00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:06,759
is a limited budget together computer

00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:11,350
websphere we can we do not have many a

00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:15,309
lot of money because anything that it's

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:19,629
not the main part of of the school are

00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:24,519
some University and because this limited

00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:27,670
budget we can remove the common to most

00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:31,029
of my heart hosting server and in the

00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:33,639
multiple files that are still the common

00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:37,089
part is power supply undergo processor

00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:41,829
morning Jesse at this drive so done with

00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:45,480
the only one that we can exactly is this

00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:45,480
one the lettuce 100 history

00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:18,889
as you are

00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,889
our

00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,870
we can see this fine

00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,310
Oh

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:11,940
I think it's just discounts these

00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:15,140
distances is head of a doubt I nobody

00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,140
can hear us or not but

00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:38,120
excellent yeah did and it comes through

00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,120
like three seconds later

00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,270
unless unless it's a firewall but they

00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,790
were supposed to have torn down the

00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:50,710
particle these three runs no no so

00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:55,690
direction z brought you see our servers

00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:58,180
anymore we're both servers on probably

00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:00,150
job any there any subjects Rennie's

00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,920
anything else you think every know

00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:06,940
they're all gravity mission and joy get

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:12,840
the other folks come it could work

00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:12,840
better maybe the only thing is like

00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:29,730
yeah probably not that's right I try

00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:31,800
everything I still have to go they are

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:34,690
see our sign actually set up a lot

00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:37,620
quicker law better than they are

00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,620
flesh screaming

00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:46,160
so you for accepting speaker tourism oh

00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:49,649
yeah so he goes for a couple slides then

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,860
connections times and it takes a while

00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:57,889
you're six days ago minute protection

00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,889
racket Eisenstein is weeks for tactics

00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,240
so cheesy

00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,819
not much

00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:39,180
hey yes yeah the audio is coming through

00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:41,940
you can start from the topic 3 please 23

00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:47,160
region and the last topic topic

00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:50,010
Frankie's everything yes the beginning

00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,790
of this a shot on the beginning

00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,790
yesterday

00:17:53,799 --> 00:18:03,519
but which number right from the

00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:06,820
beginning or free on the beginning or

00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:12,039
three present here right Chuck okay okay

00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:16,950
perfect ah let's use them again to

00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:21,309
transfer it speed between these devices

00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:25,749
the hard drive also today's how tragic

00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:28,929
of all areas of G stinking 15,000 0 and

00:18:25,749 --> 00:18:30,519
we had 15,000 RPM but it's still the

00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:34,379
slower teach ourselves maybe the

00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:38,830
supposed assess if we are comparing to

00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:42,309
this one and SSD is the first out there

00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:45,549
are dressed itself and this the SSD

00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:49,720
itself it's almost in two hundred fifty

00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:53,499
gigabytes it's our knitters this this

00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:57,460
kind of capacity SSD but also in SST

00:18:53,499 --> 00:19:00,039
itself we are still pushing on the more

00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:04,809
and more the more and mark transfer

00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:09,399
skill so we can evolve into something

00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:13,989
using with the RAM itself I think now

00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:16,269
the fastest in marketplace the world it

00:19:13,989 --> 00:19:22,509
is the fastest one is the memory itself

00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:26,710
because as we now memorator it is now

00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:29,769
moving particle SSD but it's small and

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:33,820
still the fastest and I will show you

00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:36,369
how fast the memory if we are going to

00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:39,489
issue later in this presentation and

00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:42,340
then it's common also in the server

00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:46,419
intention let me mummy server between

00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:53,109
eight to sixteen that sometimes it can

00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:54,620
be 256 kilobytes maybe sometimes it's

00:19:53,109 --> 00:20:03,050
already in what

00:19:54,620 --> 00:20:06,740
memory so in Java and now is already an

00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:10,430
affordable price to buy between the hard

00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:15,200
drives SSD are the memory itself and I

00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:19,580
think to use every day every day we are

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:22,610
can we can use memory because I think

00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:28,750
there's no more we be done this at

00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:34,670
maximum maybe 16 gigabyte memory just

00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:39,860
rarely to use at maximum capacity so and

00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:43,070
and the for the forest animals it's ah

00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:49,160
it's not a dress that it's a electricity

00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:50,929
set box here it is will be loved me it

00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:56,630
will be a problem if they're absolutely

00:20:50,929 --> 00:21:00,140
there tricity suddenly lost his ambala

00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:06,200
let's talk on tap we can we suddenly

00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:08,929
pull off to London are here the

00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,780
electricity in here in the desert first

00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:15,760
sometimes gallon city itself is unstable

00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,760
in the frequency

00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:38,080
okay thought so further let's examine it

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:43,880
comes unstable it will be affect your

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:46,850
computer you can be affected your

00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:50,210
computer the personal computer your

00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:56,210
laptops are even your server itself so

00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:59,210
to minimize them a lot over there it

00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:01,580
will be clear if their city itself

00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:05,570
having a problems here it will be

00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:09,440
problems to operating system itself are

00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:11,930
the disk drive itself if it comes the

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,150
operating system it's easy we can

00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:17,720
install our we generally are just

00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:20,830
reinstalling the operating system but if

00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:29,390
it's already gone to the distillation

00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:32,900
dresser choice we must die but of course

00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:36,410
when we come to this the disk drive is a

00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:41,230
rather complicated is it's not too much

00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:44,590
maybe for our husband if it's only

00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:47,680
several parties in the district maybe

00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:51,110
just one or two parties and we are

00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:53,980
anything sometimes that maybe we are

00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:58,370
having a little soup into art again our

00:22:53,980 --> 00:23:02,090
distress but it will be a problem if we

00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:04,340
have this traffic many partition love

00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:07,550
it's not only the operating system is

00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:11,600
stuff that means in we're in the

00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:14,210
computing labs it will be easier may be

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,690
easy to maintenance if we are divided

00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:20,550
every needs of our needs in the separate

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:23,160
partition so if the district

00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:25,110
changing the problems then all the

00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:29,300
partition will become and we are

00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:29,300
starting from the another nice day

00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:39,720
so there is a trade-off between the disk

00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:43,830
drive and the memory itself the turtle

00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:46,710
is the capacity the first one is the

00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:48,480
capacity because in the capacity that

00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:51,540
this graph is now more and more

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,780
publicity but the memory is less

00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:59,000
capacity than the disk crash well there

00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:01,380
is one thing smart there's the speed

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,840
speed between the district and the

00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,210
memory the speed of the distress

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:10,080
although it's now maybe faster than

00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:14,010
before it's still plus let's faster than

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:17,250
the number itself and now maybe the

00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:19,680
memory is the fastest one will be did we

00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:27,480
had with the champions of the matter of

00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:32,070
of them before the technology here we I

00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:34,950
am going to die to test it before this

00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:39,680
the technology that we can create many

00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:43,380
computing any computer in our laps here

00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:46,530
top of university was you don't have a

00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:50,280
computer lab here we are very using

00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:54,300
laptops too many things in our labs

00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:58,790
relativity so we are will be going to

00:24:54,300 --> 00:25:02,580
try in this technology the LZ SP are

00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:05,670
some we are already commonly knowing

00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:10,230
this one the in fact I am unless we are

00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:13,140
already able to do the in article tiles

00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:14,970
and the other one is the D therapy now

00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:19,580
is specialized

00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:23,460
I am at this one these topics will be

00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:26,820
about many things about how we are able

00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,770
to improve the address itself we are

00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:32,400
very replacing the hard drive in this

00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:36,240
effort into the memory so we are trying

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:39,419
to move all of the root files it's the

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:43,080
internal drive in total memory itself

00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:46,409
server after LTS be there is will be in

00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:50,010
well we are able to move from system

00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:52,470
there will be no there will be no root

00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:55,380
filesystem into our trash because we are

00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:58,980
moving into the memory and then we will

00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:02,190
be using the memories of temporary have

00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:09,630
dragged hard drive so it will be many

00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:13,350
things that better than before for the

00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:16,830
tin foil is common interest like this

00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:19,650
one the surface of fear it will be the

00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:23,789
main processing the processing from

00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:26,580
touching crime here we lost in the team

00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:29,340
pride there is no processing over there

00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:34,080
until Kyurem all the process is running

00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:37,380
the server and it will include it the

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,409
RAM and the processor so all the

00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:44,880
processing is quickly going into the

00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:47,080
server itself the limiting is the hope

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:52,430
how powerful

00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:56,120
to do able to maintain the look of the

00:26:52,430 --> 00:27:00,460
team pilot and the other one is of

00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:04,130
course to head back in fact I on this

00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:07,370
it's very dif with teen violence and so

00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:11,300
much that there's a basic difference in

00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:14,720
fact India in fact I we we are using the

00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:17,680
server as an adult is our SAS home and

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:21,920
the roof of my system and and then

00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:25,910
delicate with the SS sss will sell

00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:28,550
secured shell and the fact I'd hear the

00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:30,160
they are using their own remember they

00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:34,790
are cpu power throughout the application

00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:37,100
so the server here it will be only used

00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:40,540
for the root filesystem the home and the

00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:44,510
filesystem the processing power it run

00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:47,360
to the first time because they are using

00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:50,180
their own ability to run into rap in

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:54,290
their rap and the cpu power of the fifth

00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:57,650
title itself to the Burton the load in

00:27:54,290 --> 00:28:00,470
the server will be slightly very very

00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:03,490
much different than the then Delta we

00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,490
are using that you climb

00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:16,929
this is the lapse in my own perspective

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:21,649
of in here we are we can maximize the

00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:25,279
ability all of the world the ability of

00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:28,190
the server of the ltsp they maximize the

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:32,090
south by itself we are we can install

00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:40,970
them on CMS computer memory into the

00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:43,220
center so the Zephyr here will be will

00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:50,390
have the maximum capacity of memory

00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:53,059
computer memory and then we can we have

00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:56,059
divided the server itself into two parts

00:28:53,059 --> 00:29:00,710
the first one is we can create multiple

00:28:56,059 --> 00:29:02,779
treat clients and the other parts can

00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:08,710
create multiple fat clients it depends

00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:13,090
on our needs are our our lids are our

00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:15,919
capacity to fill it and then forcing

00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:19,309
multiple few clients there will be no

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:24,770
hard drive because it is already run or

00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:27,649
of them in the server and then for

00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:30,409
multiple clients it's still there is no

00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:32,600
hard drive course the address itself in

00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:35,210
places into the server but the

00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:39,230
processing power is processing the Fed

00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:43,640
rivals and now we are going to head once

00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:47,840
more that the server itself will be not

00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:52,279
disturbed also there is no here there is

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:54,830
no disgrace in use well we want a

00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:56,899
service rally but for the first time it

00:29:54,830 --> 00:30:03,110
will be used in distress or sometimes

00:29:56,899 --> 00:30:08,000
some things like a dress that we can use

00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:09,990
for the first look so it must be it

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,510
doesn't know it doesn't

00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:17,490
always just how trash but we can just

00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:22,080
might be the SSD are the MMC are some

00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:24,870
things that USB Drive to look surfer the

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:31,290
file system of the self are deeply there

00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:36,390
are shadows furstenberg McMorris here in

00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:39,350
el GSP salvar la presa there's have a

00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:42,900
question to use the common equation is

00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:47,910
but only for the LSP surfer it is used

00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:53,790
for 1000 and 500 megabytes plus 30 x and

00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:56,720
x + + 200 times and thin clients but

00:30:53,790 --> 00:31:00,059
while we are until the distler server

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:03,330
that the recipes are free itself didn't

00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:05,940
have round red well well its operating

00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:09,150
so it is post with your root file system

00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:11,910
so the week the bigger your which I

00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:17,760
system here will be two will be added

00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:21,360
are better maybe in commonly in complete

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:24,270
a minimum public file system of the

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,870
desktop infirmary he knows sometimes it

00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:29,970
put me one point just little bites or

00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:35,640
sometimes it can be more than that or

00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:39,559
less than that so if we are losing 16

00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:44,250
big events memory it means we can have

00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:48,330
terrifically 450 clients are for

00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:51,809
different clients it's it is pure 16

00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:55,110
interprets the rotor system which is

00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:58,470
loaded into the memory before it is not

00:31:55,110 --> 00:32:02,820
conscious well if we are put it then it

00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:04,590
will be added after the 16 each other so

00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:07,380
if we are this

00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:10,799
and as a mother if we are going to use

00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:13,200
are we are we going to boil for

00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,500
different clients and turn the team

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,299
trials we can use this equation then

00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:26,400
this is the root file system that we

00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:29,340
have in the server plus the system that

00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:32,820
will be used for the artifact aliens and

00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:37,770
then through the x 40 of the vet

00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:42,710
violence and 300 x 24 the clients it is

00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:45,690
some up to 8.7 gigabyte was your

00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:48,149
capacity of the file system in yourself

00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:51,149
or so the because the bigger the root

00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:55,440
file system you have in your server it

00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:57,870
will be the bigger will be added here it

00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:04,230
is the variable in yer it depends on

00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:06,539
your roof rack system before so here

00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:12,210
we'll be there is a step by step to

00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:17,640
create business server we are i'm using

00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:20,340
this business after they create beings

00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:22,440
are copying the root file system while

00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:26,340
it's for the first time into the

00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:30,149
memories I'm utilizing the DMV FS

00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:32,490
temporary file system there are the

00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:36,809
first the first one is we are going to

00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:42,649
do it it's not it's not good do piaza go

00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:46,350
yes we will be many many times will be

00:33:42,649 --> 00:33:52,140
removing arson some moving moving some

00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:55,860
things over here the second one is will

00:33:52,140 --> 00:34:01,520
be we are going to modify the address

00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:04,400
step here i'm using and

00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:09,710
I'm modified to hear this is I ultra

00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:13,250
system before the uuid it is the root

00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:17,510
filesystem so I comment all and I add

00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:19,940
this line this one so there is no

00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:23,270
there's none here is an answering

00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:25,880
there's my ID and then this is the root

00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:29,990
filesystem this is your file system

00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:36,110
itself and this is the option so it will

00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:38,960
be the step by step it will be like this

00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:41,720
one so when when is to trust and put it

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,419
is will be it will be copying off the

00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:48,350
root file system in our address are an

00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:52,730
artist ran into the memory well it it is

00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:55,929
finished copying of the rotor system

00:34:52,730 --> 00:35:01,580
that we have do the memory it will be

00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:05,090
into the time TFS transistor and of the

00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:09,050
of the dependency are off what we have

00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:12,700
in ours our file system will be over

00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:19,100
there also its identity identically

00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:21,740
hobby and but the most difference in

00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:25,820
while we are using the distress it will

00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:30,080
be permanently safe but while we are

00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:36,530
using the tmpfs it will be gone when we

00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:38,650
are such artists of our system so the

00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:43,790
next part is we are going to modify the

00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:48,040
house clips from the interim FS now I'm

00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:50,630
only able to using the elite Ramesh s to

00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:54,400
modify this server

00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:57,710
gee I bffs the newest one is the Trevor

00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:03,170
Thomas you see and further on using

00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:07,400
traktor to junior to Luke also to

00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:10,880
replace the guitar as tools I didn't

00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:14,690
know how to use it but in in the easiest

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:21,259
part is using the distro that already

00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:25,130
supported from FS while we are modifying

00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:28,609
the local strip search for the follow

00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:31,609
this line which is mounting the root

00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:35,329
file system and to think of the file

00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:37,880
system pattern and then we are this is

00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:41,930
must be commented and then we are

00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:44,029
reading this one so we are creating the

00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:47,690
special on put this is will be the

00:36:44,029 --> 00:36:52,009
temporary party to temporary folders and

00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:55,789
then we r vu of like this one the

00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:59,299
identically if this one is the root the

00:36:55,789 --> 00:37:02,089
oakmont will be the place is better run

00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:05,210
butchers come back already and then we

00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:09,559
are collecting on the DMV FS at maximum

00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:13,430
size capacity a hundred percent and then

00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:17,089
we are going to copy editing copy into

00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:20,420
their own put in so this temple radio

00:37:17,089 --> 00:37:24,680
copy files for me in the mail good my

00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:26,050
mom and we are after a copy we will be

00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:29,220
underground

00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:34,150
temporary so it will be popping

00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:38,950
identically after that of course we are

00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:41,760
going to it inglaterra teammates using

00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:46,150
this comment captain interim FS

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:52,600
municipal says that's it RG that email

00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:55,720
the NGSS rampant this one is it's up to

00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:59,200
you to give it a name but I'm sorry

00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:00,970
using these particles ready we have a

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,240
second my apologies if you have 15

00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:06,340
minutes do yeah I just I just want to

00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,560
refresh or because our slide stop I just

00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:11,400
want to refresh the browser give me two

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,400
seconds okay

00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:15,990
just the don't we ever are 15 minutes

00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:19,869
left on the track oh ok so after I think

00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:23,079
after creating the ringgit energy we are

00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:29,050
going to move them what we are modified

00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:34,690
before so it is the make up into will be

00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:38,050
over at the local after that we are

00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:41,380
going to modify the growth because with

00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:46,000
there will be no option out there to

00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:48,520
look our little therapy so yeah I'm all

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,490
being idea typically this is i'm using

00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:56,070
the first time using the debian so this

00:39:51,490 --> 00:40:01,140
is for the percentage is still first but

00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:07,800
copying and then modify just only here

00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:07,800
in eternity the eng- run boot

00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:21,930
after after that I I'm having our

00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:32,329
performance test this my computer which

00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:36,450
is which is sorry is it ok sister

00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:40,499
yesterday yeah ok this is the computer

00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:43,470
the laptop that I had used for this test

00:40:40,499 --> 00:40:48,210
this is just a part of the tests and

00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:55,109
this is the specification of my computer

00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:58,740
my laptops and this is the processor

00:40:55,109 --> 00:41:01,259
intensive last for the processor that if

00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:04,339
does for the lead part it is for the

00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:09,329
this and the right part is for the

00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:11,759
immemorial so this is for the process of

00:41:09,329 --> 00:41:15,480
intensive task there is almost no

00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:18,359
difference between to toss between the

00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:23,130
this is the magic man's not small BTW

00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:26,160
and it's h.264 feature encoding almost

00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:28,289
no difference so the processor is

00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:33,720
already in full capacity and fully

00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:42,000
utilized the other one is for the gender

00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:45,690
repair it is almost the same let me see

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,600
this song it is almost identical identic

00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:57,540
for the processor intensive in

00:41:48,600 --> 00:42:02,400
transistors and this is the interesting

00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:04,500
of the discipline success while we are

00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:09,180
using the distance if test there is

00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:12,710
something that very much difference this

00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:15,840
one so the iOS test further Adam right

00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:19,410
where you see the trees it's on the f

00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:21,840
two hundred megabyte but we're using the

00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:28,500
memory it could be almost five each

00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:33,710
other for dowry this is the rate the HD

00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:40,080
part time this week it's almost agency

00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:42,480
104 107 and this is or the unpacking

00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:50,440
little come out it's almost the same

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:57,390
almost the same time DT problems

00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:57,390
is there something that's your affair

00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:08,790
well can I v2 presenter sure

00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:24,640
okay perfect and this is the test fault

00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:28,570
I ozone which is will be decibel

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:30,820
discontented really really that's if of

00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:34,150
course further in performance it's

00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:36,490
almost the same plus it is written from

00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:40,960
the job already for the jet from the

00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:46,710
Jets itself it's almost the same but in

00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:50,260
the red performance this one will be

00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:52,840
okay further this one further well we

00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:55,360
are using the tease it is almost 70

00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:59,020
megabytes but for the red performance

00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:07,020
while we are using memory it's ours 40

00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:10,140
debates and then this one as it is

00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,140
connecting again

00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,850
ok

00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:31,640
can I need the president okay for this

00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:34,460
one there is another one well well I be

00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:37,370
using this for record size one mega bag

00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:41,150
and the valises is cookie jar died the

00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:43,910
discuss our is red performance when we

00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:46,250
are using this it is only 70 big events

00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:49,400
but while we are using the memory it's

00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:56,390
almost read each other more than 50

00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:59,060
events it's also where I this one but

00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:04,400
the red performance city for phillippe

00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:07,540
for the pharmacist to teach events of

00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,540
activity problems here

00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:28,180
this is will be this is almost 70

00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:34,329
megabytes and this is more relevant

00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:37,150
debate so therefore its performance with

00:45:34,329 --> 00:45:41,230
values the memoir and using the disc

00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:45,099
itself it's very large and another one

00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:47,859
is this one this is the composition for

00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:51,490
the tests record well we are using the

00:45:47,859 --> 00:45:54,910
red performance here it is very very

00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:58,000
funny left different speeds this is some

00:45:54,910 --> 00:46:06,069
reason I was between 70 megabytes but

00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:08,619
here is in five between 5 petabytes so

00:46:06,069 --> 00:46:11,710
this is for the memorial intensive tasks

00:46:08,619 --> 00:46:17,200
it's almost no difference just a slight

00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:20,980
one because the server and mr. surfer

00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:25,079
didn't using didn't use the strap is

00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:27,640
used memory so this is the ram speed

00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:33,329
comes with the six almost walked into

00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:38,849
the 14 to the vet and for the stream

00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:43,960
it's also almost in between five fifth

00:46:38,849 --> 00:46:50,290
14 to 16 gigabytes it is the speed of

00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:52,809
the memory don't we do and then this is

00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:59,079
the the next thing that I will do in the

00:46:52,809 --> 00:47:01,230
near future I will be will be creating

00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:04,560
an automatic ways although

00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:09,450
with twitter is a CIO command-line

00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:13,020
interface or UI interface the second one

00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:16,170
will be I maybe can be working into

00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:18,750
potable distro because while i am using

00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:22,140
the first time with the debian i fail

00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:24,180
that while using the winter and the

00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:27,390
derivative of the moon to itself I

00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:30,540
didn't have I didn't have tested and I

00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:33,750
ridiculous I'm still trying to create it

00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:38,250
from the spreads after that if this

00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:39,920
second one is about create it will it

00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:43,950
should be tested on all this through

00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:48,060
including the third person it is in oven

00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:51,570
to Sierra are in fedora and then

00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:54,720
creating a web builder opensuse studio

00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:58,859
so we can create anything in fastest

00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:01,980
ways because there is no slower teachers

00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:04,890
over there as we know the speed is a

00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:07,410
very fantastic over there and maybe

00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:11,190
implement it in more many things that

00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:14,190
maybe if it possible maybe will be Pluto

00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:22,260
itself running in the server of the

00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:27,960
distress and there's a sec documentation

00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:31,560
here and I preaching in my my project in

00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:34,800
Eclipse these things and let her get

00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,730
attraction any laughs and I didn't

00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,359
already

00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:44,190
anything to the github because I'm still

00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:53,910
trying to get our script of who created

00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:57,710
the easier part of this and then thank

00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:57,710
