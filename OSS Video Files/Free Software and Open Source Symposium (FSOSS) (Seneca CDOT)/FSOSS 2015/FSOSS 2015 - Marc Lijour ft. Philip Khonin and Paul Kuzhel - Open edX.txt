I'm here to excuse us to make sure you

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:17,070

oh here's my other thing could I ask you

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,990
when you ask a question you sort of

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:31,220
shout it because then everyone here's

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,220
part of a question and the answer

00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:43,549
thank you right so good afternoon

00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,700
welcome everyone thanks for sharing this

00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:50,420
time with us today so I mark I'm a

00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:54,229
director of self a Linux in in toronto

00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:56,780
ontario and it's a celebration for us to

00:01:54,229 --> 00:02:00,200
be here for many reasons first because

00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,569
we are a free software and open source

00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,829
company at the core that's been out

00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:08,989
there for 16 years and we will of free

00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:12,140
software with big supporter of free

00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:14,269
software and we are happy to sponsor the

00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,700
conference and i want to congratulate

00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:18,739
the great work that select the seneca

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:24,349
communities do has been doing over the

00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:27,920
years so as we were saying I'm i have

00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:31,370
also a background in education I held

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:35,299
the province launched elearning in k-12

00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:39,350
and so I'm very fond of the learning

00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:40,940
management system and the sector and it

00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,739
just happened that my companies are

00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:47,750
fairly nerks is working on a project

00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:53,500
with University in Quebec to port open

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:57,680
EDX to OpenStack to do some some kind of

00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:01,209
open source magic there so I was in

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:05,599
Boston a couple of weeks ago and i was

00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:07,760
first for the first time had a chance to

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,220
mix and mingle with the open EDX

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,889
community to hear their talks and so I

00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:16,459
said why you guys should really be

00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:18,290
coming to Seneca to present open EDX

00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:20,720
because it's a it's a great thing and

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:24,650
because the silicon logo has an was on

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,919
one of their slides I thought there

00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:31,819
would be it would be more than than than

00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:34,220
a great opportunity unfortunately nobody

00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:36,739
could make it so they were good enough

00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,720
to to share a slice and I volunteer to

00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:42,469
talk a little bit about open EDX so by

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,330
no means I'm in expert in open EDX

00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:46,130
itself but I'm going to be

00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,980
to be very close to this project as it

00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:51,710
goes forward well I if you have

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:54,530
questions on LMSs and things like that I

00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:56,210
can I can answer that and if you want

00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,910
more details about the project jonathan

00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:00,500
and the team is in the refreshment area

00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,870
and jonathan is going to talk a little

00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,520
bit more about OpenStack in the next

00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:09,830
hour so if you want to attend that as

00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:13,580
well so a couple of clarifications I've

00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:17,600
been I've been corrected by the the MIT

00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:20,600
open EDX team on the description that I

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,500
submitted for the conference a couple of

00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:27,500
things first they don't they are not

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,470
comfortable with the idea of publishing

00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,870
or communicating that open EDX would be

00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,420
a replacement for a learning management

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:38,720
system like a blackboard or canvas or so

00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:41,720
forth they like to integrate to learning

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,330
management systems so that's one and and

00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:48,350
the second one I think I didn't make it

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:53,000
clear that open EDX is not an MIT

00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:55,040
project per se was EDX started at MIT

00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,160
and Harvard we're going to talk about

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,520
that and it's not an independent

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,860
organization that looks after open EDX

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,440
so this where for the record for the

00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,490
clarification so let's talk a little bit

00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:15,040
about open EDX if there is one takeaway

00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:18,530
from this project is that open EDX is

00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:21,140
adventure to go and educate a billion

00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:24,820
people so we're talking about making

00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:31,010
education accessible affordable

00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:34,310
collaborative and and of increasing

00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:38,390
quality of course the CEO of EDX Anant

00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:39,950
Agarwal I think was just promoted to to

00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:43,610
do some work at the international level

00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:48,710
I think it's the unity United Nations so

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:52,810
it's it's a certainly a games a thought

00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,810
leader and a change maker

00:05:53,290 --> 00:06:02,240
what is EDX let's start with the air x

00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:04,850
piece of open EDX so EDX is three

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:09,050
different things first of all it's a

00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:10,970
non-profit venture you can switch

00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,790
companies just people collaboration

00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,530
community people that are working on it

00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:20,630
the second thing that it is it's a

00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:24,230
website the website is edx.org and it's

00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:32,590
also a platform what you have to

00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:43,340
differentiate is EDX and open EDX EDX is

00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:48,410
comes from the the MOOC ventures so the

00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:50,810
MOOCs are massive open online courses so

00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:54,650
we we heard a lot about MOOCs back in

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:59,630
2012 if you remember New York Times said

00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:03,710
that 2012 was the year of the MOOC there

00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:09,880
was a surge in companies doing book you

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:13,490
had Udacity Coursera and EDX of course

00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:18,020
you had courses for example Sebastian

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:21,470
phone from another group launched the

00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,810
course online he had more than 150,000

00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:27,200
students in the course so when we talk

00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:30,710
about massive courses online we're

00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,990
talking about not tens of thousands but

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,300
hundreds of thousands of students may be

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:39,170
more in the single course in a single

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:44,000
term concurrently so that that's massive

00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:46,880
so how do you make that work well you

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,640
have obviously a lot of automation going

00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,070
on you have a scalable platform that

00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,050
allows people to collaborate and you

00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,210
have also a platform that makes it

00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,170
easier to put your courses online and to

00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:01,250
collaborate and we're going to talk

00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:05,480
about that the concept of MOOC though is

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:08,480
not that did not start in 2012

00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:11,900
and as Canadians we can be proud to say

00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:17,890
that the MOOC the term of MOOC has been

00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:21,250
coined in Canada in 2008 group of

00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:24,560
Canadian researchers they've call me

00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,570
George Siemens stephen downes they were

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,690
working on a course for the University

00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:33,530
of etta baska on connectivism which is a

00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:38,200
big thing for George George Simmons the

00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:41,630
whole idea is that II instead of just

00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:44,570
they are different ways of learning one

00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,940
way is I'm taking a book I'm reading a

00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,040
book maybe a memorizer book and then I

00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,380
can repeat it just the content what I

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,240
learned someone I can repeat it to a

00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,130
teacher I can maybe write something on

00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,630
the paper and the teacher professor is

00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,990
going to say well you learn the course

00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:04,970
you pass there are other ways of

00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:07,040
learning when we are born when we don't

00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,080
know how to read and we don't learn

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,420
English or French or the mother tongue

00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,760
just by reading a book we learn by

00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,310
talking to people we want by picking up

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,150
things looking at the context making

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:22,910
connections with people associating

00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:27,350
concepts patterns with emotions with

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:31,070
movements we learn making things back to

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:33,650
Ruth's keynote earlier and so the idea

00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:39,230
of making those connections and learning

00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:41,720
through connections and gives magno

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:45,920
gives open to a new theory of learning

00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:48,320
so connectivism is such theory to talk

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,740
about connectivism wisdom attic learning

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:56,080
and the idea was to launch a course

00:09:51,740 --> 00:10:00,550
online that will make it easier for

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:03,140
professors and students to connect to

00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:05,410
start to build those links and

00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:12,140
disconnections to make learning happen

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:14,390
so this came the term MOOC and and we

00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:17,329
have many types of MOOCs up there so you

00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:19,220
have people doing their own MOOCs

00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:20,809
maybe in their class maybe at seneca

00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:25,670
somebody would be using I don't know a

00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:30,379
Flipboard Twitter YouTube and kind of

00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:33,470
mix and match more things and telling

00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:35,989
students or help encouraging students to

00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:38,929
collaborate when with so that's the kind

00:10:35,989 --> 00:10:40,869
of same idea behind this so you're kind

00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:44,119
of learning from each other

00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:46,249
collaboration discussions now when you

00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:49,819
get to this stage of having a hundred

00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:52,449
thousand people in the course the next

00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:56,629
question is how do you coordinate right

00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:58,399
so other questions so how do you as a

00:10:56,629 --> 00:11:01,759
professor how do you pick up know who's

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:05,360
doing what I was doing less well who do

00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,040
we should I help first how do I assess

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,959
that many people so these are the

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,959
Technic technical questions at the core

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:20,089
so all these great universities now are

00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:21,889
doing MOOCs and it's also where for

00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:25,419
University to be part of a club to be

00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:29,179
harnessed to promote their services

00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:30,980
MOOCs have not been monetized yet really

00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:33,769
it's not it's not a huge source of

00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:37,779
revenue but it's a source of reputation

00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:40,549
and it's also a good step toward

00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:43,129
accessibility of learning so there was

00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:46,429
this story of a kid in Mongolia 15 years

00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:49,540
old and it's all open out there so just

00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:53,199
takes a computer go take a course and

00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:56,119
hands up on the top of the class and

00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:58,209
hands up winning a scholarship to one of

00:11:56,119 --> 00:12:01,009
these Ivy League engineering

00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:05,989
universities in the US so great

00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:10,040
opportunities by making learning open so

00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:12,379
what are the goals of EDX so reaching 1

00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:15,459
billion students increasing the quality

00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:21,199
of education increasing access obviously

00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:25,279
and also improving on campus education

00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:28,009
so what if we could use those tools that

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:31,550
are available for e-learning to enhance

00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:33,709
the learning that's happening in house

00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:37,279
if it truly is that good why not use it

00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:39,950
for regular classroom so that's what

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,899
people have started or campuses that

00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:45,019
started to do is probably what also

00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:51,320
Senecas was is thinking when they launch

00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:55,040
their open EDX project here the other

00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,170
piece of it is since you have all these

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,820
interactions happening online you have a

00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:03,290
lot of data you have data who's talking

00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:07,160
to who how do students perform how fast

00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:10,610
they perform but also data on the course

00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,769
content when a video is watch only three

00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:14,480
seconds and then every drop they made

00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:17,180
something wrong with the weather video

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,269
is designed to get a lot of data on

00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:22,339
what's happening in a course and you can

00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:24,649
crunch number and based on this data

00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:27,529
make this informed decisions to improve

00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:29,690
the course and to help students and and

00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:32,360
the Holy Grail is to have students on

00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:34,760
real-time yeah the faster you know how

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:41,870
things are going the faster you can you

00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:47,260
can focus your efforts now so that's the

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:49,700
the website for EDX so pretty easy okay

00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:56,870
so what's the what's the history there

00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:57,980
so started to in 2011 MIT Harvard a lot

00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:01,490
of people from the computer science

00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:04,040
department that are doing pretty good on

00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:08,120
the technical side start developing this

00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,709
platform on 2012 comes very fast it's

00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,860
the year of the MOOC everybody's out

00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:16,010
there EDX is not the group that got the

00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:22,279
most students but they're going fast and

00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:25,250
then something happens in 2013 I will

00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:28,220
come back to that later but the group

00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:33,260
there is a group inside MIT that's very

00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:38,510
Pro open source and the EDX framework is

00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:41,510
based on Python and they ended up up

00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:45,110
sourcing the the platform which already

00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:45,390
helped also moving the numbers but the

00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,900
num

00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:52,680
of MOOCs courses themselves keep going

00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:55,410
and by last month you had about 5

00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:59,480
million students taking courses on the

00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:59,480
platform just quite a significant number

00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:04,410
so these are some screenshots to see

00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,880
okay what is this EDX thing what does it

00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:08,790
look like what does the platform look

00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:12,030
like so here's your on your course you

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:14,490
can embed videos all these things that

00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:19,520
you embed like videos they're inside of

00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:23,100
blocks that can be reused and they also

00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:25,350
that you can pull from repositories like

00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:29,010
a learning object repository or another

00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:31,200
learning management system and you have

00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:34,260
the ability to connect those different

00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:38,460
systems through protocols like a GI or

00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:43,950
things like that so interactive media

00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:46,650
you have the ability to do tests

00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:49,290
questions and answers and have some

00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:53,850
hints in there you have the ability to

00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:56,880
oh that's the next one is it's a chief

00:15:53,850 --> 00:16:01,590
so it takes a lot of memory sometimes it

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:06,650
lags a little bit so we can put any kind

00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:06,650
of app in there and get the data for it

00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:16,110
you have discussion boards you have also

00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:20,280
sa types of questions where you can can

00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:21,960
write essays and long things and the

00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:25,860
weather courses are designed are pretty

00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:29,100
familiar over to you it's a course like

00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:35,100
a book called chapter say modules unit

00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:38,240
so forth and it's there is a nice little

00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:41,370
interface for professors to create

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,520
multiple choice questions just very

00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:47,850
simply just by typing the engineer which

00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:52,220
is very important you have two things on

00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:55,200
the on the system on the platform one is

00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:58,800
the learning management system for

00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:01,350
students to consume courses and interact

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,709
and the other other piece is the studio

00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:08,699
where professors are going to upload

00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:13,559
their courses designer courses combine

00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:16,980
resources so these are obviously to the

00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:19,500
two sides of the current coin so what

00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:22,860
about open EDX now so open EDX is the

00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:25,620
platform that is used to run the courses

00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:29,670
online there through the EDX program and

00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:33,059
it's been open sourced which it has

00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:36,300
where comes the word open lyrics so open

00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:40,400
EDX is a project to build a platform for

00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:43,429
a community so the tin think how do we

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,890
make how do we grow to a billion

00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:48,540
students how we make these platform more

00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:52,640
democratic and said well there is no

00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:55,890
choice we have to open source it and

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,950
they are pretty happy by the decision

00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:01,320
they make in September I was there you

00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:04,440
have huge community of companies you

00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,419
know some of these are universities that

00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:10,290
are you know fund for example French to

00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:12,590
the platform a national level and they

00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:16,290
made it their national MOOC

00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:18,690
infrastructure so you have if you if you

00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:21,179
will customers or community of users

00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:23,220
that are taking the platform and making

00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:26,120
their own but you are also companies

00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:29,280
like how of course we are there but

00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,929
cynical is there value way you have also

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,870
some companies that are there to provide

00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:36,030
the support that only that is needed to

00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:40,500
to make things work when you have a

00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:44,880
problem you can call someone so open EDX

00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:47,640
is the platform it's been open sourced

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,860
not so long ago about two years ago you

00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,809
have documentation on it you're going to

00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:55,140
give you some some links there are four

00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:58,880
arms it's good on github there is a

00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:01,050
mailing list there is a lively community

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,200
ecosystem of companies before you can

00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:06,090
call and you have books online so you

00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,880
can actually go to a library by a book

00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,740
and learn how

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,940
do your courses in their eggs so

00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:15,130
information is out there the idea to

00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:19,540
open source was actually to open sourced

00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:21,910
by the December of 2013 what made them

00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:24,820
speed up a little bit is when Stanford

00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:28,930
said well Stanford's the big University

00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:32,200
you know that so when Stanford came and

00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:35,890
said we want to use open EDX but we want

00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:38,650
it to be open source then it kind of was

00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:42,310
like the catalyzer and met things move

00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:44,830
way faster so basically they went twice

00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:51,250
as fast clean up the cold open sourced

00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:53,290
everything so the licensing so you know

00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:57,700
is it free software is this open source

00:19:53,290 --> 00:20:00,520
is it both it's kind of both the the

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:04,090
team made the decision to license the

00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:11,140
core platform as free software with a

00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:14,530
very solid free software license and a

00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:17,160
GPL so the idea is that everything

00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:20,170
that's happened in the platform

00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,780
everybody's encourage strongly to

00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:25,210
contribute back to the platform so when

00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:28,180
for example France has been developing

00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:30,490
something like a module or an extension

00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:36,360
of the code then everybody in the

00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:40,980
community benefits for for it now the

00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:42,970
the team also wanted to encourage

00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,490
third-party provider that could be a

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:47,980
publisher could be a small companies

00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:49,990
doing serious gaming they wanted to

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,660
encourage these people to contribute and

00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:54,670
to add to the value because learning

00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,980
online is not just about the platform

00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:59,320
and click things it's about the content

00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:02,590
right cup video I'm going to find there

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:05,890
what kind of courses so they wanted to

00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:09,340
make very easy to people to for people

00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:11,320
to contribute and for this reason they

00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:14,920
use a permissive license the Apache

00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:18,010
License to allow people to be a little

00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,270
more protective with the internal

00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,040
property

00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:23,260
doesn't affect what's happening in the

00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,880
core platform there are those more

00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:29,890
people to participate the way they want

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,320
and it's all pretty clear they have very

00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:34,210
nice and clear upfront licensing page so

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,100
you know what you're going for so a

00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:41,380
couple of examples so that's the the

00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:44,850
famous stand for moog page can check it

00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:47,620
out it should be up there still today

00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:51,490
you have this one is also very

00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:53,290
interesting is it Chinese from nah I'm

00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:56,650
not going to adventure myself

00:21:53,290 --> 00:22:01,120
pronouncing that name here but it's it's

00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:04,450
a very huge implementation it's very

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,280
nicely done you have this French one

00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:10,930
which is a little more familiar to me

00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:14,350
closer to home and basically anyone

00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:16,690
could contact the open EDX platform run

00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:18,910
them on only on their laptop owns some

00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,770
cloud servers and use it for anything

00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:24,640
they'd like you know if you want to do

00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:26,890
some community training if you want to

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,920
do any kind of course technical course

00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:32,260
whatever it's out there for anyone to

00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:35,560
check and to use the way they think you

00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:37,900
should be used so a lot of people

00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:43,030
actually been using this for many many

00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:47,320
many different courses now so that's

00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:49,750
where the nepalese school joke but I

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:53,500
think it makes the point so these pet

00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:54,930
pet X doesn't exist but I think it makes

00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:59,230
the point that you could use it for

00:22:54,930 --> 00:23:02,670
virtually anything your name so where is

00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:05,740
it used streets used in pretty much

00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:10,780
everywhere except Africa prefer actually

00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:13,030
the but one of the caveat there is the

00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,740
team doesn't know who is using it

00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:18,070
because they have nowhere to keep track

00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:20,350
of who downloads it and where people

00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:22,600
actually running it seriously in some

00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:26,020
some kind of big way so they're asking

00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:28,990
anyone that is using open a text to

00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:30,930
actually being them back and then them

00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,940
know what's happening but

00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:37,250
even though they have a hard time

00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:41,520
keeping track there is a pretty wide

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:44,670
implementation no use globally so

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:48,480
Chinese French and English out the top

00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:49,860
three languages and that's where there

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,890
is a lot of activity right now but

00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:54,630
obviously it's a no it's out there for

00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:58,770
people to use could be using any

00:23:54,630 --> 00:24:02,400
language you have more than one hundred

00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:05,610
fifty fifty sides right now 18 languages

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,760
and it's just started that's only two

00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:11,670
years after it's been open source so

00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:14,100
what's in there so can you raise hand if

00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:15,750
you have any technical background off

00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:19,380
your interesting and technical things

00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:22,410
with a tech person in there so much

00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:25,680
don't be shy okay great we have some

00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:30,120
tech people so what's in there well it's

00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:33,600
a it's an architecture that like like

00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,850
achieve or lack modules that found in

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:40,290
two other modules so it's pretty clean

00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:43,200
the core of it is is the X block and the

00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:45,860
X block is like a deep in HTML or an

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:50,550
iframe it's something that contains

00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:53,670
pretty much anything you'd like the X

00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:55,890
block can't connect to two dead out

00:24:53,670 --> 00:25:02,700
there can connect to services there is a

00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:06,990
dell runtime it's a python so it's it's

00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:10,470
pretty modern language it's pretty nice

00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:12,720
to do to work with there is a huge

00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:19,290
community python which makes it great I

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:22,050
think they're using jungle as well so

00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:25,430
all the kind of young folks we can use

00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:27,600
MongoDB is a MySQL or the open source

00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:32,130
technologies that you guys would be

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:35,810
familiar with and is it there is a nice

00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:40,170
way to connect your own code extend it

00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:44,690
so if you are the things that the system

00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:48,900
does now registrations profile cohorts

00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:52,980
reporting progress wiki translation

00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:55,170
theming so pretty much the core features

00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,850
that you would expect in a learning

00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:58,740
management system if you think I don't

00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,790
know what you have here other than open

00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:07,200
EDX maybe your blackboard or with you

00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:10,530
okay all right so will you okay great

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,200
great so open source is also there yeah

00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:15,920
so when you think about LMS is really

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,990
about hanging a way to store files

00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,520
contain them in courses as with the

00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:22,230
student with the teacher when they take

00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:25,890
with access to what and how do you

00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:28,710
submit your silently so pretty much the

00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:34,290
basics is already implemented in the

00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:36,330
system now I was referring to the

00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:39,990
different module or the different sides

00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:41,460
of open EDX you have the learning

00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:44,780
management system we're just talking

00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:48,660
about and you have the studio which is

00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:50,370
the tool professors use to build their

00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:53,640
courses which is very important because

00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:55,050
if it's very hard to upload a course

00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:59,510
then you're going to not going to find a

00:26:55,050 --> 00:27:05,460
lot of courses in the system oh and the

00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:07,470
most likely be very very tedious and the

00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:11,730
other third piece I didn't talk about is

00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:14,760
the analytics piece and this piece the

00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:17,160
infrastructure is is there and there's a

00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:21,150
lot of development going on there we

00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:24,000
found a lot of universities interested

00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:27,210
in building on top of that they are

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,200
doing some very interesting things like

00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:33,300
real-time updates so you can on a look

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,190
like hundreds and thousands of students

00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,200
doing things downloading things at

00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:39,780
different time you can have a dashboard

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,920
and see okay what is the top field is

00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:45,420
watch right now what you know where our

00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:49,590
students in terms of completing the

00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:52,170
assignments and it's a very hard thing

00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:54,150
to do if you look at it a bit that the

00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:57,779
technology used it's the same kind of

00:27:54,150 --> 00:28:00,419
technology you use for big data it's

00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:02,489
a lot of data you have to sort out and

00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:07,889
how do you search efficiently in there

00:28:02,489 --> 00:28:10,499
they're using a Cabana elasticsearch so

00:28:07,889 --> 00:28:12,719
a lot of great no good technology you

00:28:10,499 --> 00:28:16,099
have it there so it's an exciting

00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:19,169
project for that as well as it uses the

00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:22,769
the fanciest and the most advanced

00:28:19,169 --> 00:28:26,369
technology of the day so how do you

00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:31,169
extend open EDX the whole point of

00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:34,619
having an open source code is that it's

00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:37,249
used to use but you can flex it the way

00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:39,929
you want oh I have am using Moodle or

00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:41,940
blackboard I want to use Moodle

00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:45,839
blackboard for that thing that does well

00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:47,999
and I want to use this these open EDX

00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,159
thing for other things I want to do that

00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:53,789
this thing doesn't allows me know me to

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:57,659
do and there's plenty of ways to connect

00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:59,729
this to and to build on top of it to

00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:03,210
create new features that don't exist yet

00:28:59,729 --> 00:29:06,239
and the magic behind this is mostly the

00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:09,479
X block so that's when you add your own

00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:13,109
thing within a web a course a course

00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:15,570
page could be a video could be a game

00:29:13,109 --> 00:29:24,749
could be anything you like that consumes

00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:30,629
data or services and you have hei hei so

00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:33,330
X block it is something created in open

00:29:30,629 --> 00:29:39,989
alexis is there their concept the

00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:42,330
architecture LTI is a protocol create

00:29:39,989 --> 00:29:45,749
builds are designed by an organization

00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:49,080
called IMS and it's an industry standard

00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:51,450
that most learning management systems

00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:54,799
which means put him almost all of them

00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:58,710
in North America are using desire2learn

00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:03,419
blackboard Moodle you name it they all

00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:06,419
using some version of HCI what the kind

00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:09,520
of things LGI allows you to do for

00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:14,260
example is to plug a great book

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:16,810
to it so great book pardon my french but

00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,700
great books sucks a lot of time in the

00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:24,580
other learning management system big

00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:27,310
time mmm your hand big time and and you

00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:30,340
have some very good great books out

00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:32,200
there that people just want to use how

00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:35,650
do we connect this to how do we pass the

00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:39,360
data without compromising security

00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:45,700
student privacy so there is a way to

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:47,860
connect this to system is efficiently so

00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:51,670
the ex block I'm going to pass a little

00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:54,340
bit you know faster on that one it's a

00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:58,060
it's behind the scenes it's a python

00:30:54,340 --> 00:31:00,100
class to python package you you can look

00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,810
at it you know if your Python coder then

00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:06,100
you're going to be at home because it

00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:08,470
just is just one one of these classes

00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:15,910
just behaves the way you great expect

00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:19,900
the python class to work it stores data

00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:24,180
the state's access to two front hand the

00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:29,560
way the way you you expect exactly so

00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:33,070
what about the community the community

00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:35,590
is growing so the communities the more

00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:38,890
people that are using open EDX some of

00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:41,200
them will be using vanilla open EDX some

00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:44,350
of them would be extending upper legs

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,580
bending it to their needs so you're

00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:48,400
going to find national implementation

00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:50,890
France China you're going to find some

00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,920
local implementation like in Spain

00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:56,100
there's a I think mad madrid university

00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:58,450
they're doing some very fancy things in

00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:01,060
automating the creation of courses in

00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:03,640
one hand and how they move students and

00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:06,790
whether you give badges you know some

00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:10,960
you can bend the system to the way your

00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:13,690
university operates versus having to

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,540
deal with the proprietary solution that

00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:18,490
tells you how you should use that system

00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:19,960
you own it so not only you own the

00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,790
software but offer you own the way you

00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,810
do your

00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:30,900
business and that's what makes it quite

00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:32,490
popular so what were you who are the

00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,310
people in the community that people that

00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:36,690
want to they have some ideas about how

00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:38,520
to operate their business if they have

00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:40,560
no idea they'd probably be happy buying

00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:43,410
something out asking somebody watch it

00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:47,730
you should do they need the tools that

00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:49,650
they need flexible choose this is the

00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:52,500
team so I have to say big things because

00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:56,670
this lines so far that they're not mine

00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:59,040
then we provided by jewel and Ned these

00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:03,470
guys are just awesome it's very small

00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:05,970
team molly is a great comedy manager

00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:08,100
they all have a great technical

00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:10,050
background there are other people behind

00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:12,690
the scenes that work on different things

00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:15,510
like they're working a lot in analytics

00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:17,700
and big data and they want to be working

00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:20,520
on predictive analytics and see you know

00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,950
what's guy helping you know providing

00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:26,040
more help and more engagement in the

00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:29,220
platform so it is all happening so big

00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:30,690
thanks to them and now if you have any

00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:36,120
question you can talk to them directly

00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:38,250
you have to call and these are the

00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,620
latest community development so talk

00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:43,200
about thinking about why there are

00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:46,560
people adding to the platform so these

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:49,710
are some examples so however contributed

00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:51,780
the LTI integration they're working on

00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:53,490
that and there's a plus there because

00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:56,550
it's not just hover but there they

00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:57,750
happen to be leading that project so

00:33:56,550 --> 00:34:01,200
there is a group they are working on

00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:03,960
that open craft which one of the partner

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:09,179
actually saw a felony they're working on

00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:11,040
single sign-on single sign on is as a

00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:12,780
student I don't want to type my name and

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,960
password every time i log to a system

00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:17,490
right so and log into university once i

00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,010
want to access all the software

00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:23,070
available at the college whatever my

00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:25,460
organization is it's pretty nice and

00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:28,500
they're also working on some third-party

00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:30,360
authentication so what if i could log in

00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:34,730
with my google account or my Twitter

00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:38,490
account or my open ID account whatever

00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:40,080
you have these hinting thing that that

00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:41,790
means that you start typing something

00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,020
wrong it starts telling you well maybe

00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:47,040
there's something wrong there you should

00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:49,950
pay attention there's creating there is

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:53,600
a polling there is a bunch of very

00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:56,010
interesting things there is a long list

00:34:53,600 --> 00:35:01,070
one of the projects that I found very

00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:05,160
interesting is one about learning paths

00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:09,210
so what if you could suggest a student

00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:12,030
to actually learn in the personalized

00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:14,880
way you know when you have a book you

00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:17,790
have chapter 1 2 3 4 5 1 some people

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,010
would read 1 2 3 4 5 some other people

00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:21,810
would like to jump to chapter 10 do some

00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:24,660
exercise maybe go back to chapter 3

00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:26,760
right so why don't we could suggest that

00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:31,620
so that's this some people working on

00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:33,900
this it's exciting so this is the

00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:37,440
example of a TI integration i was

00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:39,420
talking about the video is and you can

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,000
take a lot of data from videos you can

00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:44,760
get data from an external system and

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:49,460
pipe it in and you can get data on how

00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,460
users interact here and pipe it back

00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:58,680
this is a screenshot of the single

00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:02,880
sign-on so they open crafty is using

00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:06,030
samuel and shiva leg it could use all

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,630
health the google protocol to do single

00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:12,420
sign-on you have different technologies

00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:15,480
the key is you log in once then you can

00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:19,920
access to everything you like is the

00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:23,550
hinting thing and these are the links if

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:26,820
you are interested please do follow do

00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:31,440
go to Twitter and check what's going on

00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:36,270
there go to to you I our IRC client and

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:38,310
hook up with the community there or go

00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:41,460
and check the code if you if you can't

00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:45,300
wait to see Python in action

00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:47,130
and if you have any any question you

00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,619
we're going to be here for for it done

00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:51,420
too so you can talk to us so the next

00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:53,310
question is what the heck are we are

00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:55,740
doing here like what is that we're

00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:58,880
fairly looks how do we come we've been

00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:01,619
involved with that it just happened that

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:05,030
so the company is very active in Quebec

00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:09,630
and has been working with the lab in

00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:11,550
university in Quebec and this lab is all

00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:14,160
these universities very much involved

00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:17,460
with distance education for and they

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,230
have been for a long time and and it

00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:22,190
shows open EDX is a platform and they

00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:25,680
want to do a lot of development on it

00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:28,440
and it's academic lab so they do a lot

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,170
of changes the testing and they go they

00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:33,240
go back and forth and obviously they

00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:37,490
have that scale so they came to several

00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:40,050
felony say can you help me put a modern

00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:42,540
devlet development tool chain and

00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:46,440
integration continuous integration tool

00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:51,000
chain for my developers and my students

00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:54,119
to use open EDX to me to work on it can

00:37:51,000 --> 00:38:00,660
you help me scale up and down with some

00:37:54,119 --> 00:38:02,730
kind of cloud technology so Oh some

00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:05,730
funny looks is going to work on on that

00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:08,849
so there are some specific things on the

00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:11,609
platform we got a look at polling EDX

00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:16,250
basically to OpenStack and helping them

00:38:11,609 --> 00:38:18,300
with their integration so OpenStack is

00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:20,430
you probably heard about it this morning

00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:24,510
jonathan is going to give another talk

00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:26,310
later just after this this hour I think

00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:29,220
it's in the other room but it's going to

00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:31,080
go in deep depth on OpenStack so it's so

00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:34,950
where to basically take your data center

00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:38,130
and help you to consume it as a service

00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:40,320
without being an IT guy we just go up

00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:42,270
there I want this you get it as simple

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,310
as that so there is some kind of

00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:46,349
convergence and then some kind of

00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:48,869
software that tells the computer what to

00:38:46,349 --> 00:38:53,640
do behind the scenes and that's as far

00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:54,960
as I will go on OpenStack I want to

00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,030
spend more time on

00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:02,760
exactly we do there so we're helping

00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:05,730
programmers improve on open EDX so these

00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:08,220
are team and this is our team at the

00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:11,040
University not our team but the customer

00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:14,420
team the lab the research lab at the

00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,680
University and they are going to be

00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:20,060
contributing to modules they're going to

00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:23,190
be improving open EDX will help them

00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:26,040
with call with you so that it can

00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:29,280
collaborate on coding efficiently

00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:31,530
together so how do you establish the

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,330
practice but also the matter the

00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:37,610
methodology but also tools that you need

00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:40,830
to to work efficiently on the same code

00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:43,260
we're going to obviously connect it to

00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:46,410
to get that's going to be the main

00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:50,790
repository so we automate that this

00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:53,100
emerging here and we had the team also

00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:57,990
once they happy with the code we had

00:39:53,100 --> 00:40:01,170
them move the code upstream so they're

00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:05,340
going to be contributing patches up to

00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:07,920
the open EDX platform and they're going

00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:11,450
to be sinking back because that what

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,740
that's the beauty of open source is that

00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:16,020
everybody is kind of working on the same

00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:18,630
big thing so you're working a little

00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:21,450
tiny one percent here you're doing great

00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:24,690
things and you contributing this back up

00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:27,180
and everybody benefits and then you look

00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:29,460
back to the repository up there and you

00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:31,590
start sinking back and you get 99

00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:34,260
percent that the other people have been

00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:37,080
working on and you don't trim it to your

00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:41,820
platform now the problem is is is this

00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:44,910
99 percent going to break your thing so

00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:48,660
we have told this is where the open

00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:51,830
source also has no tools to deal with

00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:54,270
that so we have this team of researchers

00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:57,890
establish a two-way communication there

00:40:54,270 --> 00:41:01,140
to merge a code efficiently basically

00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:04,530
we're also setting them up with some

00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:06,930
continuous integration and some

00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:10,829
automation and so the co

00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:16,710
is easily deployed on the dev and prod

00:41:10,829 --> 00:41:19,200
servers all right so this is what the

00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:22,530
continuous integration is doing then we

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:25,380
are helping them put that on top of

00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:27,450
OpenStack and there are some some things

00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,880
already working on OpenStack but some

00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:33,390
things are little tricky to make it work

00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:37,050
a deck has been developed to work on top

00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:42,930
of Amazon Web Services so you still find

00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:45,569
things that are still looking a little

00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:48,480
hard coded to amazon web services like

00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:50,880
object storage is a good example so our

00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,550
team is going to work on that too so we

00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,130
remove dependencies to Amazon Web

00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:58,740
Services so down the road people want to

00:41:56,130 --> 00:42:01,140
do to actually tech open EDX and move

00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:06,630
them to their OpenStack then they can do

00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:11,640
it very easily just just go straight and

00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:14,819
that's a story that's the story so we

00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:18,089
always i got i get i get the right to do

00:42:14,819 --> 00:42:21,630
my one minute evide exactly would we are

00:42:18,089 --> 00:42:25,440
these guys again so we're company based

00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:29,430
in quebec about 100 people and we're

00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:32,069
expanding where I so certify so more

00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:34,740
than technology and open source which is

00:42:32,069 --> 00:42:36,720
technologies the easy piece we help

00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:40,200
people with their processes we bring

00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:43,740
methodology and where do you find the

00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:45,270
best and most innovative technology

00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:48,900
you're going to find it in the open

00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:50,549
source world so that's where small

00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,500
companies and big companies we're

00:42:50,549 --> 00:42:54,510
talking or Microsoft or big companies

00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:57,030
like that they're looking at several

00:42:54,510 --> 00:43:00,990
fairy looks as a little bit of disruptor

00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:04,049
so they they brought us in when they

00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:07,500
want to to have their team think

00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:09,180
differently and innovate with varying

00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,980
edge technology so we have some of the

00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:13,190
world experts on some of these

00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,780
technologies we are talking about and

00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:19,049
these are some of our clients like I

00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:20,790
drew Quebec the government of Quebec I'm

00:43:19,049 --> 00:43:25,020
going to find so GF was for

00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:27,300
from Ontario that's a good one and we

00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:29,640
are expanding geographically so we have

00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,890
a deficient in Paris since probably last

00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:34,650
year and and today we are opening in

00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:41,430
Toronto and we're happy to have you so

00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:46,110
we're all about innovation we and we

00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:49,470
help companies innovate and and leverage

00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:51,330
the power of collaboration so the old

00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:53,220
world of software is everybody works at

00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:56,070
their desk on the little silos on a

00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:57,510
little black box and we're bringing the

00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:59,160
knowledge of the collaborative

00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:02,130
intelligence and the knowledge had to do

00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:06,600
with that of open source to the business

00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:08,520
world that's what we do and I'm your guy

00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,860
in Toronto if you have any question i'm

00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:13,650
i'm here and jonathan is there for the

00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:16,050
tough questions and OpenStack I can I

00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:20,220
get you down here to answer the tough

00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:23,340
question any questions yes you mentioned

00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:36,240
that Seneca has been involved with X

00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:38,670
please like to tell you a little bit

00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:42,030
it's one of the areas that mark

00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:48,320
to go and that's specifically in terms

00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:48,320
of data collection processing and

00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:56,070
tracking students and doing some

00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:00,180
analytics there yet but we're building

00:44:56,070 --> 00:45:31,140
all the pieces to get there so I'd love

00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:35,610
to hear about it so the presenters small

00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:38,580
gifts like justice so now I assume you

00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:43,440
guys got some set up Lori hooking up the

00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:47,150
top excuse me but thanks so much forget

00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,150
or you'll get that witness a I got it

00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:03,360
imports and we're building our own xbox

00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:06,900
to allow us to collect a lot more

00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:10,260
complex data from so things like

00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:11,400
interacting with instrument from planes

00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:13,920
that

00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,049
we build their own front end platform

00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,900
that does that and we'll send it up to

00:46:16,049 --> 00:46:25,190
the backhand and then Phil is working on

00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:28,410
the back end yes we ex walk as Mark said

00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:31,619
let's see a tube with envy Alex which

00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:34,799
allows us to play with Alex and create

00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:37,500
anything that we want so what we do is

00:46:34,799 --> 00:46:42,180
we're collecting the information from

00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:44,130
the front end by using the juice on like

00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:48,720
based on the JSON file creating the

00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:52,920
front end collecting that and storing in

00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:57,329
the database we can make our adaptive

00:46:52,920 --> 00:47:01,829
learning algorithm and based on that we

00:46:57,329 --> 00:47:05,520
can predict how well the learner can act

00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:09,329
on the on that specific course in terms

00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:12,480
like let's say you have a course which

00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:15,779
consists of different modules and on the

00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:19,829
middle of in the middle of the course we

00:47:15,779 --> 00:47:23,670
already know will the learner perceive

00:47:19,829 --> 00:47:27,000
course well or you will fail that so

00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:29,490
he'll get let's say based on these marks

00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,500
you'll get a pop-up or this play or

00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:37,079
anything which will suggest him to go

00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:39,299
back to specific module and review the

00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:42,329
course or you might want to proceed

00:47:39,299 --> 00:47:44,130
anyway yeah so the idea is what are you

00:47:42,329 --> 00:47:45,680
talking about the learning path so we're

00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:47,970
trying to collect or nothing for

00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,400
for us to be able to predict that the

00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:52,650
users going successfully force or not

00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,569
and if they are already know certain

00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:56,730
material we can suggest them to skip the

00:47:54,569 --> 00:47:58,950
chapter that probably they already know

00:47:56,730 --> 00:48:01,109
the same time and if we know that

00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:02,670
they're going to probably fail Sam with

00:48:01,109 --> 00:48:04,470
the last test then we'll send them back

00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:08,789
to a chapter that we know they're not

00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:11,099
comfortable with and having reviewed so

00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:14,519
that's basically the adaptive learning

00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:16,470
part of our project and ask you a

00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:19,079
question on the first end there there's

00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:23,099
another one there how easy was it for

00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:24,960
you to start with open EDX like what

00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:26,940
it'll work back can you tell us a little

00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,680
bit about that how do you get in the

00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:31,049
ethnic when we started working a little

00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:33,210
harder with documentation like right now

00:48:31,049 --> 00:48:36,079
there's a lot more convocation available

00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:38,130
so it does help us a lot as we go on

00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,289
find a lot of you think the information

00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:43,769
that we can use at first it was very

00:48:40,289 --> 00:48:45,329
difficult but actually right now it's a

00:48:43,769 --> 00:48:47,849
lot easier a lot back to SideReel

00:48:45,329 --> 00:48:50,249
environment up and get xbox the work

00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:52,950
yeah because we've created our own

00:48:50,249 --> 00:48:54,660
communication and I would like to know a

00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:56,430
lot of issues with the connecting

00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:59,039
database systems now how would you do

00:48:56,430 --> 00:49:02,190
this or you did that and then based on

00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:05,789
like waking up any recommendation often

00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:08,279
paddocks we had to like blend over our

00:49:05,789 --> 00:49:11,369
state's and figure out what to do that

00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:13,490
by now I would say we can do anything

00:49:11,369 --> 00:49:15,500
like ninety-nine percent we

00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:18,080
you would possibly think about it we can

00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:19,700
do with the xbox so far any advice very

00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:22,130
quickly before we move to the question

00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:23,990
if any advice like somebody like for

00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:28,190
somewhere in your audience would like to

00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:31,160
jump in whoa what's your advice where

00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:36,170
should I start well just have a good

00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:38,240
connection when you spend hours and

00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:40,280
hours trying to reinstall I like over

00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:43,340
and over again because the Wi-Fi here

00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,900
tiny cup draw connection and then you're

00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:47,480
like oh I'm missing a kind of why I'm

00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:50,119
not sure why and that is probably the

00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:52,130
reason why otherwise they'd just read

00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:55,460
the docs everything is out there right

00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:57,890
now yeah india since it's open source

00:49:55,460 --> 00:50:00,140
community my house on mistakes and

00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:02,330
issues with the communication and like

00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:05,270
me personally I found out like when I

00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:07,400
was a date India I'd exclude the last

00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:10,010
version like a Cypress I had an issue

00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:13,280
deleting the course like me newly

00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:15,560
because the truck Christ it differently

00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:20,060
and then I had to always submit the

00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:21,770
ditch and yourself there you couldn't do

00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:26,600
it with the older communication that

00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:28,910
they have and use the IRC you have like

00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,800
people behind it what I'm at the year is

00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:32,660
that they're very responsive so I never

00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:37,070
tried it myself that's what I already

00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:39,400
there is a question from the back for

00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:39,400
you mark

00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:49,000
well off the record right because we're

00:50:44,269 --> 00:50:54,170
not being taped here it's this

00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:55,819
university of Quebec data Luke I hope

00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:58,430
they don't mind I think they don't mind

00:50:55,819 --> 00:51:02,059
if i share that well then I put a

00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:04,069
question to your petticoat getting a

00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,869
data now this is a light system or you

00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:07,819
get the living room yeah we're working

00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:09,680
at that but yeah I'm collecting today

00:51:07,819 --> 00:51:11,150
all right now so I can have the access

00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,400
and I can retrieve the data from the

00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:22,819
content and all the content based on da

00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:25,970
the library did poll created what's not

00:51:22,819 --> 00:51:27,349
the course of live yet were just

00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:29,500
happening to make sure that we can

00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:32,299
accumulate they are properly and

00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:37,069
hopefully we'll be watching it by the

00:51:32,299 --> 00:51:41,359
end of this year there was a question

00:51:37,069 --> 00:51:44,420
here could you come in on how you

00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:48,380
achieve the marking presumably there is

00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:52,549
some marking so sort of in general but

00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:56,509
more in particular do you give

00:51:52,549 --> 00:51:58,369
sort of quizzes multiple choice or do

00:51:56,509 --> 00:52:03,229
you handle anything beyond that like

00:51:58,369 --> 00:52:07,400
essays or program code at this time it's

00:52:03,229 --> 00:52:09,859
a bit simpler what we're working on in

00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:13,160
multiple choice and interacting with the

00:52:09,859 --> 00:52:15,769
instrument panel inside the plane so

00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:20,420
we're not going as complex as analyzing

00:52:15,769 --> 00:52:23,119
words and Pope yeah great another

00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:26,410
question are there any examples of

00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,410
private corporations

00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:35,690
it's a good question there is a none

00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:41,010
that I can think about that I know about

00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:45,630
but we never know for sure who's using

00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:47,550
it because they don't have to say but

00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:53,900
that you could ask the question to to

00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:53,900
the team there other other question I

00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:59,160
can see and back to you you know your

00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:04,400
point I think in the corporate sector

00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:08,070
there is a lot of needs for training and

00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:10,290
the you know as these tools are growing

00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:13,410
the open source why we're not using them

00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:15,090
makes tons of sense and if you are an

00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:16,560
entrepreneur out there if you look like

00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:18,570
these guys if they wanted to you know

00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:21,270
build their own company then maybe

00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:24,540
there's market you know waiting for them

00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:27,069
there well of course that is on your

00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:32,229
government

00:53:27,069 --> 00:53:37,680
k as requalification course for a curb

00:53:32,229 --> 00:53:40,599
cuts so it's moving in that direction

00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:51,269
but you know we're really talking about

00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:54,190
here they're very early days of a honey

00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:56,910
from I'm thinking about it because of

00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,910
most places

00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:06,880
let's say the staff and faculty that we

00:54:03,339 --> 00:54:09,240
have a thermal cycle go to offer

00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,470
workshop or something on the side

00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,630
there's a probability that they want

00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:15,910
that integrate with their Moodle course

00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:18,940
because we want to duplicate things I

00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:24,309
think that's so I know you said that the

00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:26,799
integrates how well does it or not for

00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:29,140
you how is a good question it's hot it's

00:54:26,799 --> 00:54:32,529
a tough question but I've seen I've seen

00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:36,670
it in canvas for example in mood up seen

00:54:32,529 --> 00:54:38,289
some screenshots so it's possible you

00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:39,700
know how well that works then that's a

00:54:38,289 --> 00:54:42,250
good question yeah we actually have our

00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:46,180
own big blue button project here you

00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:54,630
know as well and using the LTI we were

00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:54,630
able to take an integrated into a quick

00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:59,650
you should try it i think the point of

00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:01,750
the open source also thing is you know

00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:07,020
there's no risk in trying you only can

00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:18,130
get smarter doing it if it's possible

00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:21,930
yes let's do it moodle okay so now let's

00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:25,180
reset that so now move I move course

00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:26,619
great well you should try to move course

00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:29,200
like I see a lot of green shirts I

00:55:26,619 --> 00:55:31,059
assuming you are students I take one

00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:34,210
Evan if you draw it like ninety percent

00:55:31,059 --> 00:55:37,300
draw double-cross anyway but you get the

00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:39,460
experience and no then you need it one

00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:42,040
of the things that amazes me the most is

00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:46,480
the catalog you could learn anything

00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:49,930
right now and if you don't know if you

00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:52,420
want suggestions to learn things go for

00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:54,780
data science or you like banks are crazy

00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:58,380
the financial sector is crazy about it

00:55:54,780 --> 00:56:00,869
it's definitely a skill for the future

00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:04,690
good to have liked for everyone to have

00:56:00,869 --> 00:56:08,849
my two cents any other comments or

00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:08,849
questions or something you want to share

00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:19,270
out of time that's a good one to share

00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:22,559
so thank you so much features i preciate

00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:22,559
