a bit of a story about how all of this

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,120
started I'll give you a 10-second

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,700
overview back a long long time ago I was

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,460
a student here and I was working with

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,660
David on our first Seneca Mozilla

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,880
project together I was very proud at the

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,769
end of that I spent a semester in half

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,990
maybe two semesters working on a project

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:27,510
we're writing some code that ended up in

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,130
Mozilla I thought that was incredible

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,189
back in those days as a student to me

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,110
there was something I couldn't believe

00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:36,899
that pales in comparison to what these

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,790
guys have done they work not a one

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,040
project they work on a major project

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,399
with a bunch of components that the

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,219
project relies on it took years the

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,230
reception has been phenomenal people all

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,210
over the world as soon as it was

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,059
released were using it were praising it

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:58,050
it was all over the media it was very

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:59,520
very exciting stuff I know I watched

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,920
them do the work I don't know what

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,220
they've been doing kind of have some

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,890
ideas but I know it's amazing stuff I

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,350
know that their experience is something

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,470
that everyone can look up to even though

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:17,310
they are still students turns just about

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:20,390
graduating so give them a hand please

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,390
and let go

00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:33,170
so thank you very much especially for

00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:35,630
coming here today at my thirty AM I'm

00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:39,079
Gideon Thomas and this is kyra sedgwick

00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:43,429
we reported the mozilla team at CDOT and

00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:47,689
we're here today to really tell you a

00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:51,079
story about how we build thimble this

00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:53,119
cool new app that we have and a journey

00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:56,179
through two million lines of open source

00:01:53,119 --> 00:02:00,020
code that we went through to accomplish

00:01:56,179 --> 00:02:01,789
the speed we also would like to cover a

00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,590
few lessons that you learn through this

00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:06,770
process and impart that knowledge on to

00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,869
you so before we get started let's start

00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,480
with a little bit of context for those

00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,700
of you who don't know what is thimble

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,079
well let's take a look at a short video

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,079
explaining what that is

00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:36,430
okay so as you can see here this this is

00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:41,180
what symbol is it's basically an editor

00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:45,110
with a real file system an editor a

00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,820
preview and you have all your files here

00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,310
that you would basically want for a web

00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:53,780
project including images as well as

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:56,270
style sheets and your actual HTML so you

00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,800
can even add other files through the

00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:03,530
sleek little interface that we have out

00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:06,110
and what this allows us to do is change

00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:13,450
code in the editor and see live results

00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:13,450
on the right-hand side immediately now

00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:20,180
of course please be realistic chua lee

00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:23,660
have any audio for this so I'm

00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,770
improvising here it also gives you it

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,750
guides you through the process of

00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:29,209
writing coach as you saw there it gives

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,130
you documentation as you type code to

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:36,140
help you understand what you're actually

00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:38,959
typing and another cool feature is that

00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:41,510
it allows you to change the color very

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,840
easily using a color picker for example

00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:47,630
and it in patent includes a lot of other

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,810
really neat features including a

00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:54,080
tutorial so some projects have this

00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:56,540
tutorial on HTML file and what that

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,690
means is you get a tutorial of exactly

00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,590
what you can do in your project

00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,600
including what line number you should

00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:06,260
change what you should change it to and

00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:08,330
what that actually means so there you

00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:11,180
can see again you can change your images

00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:13,160
that you have basically arrest refer to

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,890
anything in your prop systems or that's

00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:19,190
on the web it also allows you to change

00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:23,270
to a mobile preview and give your

00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:25,400
project a really neat name and the best

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,530
part of all is that you can publish this

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,990
onto the web share it with your friends

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:34,130
share it with people and voice your

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:36,430
ideas through web technology and another

00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:39,460
neat feature is that you can allow

00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:41,380
review this project to remix it which

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,470
means they can take this project get the

00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:47,200
code for it and modify it as they need

00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:51,820
it and create their own vision of what

00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:56,320
they imagine the project to be that's

00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:58,510
basically what symbol is but we do want

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,330
you to note something very important our

00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:03,640
presentation isn't focused on what

00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:07,600
symbol is capable of or what isn't

00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:10,450
capable of what we focus on is the

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,350
actual experience of using different

00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:17,500
open-source technologies to build any

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:19,990
product so why should you care about our

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,660
presentation and more importantly why

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:25,260
should you care about using open source

00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,940
technologies in developing your projects

00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:31,420
well it really boils down to saving

00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:34,090
money and saving time saving money in

00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,860
terms of development costs saving money

00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:39,040
in terms of maintenance costs throughout

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,740
the entire project and saving time in

00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:47,410
terms of the time required to actually

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:49,330
write all that code so if you're not

00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:54,130
convinced yet let's take a look at this

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:57,310
I know it's early and I myself am like

00:05:54,130 --> 00:06:00,220
semi-conscious right now so with that in

00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:04,510
mind how many of you by a show of hands

00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:06,600
know about these companies thank you i

00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:12,520
was expecting a much different reaction

00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:14,680
so hopefully you should know that the

00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:18,760
point here is that all these companies

00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,920
use open source technologies in a lot of

00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:24,790
their products a lot of the products

00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:28,240
that you use why that's the question

00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:30,460
really and well it's quite simple all of

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,830
them are businesses and as a business

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,410
they need to make more money and spend

00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:38,650
as little as possible the way they do

00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:40,690
this is by you leveraging open-source

00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:45,820
technologies to reduce significantly

00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:48,270
their development costs one other reason

00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,160
that they would

00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:53,010
to use open source technologies is

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,070
because it promotes innovation in the

00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:58,580
company itself and a great example of

00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:02,190
this is bootstrap which is Twitter's

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:04,590
most popular open-source contribution

00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:09,780
that has completely changed the way that

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:14,040
we do front-end web development so I'd

00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:16,830
like to take a quick detour right now to

00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:19,980
express a sentiment that is echo

00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:23,910
throughout our presentation when the

00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:29,130
store vault is best known as a great

00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:32,250
developer the father of Linux and also

00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:34,440
for having a very sharp tongue so I'd

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:37,700
like to quote him on something recently

00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:41,130
that he said which was I'm a lazy person

00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:45,510
which is why I like open source for

00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:48,000
other people to do work for me that's a

00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:51,540
very powerful message in my mind because

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,570
as we go through the presentation you'll

00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,970
realize that a lot of the code that is

00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:59,640
part of thimble we did not write our

00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:02,850
self in fact we used other people's code

00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:07,520
and the best part of all is we didn't

00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:07,520
pay them for this we got it all for free

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:18,680
so let's get started because our journey

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:22,140
began with an idea an idea that existed

00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:25,680
because of this cool new desktop editor

00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:28,740
called Adobe brackets which was mainly

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:36,600
used to develop other web technologies

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:40,680
and what that meant was we got an idea

00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:42,570
of what if what would happen if we took

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:46,860
this desktop editor to make web

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:49,170
technologies and put it on the web well

00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:53,040
that's sort of begs the question why

00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:55,380
brackets well there are a couple of

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,180
points to remember here firstly not only

00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:00,030
is it used to code web technologies it's

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,860
also built using web technologies so

00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:04,260
it's built as a desktop app you

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,450
saying HTML CSS JavaScript the most

00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,050
basic web technologies and probably the

00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:12,930
most powerful web technologies out there

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:16,230
what this meant was that the chances of

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:18,959
this of us taking this putting it into a

00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:22,529
browser and it just working we're a lot

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,899
higher than using some other code that

00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:26,660
was written in some other language of

00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:29,579
course there are the other points where

00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,890
it was completely open source so that

00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:34,769
meant we could take the code modify it

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:36,779
create a new product out of it and it

00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:40,829
was also very extensible so that meant

00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:44,790
that adding new features two brackets

00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:47,070
was very easy in terms of code which was

00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:52,860
actually a big problem that we had with

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:55,950
thimble initially the final point is

00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,839
probably the most important point of why

00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,120
we decided to choose brackets that's

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,700
that it had an active developer

00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,260
community as you'll see this is echo

00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,690
tile throughout their presentation over

00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,310
and over again brackets had an active

00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,360
developer community and what this

00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:14,579
implied was that we were able to

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,480
leverage the experts on this software

00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:19,769
for help whenever we needed to whenever

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,570
we were stuck on a piece of code

00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:24,420
whenever we needed to get some working

00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:27,329
we could ask them for help and they

00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:29,550
would either contribute code or actually

00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:34,019
just guide us in the right direction and

00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:36,660
this was a really cool thing to have so

00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:41,670
our journey began with an idea of taking

00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:45,600
brackets and there was also an

00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:49,290
opportunity an opportunity to improve an

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,810
existing product that was also called

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,820
thimble and as you can see here this is

00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:57,600
basically what it looked like it was an

00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:01,079
editor a preview type something here it

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,790
will tell you what's wrong and if there

00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:05,519
isn't something wrong it'll immediately

00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:10,010
show you live results in the preview it

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:13,209
was pretty neat but as great as it was

00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:17,389
there were some issues

00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:20,689
firstly adding new features symbol was

00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:24,529
very very difficult for one primary

00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:27,829
reason and that was that this code base

00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:30,139
was built in a really really short span

00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:32,029
of time it's really quickly to get

00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:35,479
something done and to make our users

00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:37,699
happy and that it brings up an important

00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:40,579
point about symbol because this this was

00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:42,709
only initially targeted at new

00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:46,969
developers of web technologies so

00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:50,569
complete beginners to the web another

00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:54,229
point is that because of the way we

00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:59,149
build thimble and in a really quick

00:11:54,229 --> 00:12:01,729
manner adding new features was not even

00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:04,429
planned for so the development of

00:12:01,729 --> 00:12:06,739
symbols are too stalled and it was

00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:12,169
really hard to extend it beyond its

00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:15,049
capabilities so we thought here's an

00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:18,739
opportunity what if we took thimble and

00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:21,769
made it easily updatable what if we were

00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:26,329
able to respond to user requests for new

00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:30,229
features quickly and what if we could

00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:34,819
expand our user base by allowing thimble

00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:37,069
too easily to allow allow us to easily

00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:39,349
add new features that would cater to

00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:44,059
advanced users a lot more easily and

00:12:39,349 --> 00:12:50,259
thimble so let's go ahead first into the

00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:53,599
first 490,000 lines of code off the bat

00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:55,729
before I go further however I'd like to

00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:58,129
inform you that as we do this

00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:59,449
presentation we're going to be counting

00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:01,549
the number of lines of code that's

00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:05,419
actually in this project with you guys

00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:08,629
using a very simple tally system so as a

00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:11,749
proof of concept we took brackets put it

00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:15,829
into your browser and immediately we

00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:19,339
already had leveraged 461 thousand lines

00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:21,769
of code I mean that's all that's a huge

00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:24,920
number we didn't write any of this code

00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:29,750
but we still used it in our product

00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:32,000
so that's that's really valuable to us

00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:35,149
because that saves us a lot of time a

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:41,209
lot of development costs that we could

00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:43,459
just cut off from symbol but of course

00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:46,310
with any software nothing's ever that's

00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:48,740
simple you can't just take brackets put

00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:51,410
it into the browser and oh my god it

00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:55,010
just works virtually that didn't happen

00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:58,250
so there came our first challenge we

00:13:55,010 --> 00:14:00,589
needed files and the reason we needed

00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:04,310
files was because initially the first

00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:06,889
symbol the restoration of thimble only

00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:08,870
work with one file so you had your HTML

00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:11,510
you could put your CSS and JavaScript

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,269
but it all had to be in one file and you

00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:16,070
would get your end result on the right

00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:18,320
brackets however had a different concept

00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:21,279
in mind it worked in terms of projects

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,110
and projects by definition means

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,630
multiple files so we needed a way to

00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:29,690
make that possible and what that implied

00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:34,339
was we needed a file system that could

00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:35,720
work in a browser so we searched and we

00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:38,269
actually didn't have to search that far

00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:43,550
because we found a library called filer

00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:48,410
jas filer GS was code that we borrowed

00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:50,269
and well and the best part about it was

00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:54,529
that it was exactly what we needed it

00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:56,690
was a file system in a browser so if we

00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:59,029
actually add the lines of code that we

00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,800
use from filer GS it's another twenty

00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:04,730
eight thousand lines of code that we

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,490
didn't write so a total of four hundred

00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,860
ninety thousand lines of code we haven't

00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:13,310
written so far and temples already

00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:19,459
halfway through being done amazing isn't

00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:21,709
it so after that we took filer added it

00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:24,680
to brackets put it in the browser add a

00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:28,760
little water and presto we have an

00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:32,750
editor in a browser yay however there's

00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:35,199
a small technicality when we say we we

00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:38,720
really read David Humphrey which is our

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,239
delete project developer on symbol at

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,729
Saddam

00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:47,169
david had presented this stage of the

00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:51,799
project already to us and Mozilla in

00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:55,129
2013 and his groundwork with fire jas

00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:57,319
and his prototype for getting brackets

00:15:55,129 --> 00:16:00,649
to work in a browser really showed

00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:02,989
Mozilla and us the real potential of

00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:05,919
brackets and what is capable of and why

00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:08,329
this would be a great idea to do and

00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:11,599
this is what it looked like in the end

00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:13,970
we had her file system that was based on

00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:16,970
filer we had brackets and it was all

00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:19,279
just working in a browser perfectly and

00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:21,289
the best part about this was it was even

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:27,319
working in Internet Explorer at this

00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:28,970
time it's very important for us so this

00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:32,359
brings us to our first lesson lesson

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:36,739
number one open source opens up new

00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:38,989
possibilities and this is very important

00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:42,709
because the new thimble was only

00:16:38,989 --> 00:16:45,259
possible because firstly we didn't have

00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:49,720
to pay for those four hundred and ninety

00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:52,459
thousand lines of code that we borrowed

00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,229
second most important point is that we

00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:56,449
didn't need to spend the amount of time

00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:58,999
which is actually a very significant

00:16:56,449 --> 00:17:00,379
factor because that writing for under

00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:03,109
ninety thousand lines of code is not

00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:06,350
easy it takes a lot of time to write

00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:09,379
that where symbol was done really in a

00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:13,970
not a very long amount of time certainly

00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:16,939
not years so with regards to that where

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:18,980
does that leave us at this point well i

00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:24,379
hope to rely on Kieran for that to

00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:26,480
continue this journey thank you so you

00:17:24,379 --> 00:17:28,399
might have noticed when you saw what

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,850
brackets was after it was put in a

00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:33,919
browser that it was missing a few pieces

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:37,039
from that initial thimble animation that

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,200
you saw so our next stage of development

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,419
was moving towards parody and this was

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,269
our next approximately hundred thousand

00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:46,700
lines of code so what were we missing

00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:50,000
well you can see that we have the editor

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:53,030
on the left and you have some user

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,060
interface pieces but there is a

00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:58,070
inside of the screen is probably the

00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,510
most important feature for the people

00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:02,000
learning to use the web which is this

00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:05,630
live preview so we needed to add

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,430
something equivalent to that and this

00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,230
was our second challenge because this

00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:11,390
wasn't easy but luckily we did have a

00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:13,360
place to start Adobe had done some

00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:16,400
experiments towards this sort of

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,020
potential and we took another experiment

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,940
made by David Humphrey called no host

00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,620
and combine these two together pulled

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,620
out a few pieces that broke the browser

00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:27,730
and in the process learned Adobe's code

00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:30,170
and this was all it took in the end

00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,420
which makes it sound a lot easier than

00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:36,140
it was to provide that same

00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:38,060
functionality and this highlighted a

00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,880
lesson for us which was that when you

00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:42,980
choose to adopt an open source library

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,720
into your own product it means that you

00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,130
have to invest time in learning their

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,980
code especially if you want to make any

00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,760
significant changes for us this time

00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:54,350
investment was maybe a few months a year

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,970
but certainly less than it would have

00:18:54,350 --> 00:19:00,890
taken us to develop this from scratch

00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:04,640
which is a theme that you'll see so now

00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:06,080
we had the live preview working but that

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,820
wasn't quite enough to get brackets

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,270
ready for the prime time we also needed

00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,710
to remove a few features that were part

00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:15,110
of the original product that we no

00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:17,780
longer needed like the UI that came with

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:19,520
brackets status bars extensions that

00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,560
came with brackets that bloated it and

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,630
made it slower to download pieces like

00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:26,570
this and in the end we ended up with a

00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:30,380
working preview with multi file projects

00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:31,700
and on a small team with just probably a

00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,830
few months of work at this point and

00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,970
this is what it ended up looking like so

00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:38,480
you can see that we're steadily moving

00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:40,250
towards that thimble feel where we have

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,640
the code on the left and the preview on

00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:45,800
the right and we're almost there so by

00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,630
the time all was said and done at this

00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,610
point in development we probably removed

00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:52,940
more code than we'd added and this left

00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:55,670
our totals at something more like this I

00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:59,000
want to draw your attention to that

00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:02,450
center column and the number 866 that's

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,820
how many lines of code approximately we

00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,430
had written to accomplish what you just

00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:12,830
saw think about that for

00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:16,220
second 461 thousand lines of code for

00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:18,800
brackets nearly 30,000 lines of code for

00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,390
filer a couple more thousand lines of

00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,810
code for the no host library that we

00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:25,700
used and we wrote a paltry thousand to

00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:27,860
get as far as we were this is something

00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:32,180
special on a rotating team of four to

00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:35,000
five developers not bad so we had this

00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,590
interface and now we needed to bring it

00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
up to parody you could see that it

00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:40,760
wasn't quite the same it was just

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,080
brackets that we touched so far and the

00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,250
old thimble had a couple of important

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,110
features that we've already explained

00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:47,150
like the ability to save your projects

00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:49,160
and to publish and share them and so

00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:52,250
before we could really say that brackets

00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:56,540
was ready to be used it had to allow for

00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:58,670
these features so we were left with a

00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:02,150
choice we could either create this new

00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:04,370
thimble from scratch or we could adopt

00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:07,610
the old thimble code base and so we had

00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:08,960
to weigh these options if we did keep

00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,970
the old thimble it would mean that we

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,730
didn't have to write as much code which

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:16,670
is a big deal we hate reinventing the

00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:18,560
wheel so this was a big appeal and would

00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:20,510
also mean tearing code out rather than

00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,190
adding code in removing the old editor

00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:24,800
removing the old preview and stuffing

00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,780
brackets in in its place and as I

00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,760
already mentioned we wouldn't want to

00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,620
resolve the problems that we had already

00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,630
painstakingly solved in our previous

00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,670
cycle when we developed the initial

00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:36,110
symbol and finally that touches on the

00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:38,450
fact that there was a whole community of

00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:42,020
developers who had gone into actually

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:43,610
building that first iteration and if we

00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,990
stuck to the old code base we might have

00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:47,450
been able to leverage their experience

00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:48,770
as well but on the downside it meant

00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,200
that we had to wade into code that

00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:54,320
hadn't been touched in a long time

00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,970
relearn it and there was a final piece

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,800
to that puzzle which was that thimble

00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:00,320
was a part of a bigger initiative called

00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:02,390
webmaker and that meant that it was

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,580
interconnected tightly tightly coupled

00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:06,800
to a bunch of other applications and

00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,990
services that were slowly being phased

00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,940
out in sunsetted and that meant that

00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,110
developing this locally was going to be

00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,130
a bit of a nightmare for the first

00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:18,470
little while I'll cut the tension we

00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:20,360
chose to keep the old thimble and to

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,840
revamp it the main reason was we didn't

00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,669
have time to

00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,070
waste we didn't have the resources to go

00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:26,779
about building something new and we knew

00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,000
the technology was built on the Express

00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:30,529
j/s stack is very popular and this was

00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,400
the technology that was underlying

00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:36,350
thimble and switching to something new

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,240
which we might have considered so that

00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:40,549
is to say switching to a new technology

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,690
to build out this server we might have

00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:43,220
considered if we were starting from

00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,720
scratch and that would have met

00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,029
everybody on the team learning at once

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,150
whereas with the experience that we had

00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:51,409
at least some of the developers knew the

00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:54,890
technology that we were working with

00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:56,960
with the old code base and again the old

00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:59,419
contributors were something we could

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:04,460
probably leverage if we decided to keep

00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:07,429
the code so if we check in again and we

00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:09,140
add the lines of code used in the

00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:11,630
Express framer which by the way is very

00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:14,539
very popular in the node.js world which

00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:16,309
is what the server-side technology we

00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:19,309
use to build this product in the first

00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:20,990
place Express is very very popular if we

00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:24,039
throw that in and we also throw in the

00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:26,799
line count of thimble when we adopted it

00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:29,179
then you can see that our total is

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,890
steadily going up and it's dropped a bit

00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:32,990
the number hasn't changed too much

00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:35,120
because we tore codes out of brackets

00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:39,080
code out of brackets went as well as

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:42,590
adding some stuff in so we're getting

00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:44,779
there and now we had to face the third

00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:48,679
challenge which was to add those

00:23:44,779 --> 00:23:50,809
publishing features back in so old

00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,309
thimble had a publishing solution but

00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:54,289
that publishing solution was being

00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:56,480
deprecated along with the rest of the

00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:59,059
web maker sweet so this was something we

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,590
had to rebuild and that meant we had a

00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:04,549
choice about what tech we wanted to use

00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:05,990
and when we built it we knew that this

00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:09,679
would involve teaching thimble how to

00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:11,750
use this new service so this is always a

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,940
challenge for developers do you pick the

00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:16,159
shiny new is bang thing that all the

00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,899
cool kids are playing with or do you

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,970
stick to something more familiar maybe a

00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:21,500
little more pedestrian but predictable

00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,440
something that people know how to work

00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,899
with and so we weighed these options if

00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,070
we kept to what was known then we would

00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:29,390
have to learn a little less which is

00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,100
nice because that would meant more time

00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:32,570
coding features we would have more

00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,010
access to contributors because they

00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,520
would already know the technology and

00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,590
have that

00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,020
foundation that is needed to even get

00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:40,430
involved on the other hand if we went to

00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,530
something new it could perhaps be more

00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:46,310
specialized more apt for this particular

00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:48,290
use case and there is one other factor

00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:49,700
that has nothing to do with open source

00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:51,890
and that is that we had access to a

00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:54,320
brilliant developer who promised us that

00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:56,960
if we used this new technology she could

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,910
build it for us in a week the basic

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,860
version of this and so we took her up on

00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:03,170
that and we're gonna skip ahead and

00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:07,280
we're gonna add a few of the other major

00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:08,780
libraries and our final line counts of

00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:15,820
how much code we actually ended up

00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:18,860
writing approximately so this represents

00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:21,590
the main dependencies third party

00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:23,510
libraries that we leveraged the old

00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:26,690
fimble code base that we revamped and

00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:28,250
all of the code that we wrote to create

00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:31,520
what you saw in that video at the

00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:35,420
beginning for sixteen thousand lines of

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:37,700
code so we've developed a product that

00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,920
acts like gold thimble did but has a

00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,510
boatload of new features and we've

00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,960
accomplished all of our goals with that

00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:47,510
paltry sum of code written for those of

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,910
you who like math the ratio of code that

00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,470
we wrote or sorry code that we leveraged

00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:53,210
or borrowed to code that we wrote is

00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:56,180
about thirty three two one that's about

00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:59,260
three percent of the total code base

00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:02,210
that we ended up using was code of ours

00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:07,100
bit of a mind blow but it came at a cost

00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:08,630
and this is our third lesson and it's a

00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,270
pretty important one and that is that

00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:14,450
when you leverage open-source tech it is

00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:17,380
a double-edged sword because third party

00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:20,330
libraries range from New and immature

00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,800
too old and well maintained and in our

00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:24,560
case some of the worst issues that we

00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,570
faced was documentation just not

00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:29,210
existing or being completely inaccurate

00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:31,190
or confusing and misleading lack of

00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,780
support if contributors weren't actively

00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,400
developing the projects anymore meant

00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,980
that there was no one to turn to to ask

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,990
questions and features we sometimes

00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:41,300
assumed would exist in these libraries

00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:44,450
that we were leveraging just didn't or

00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:47,049
were incomplete so in the end what this

00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,820
actually meant was that and this is more

00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:50,440
the spirit of open source we had to

00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:53,860
contribute back to fill in those gaps

00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:57,610
and this meant more lines of code from a

00:26:53,860 --> 00:27:00,100
business standpoint so just to touch

00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:03,720
back on what we've learned so far open

00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:05,799
source presents new opportunities and

00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,659
also means that you might have to learn

00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:09,759
a code base you didn't before if you

00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:11,320
wrote it yourself and in the end when

00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:13,779
you run into problems you can't always

00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,070
rely on the products you're leveraging

00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:17,379
to have the solutions you might actually

00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,269
have to get in get in there and get your

00:27:17,379 --> 00:27:23,470
hands dirty to write those pieces

00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:24,850
yourself so you might have noticed again

00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:27,419
if you're into math that our math

00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:30,429
doesn't really add up to two million yet

00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:31,419
well our estimates were based the ones

00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:33,190
at least in the video or the

00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:36,220
presentation that you've seen so far on

00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:38,769
the main libraries that we use but those

00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,419
libraries relied on even more open

00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:42,879
source libraries so there's this giant

00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:44,289
pool and so we're going to include a few

00:27:42,879 --> 00:27:47,519
more of the most important ones in this

00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:51,279
next slide and we're going to to do a

00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:55,659
cost projection with some caveats but

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:57,789
hold on to your seats so while you

00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:59,830
absorb those staggeringly not large

00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:01,720
numbers I'll explain what you're

00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:03,940
actually looking at so these are

00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,809
estimations of how much it would cost if

00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:10,179
a single developer was paid a salary of

00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:13,090
55,000 dollars a year to develop each of

00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:15,609
these products it's based on the kokomo

00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:17,169
model which is typically most accurate

00:28:15,609 --> 00:28:19,989
when it's used with a large mature

00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:23,559
codebase to estimate the cost and it's

00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:24,850
also not not used too often with the the

00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:26,970
distributed nature of open source

00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:29,980
technologies usually meant for

00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:33,789
standardized commercial development but

00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:36,509
even if we cut that number down by

00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:38,919
ninety percent you're looking at 10

00:28:36,509 --> 00:28:41,769
approximately ten million dollars of

00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:45,340
code we didn't write even if you cut it

00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:48,909
down further than that you're looking at

00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:51,960
a million dollars if you go to just one

00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:57,070
percent of this estimate which is a

00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:59,289
standard this is phenomenal and really

00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,490
demonstrates how much value you can rip

00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:02,980
out of

00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:04,690
the open source community and eventually

00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:10,600
give back with all of the updates that

00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:13,600
you put in so this kind of leads us to

00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,860
the end of the presentation and we'd

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:24,850
like to know if you have any questions

00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:32,530
about what you've seen today starting on

00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:35,380
that side um quite a bit actually we

00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:37,179
especially on the bracket side we ended

00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:39,790
up identifying a number of problems that

00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:41,950
were by the filed upstream that they fix

00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:45,370
for us or that they were very interested

00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:46,890
in taking because they kind of wanted to

00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:49,720
go in the direction that we were heading

00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:53,260
with the live preview in the same pain

00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:55,420
and pieces similar to that so they were

00:29:53,260 --> 00:30:00,220
very interested in finding ways to use

00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:04,240
what we done other things like so

00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:06,460
quadrant is we we placed over the truth

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,400
of it here which was that it was built

00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:14,230
by Mozilla contributor and David

00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:15,790
Humphrey and this this library although

00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:18,300
wasn't built for brackets which is why

00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:21,070
we included it as a separate third-party

00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:23,770
blogger was something that we were

00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:26,670
patching constantly so it got updated a

00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,670
lot because of our work

00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:39,840
so when you're right how many live

00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:45,030
browser word is this right you want a

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:47,730
pebble sure so we're in these lines of

00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:52,950
code live so no chance to the platform

00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:55,020
we use to run thimble and so no TS

00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:57,300
itself we haven't touched any on thought

00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,340
codes it's just the platform we use to

00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:02,660
open source code but it's over 2 million

00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:05,880
lines of code life that we wrote lives

00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:09,360
lives and thimble which is the server

00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:11,940
that we created that runs on nodejs so

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:15,000
we wrote about a much 11,000 lunch

00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:16,920
killed approximately and most of that

00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,470
about well actually let's say about half

00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:22,740
of that runs on the server side on top

00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:24,750
of no chips the other half actually runs

00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,580
in your browser which is what you

00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:30,360
actually got to see the front end part

00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:33,360
of it the cool looking green you I that

00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:36,210
he saw that was the other half of eleven

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:39,180
thousand lines of code and all the other

00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:42,600
things Express jas lot that was service

00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:44,520
side half of jas a lot of that was

00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,380
against every side all these were all

00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:51,440
frameworks that were built on top of

00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:55,500
nodejs brackets the actual 400,000

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:58,440
490,000 my cover was eyes actually again

00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:01,530
in your browser and just an interesting

00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:04,230
technical note at less or around a

00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:07,850
megabyte the entire application which

00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:10,550
was kind of a cool really yeah so for

00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:13,830
actually one of the factor 2011 code

00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:15,660
compress down to one megabyte it

00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:19,830
actually is really impressive let me

00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:23,149
make you that so yeah the rabbit's lives

00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:25,009
in your browser hottest involved what

00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,839
your browser so in terms of a first time

00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:30,739
in there how much code that we wrote

00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:33,619
lives in your browser it's still about

00:32:30,739 --> 00:32:35,929
only two percent or about three percent

00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:38,779
the rest of the code because brackets

00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:51,559
uses most of that code as contributes to

00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:54,799
most of that yes sir let's take off for

00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:57,019
me back 12 periods like I would bring

00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,019
you guys felt ripped giving them a time

00:32:57,019 --> 00:33:01,879
enemy so that's a good question that

00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:05,299
answer because we don't we don't run the

00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:08,570
books but there were 12 there was at

00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:12,349
least one full-time developer for the

00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:14,299
majority of the development cycle if we

00:33:12,349 --> 00:33:17,119
I think we try to average it last night

00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:19,969
we came up to about three or four

00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:22,399
full-time developers or the space of say

00:33:19,969 --> 00:33:25,039
eight months so whatever that cost would

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:27,489
would equate to okay maybe the freshmen

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:30,549
work there you use that same Kokomo

00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:34,190
model for your number one

00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:35,870
well it's a tricky business if we were

00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:37,399
to try and apply that model it wouldn't

00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:39,169
actually be accurately this is one of

00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:41,389
the things that we discovered is that it

00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:43,549
is best used with the bigger code basis

00:33:41,389 --> 00:33:46,850
which is why we stuck to those those

00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:48,139
more significant needy ones this is

00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:49,370
question that's very interesting it's

00:33:48,139 --> 00:33:51,289
something that if we had a little more

00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:53,000
time it would have explored more because

00:33:51,289 --> 00:33:59,870
that is the other half of the business

00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:05,269
piece yes so we focus on instructor

00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:08,060
perspective that's instructor yeah I'm

00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:10,879
just curious because the learning that

00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:13,220
you've got he had to build a course

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,929
around that how would that fit it with

00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:19,790
in existing cycles or 14 week semester

00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:21,740
there are so many moving parts but the

00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:25,010
reality is what you see is whether it's

00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:27,500
a great project the reality is that

00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:30,470
that's what development has become so

00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:32,569
interested oh are you speak to them

00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:34,970
because you are students here so you

00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:37,700
have the footy bean cycle but then a lot

00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:39,770
of this but I don't know why you're so

00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:42,050
the question is if we were to have

00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:45,079
developed something like this as part of

00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:47,149
school how are you how you create a

00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:48,889
course around something like around the

00:34:47,149 --> 00:34:51,679
development cycle no no just a learning

00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:53,710
that you had right now because there is

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,710
a

00:34:54,490 --> 00:35:05,119
discover gates which to so I think

00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:10,280
Charlie answer none that is actually a

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:14,450
very complex question and i'm going to

00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:17,570
say personally we had to do something

00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:20,750
very similar in a course currently being

00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:22,730
taught at seneca call it's called the

00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:26,180
open-source development course top idea

00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:28,849
how creative dad and he goes through

00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:31,579
this procedure and he explains to us how

00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:34,430
technology how software software

00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:37,550
development cycle is riddled with

00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:41,109
changes you are going to change your

00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:44,599
approach your code base whatever it is

00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:47,420
throughout the entire process how so how

00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:50,119
do you bow set up by looking at existing

00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:53,210
code bases i'm curating a small amount

00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:54,410
of co2 that to make it your own so all

00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:58,130
these things are actually covered in

00:35:54,410 --> 00:36:00,470
that course and what you end up with is

00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:02,390
a great product now how to actually

00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:05,089
combine all these different open source

00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:09,890
technologies that's a little harder i

00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:12,170
would say that takes that would take a

00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:14,839
bit of experience with working with real

00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:17,180
projects so coming up with an idea

00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:20,300
probably the first exactly the way we

00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:23,569
started come up with an idea look for an

00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:26,390
opportunity if we can cut if we can

00:36:23,569 --> 00:36:27,619
motivate students to do that which again

00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,240
it's hard and of course they're

00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:32,780
constrained by time you're constrained

00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:36,050
by other horse courses so that can be

00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:38,960
hard but if you can actually motivate

00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:41,750
them to start with those two the rest

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,130
started just falls in especially with

00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:45,770
the way you've learned the open-source

00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:49,349
course and they sort of figure it out

00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:52,019
that okay i want to is idea how

00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:54,269
she realize this well I don't want to

00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:57,329
write that much code because this idea

00:36:54,269 --> 00:36:59,690
it might need million-dollar idea might

00:36:57,329 --> 00:37:02,999
be this really great innovative thing

00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:06,720
but it's really really hard to do okay

00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:09,390
as you may have experienced students

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,479
first approaches ok let me google this

00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:14,940
result of this question and most of them

00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:17,190
looking back I have this idea I have

00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,619
this opportunity let me Google if

00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:21,809
someone's already solved this or let's

00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:25,979
let me Google if someone has already

00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:29,160
solved part of this let me use that code

00:37:25,979 --> 00:37:30,839
and then build upon that so without

00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:34,920
being a course from that strategy it's

00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:37,640
really hard to 15 14 weeks because it

00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:41,249
took us eight months to do this and I

00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:43,470
would say it's more important to embed

00:37:41,249 --> 00:37:47,309
all those concepts of how this process

00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:49,950
occurs and encourage them to learn this

00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:52,259
on their own yeah if I was to just a

00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:54,930
little bit to that I'd say that the

00:37:52,259 --> 00:37:57,359
cycle of open-source development is very

00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:58,859
similar no matter what you're doing them

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,450
out of the scope you're looking at I

00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:03,059
mean obviously the bigger the project

00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:04,829
had a bigger the goal the more the more

00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:08,130
times you have to go through it but the

00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:09,779
cycle of research find the library

00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:13,049
figure out if it does what you want

00:38:09,779 --> 00:38:14,910
Patchett Research Fund library do etc

00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:16,979
etc that is something that can be taught

00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:18,779
that fame is very good at teaching in it

00:38:16,979 --> 00:38:22,109
is something that I think you probably

00:38:18,779 --> 00:38:23,789
even make an entire stream out if not

00:38:22,109 --> 00:38:29,219
that I'm qualified button thought that

00:38:23,789 --> 00:38:32,329
would be my life in it but yes what I

00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:32,329
obviously know you guys

00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:37,430
but I was interested to build on my

00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:39,080
marks asking I'm interested to know

00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:40,610
because I don't really answer to this

00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:44,090
I've taught a lot of students who don't

00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:46,940
achieve what unity so I'm interested to

00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:48,770
know what it is about project like this

00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:53,180
he didn't you didn't come up with this

00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:54,920
project it was handed to you and it

00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:57,170
wasn't always fun I mean you heard the

00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:00,220
end of it and successful and there's a

00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:05,150
lot of pain and just somewhere is hard

00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:07,940
what motivated you in all of the

00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:09,980
different things that you did what kept

00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:13,820
you coming back to it and if you could

00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:15,290
extrapolate what are the likely things

00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:17,510
that we could do with other students

00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:19,220
that would motivate them to want to do

00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:21,770
the kinds of cycles you're talking about

00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:23,690
what kept you from giving up what you

00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:25,280
come back with you more what inspires

00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:30,820
you what motivated with what make

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,820
excited in paint something like this you

00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:44,150
sure okay well I'm these how these add

00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:47,090
the two cents here in all honesty it's a

00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:51,200
lot of it had to do with the experience

00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:55,880
of failure you start with like we worked

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:58,670
on other projects before and like like

00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:01,460
we're not tithing this we we didn't

00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:03,970
really they weren't real successes there

00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:06,940
were great projects great ideas great

00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:10,580
opportunities but the amounted to

00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:13,040
nothing in the end and what that sort of

00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:16,400
does it it sort of build up a fire in

00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,960
YouTube just proved that wrong that no

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,270
you're like every time you do this

00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:23,750
you're not going to fail because other

00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:26,099
people have done this so if I were to

00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:28,069
add to a hybrid answer one of your

00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:30,269
which is how do you motivate students

00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:33,420
probably show that other people have

00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:38,489
done this so showing them simple great

00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:41,039
example of how they can try something it

00:40:38,489 --> 00:40:44,029
is also important to tell them that yes

00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:46,829
it's likely that they would also fail

00:40:44,029 --> 00:40:49,289
but again it's like it's the old saying

00:40:46,829 --> 00:40:55,200
look keep on trying and prime the prime

00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:58,470
are trying dad or whatever it but yes

00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,019
basically basically that like I would

00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:02,519
say that the passion is developed by

00:41:00,019 --> 00:41:06,479
experiencing the bad side of it first

00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:09,799
and then it sort of makes successful

00:41:06,479 --> 00:41:12,539
lots of year you implement fruit exactly

00:41:09,799 --> 00:41:14,339
and that's what brought him back to the

00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:17,819
project over and over again maybe we

00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:18,989
should hear something yeah so that's

00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:26,220
getting was talking I was thinking about

00:41:18,989 --> 00:41:29,519
it and in my case it really motivated me

00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:32,460
to see that these skills that I was

00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:34,890
learning programming and the reasoning

00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:37,319
and design and all of this actually had

00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:40,219
context now there was something real

00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:44,130
real world to fit it into it wasn't just

00:41:40,219 --> 00:41:47,579
some contrived number cruncher to spit

00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:50,039
dates out backwards in a data structures

00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:52,589
course it was actually something that

00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:55,109
not only produced an end result whether

00:41:52,589 --> 00:41:57,180
it was a wild success or just something

00:41:55,109 --> 00:42:00,599
to show off as a technical achievement

00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:02,430
but it also meant that I knew that I

00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:04,349
created something people would use there

00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:05,940
was a moment a particular moment and

00:42:04,349 --> 00:42:08,849
this isn't a code contribution but it

00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,950
was it was close where I had been

00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:12,960
developing a piece of this and I ran

00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:14,940
into a particular challenge and it was a

00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,299
nightmare no one had the answer this I

00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:20,130
crawled the internet and deepest depths

00:42:18,299 --> 00:42:22,650
of stack overflow and I still couldn't

00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:24,809
find and answer it so i hacked my way

00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:27,769
around it I posted that solution on

00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:29,580
github and my woke up a few weeks later

00:42:27,769 --> 00:42:30,840
leary on looked at my

00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,730
computer and saw that I had

00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,830
notifications on github from people I've

00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:40,500
never seen before and was people going

00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:42,300
thank you we thank you and so I had this

00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:45,330
feeling of I'm involved in something

00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:48,960
bigger than me and I'm leaving an

00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:51,090
imprint I I'm having an impact and the

00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,490
combination of having a skill set that

00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:55,440
felt like it was real home because I

00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:57,920
knew how to use version control and I

00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,190
new code review and I had actually

00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:05,220
learned the language through experience

00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:07,770
with this ability to give something real

00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:10,290
to other people that they valued made

00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:11,730
all of the failures and all of the the

00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:13,950
tremendous frustration because it is

00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:15,780
frustrating to do open source

00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:17,970
development sometimes worth it I

00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:20,280
actually managed to get that back and

00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:22,470
then became addicted come my my metaphor

00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,690
is you only learn to love spicy food

00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:27,450
like eating a crapload of spicy food

00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:30,540
eventually the burn you just come to

00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:32,460
love it and it in the end that that was

00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:35,280
the final whip on the straw I just died

00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:41,730
on I'm addicted now good at disagree

00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:44,060
with last things I mean enough of it any

00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:46,650
other part that was a great question yes

00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:48,330
understood in the point in which you

00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:51,420
made a decision

00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:54,810
alternative and put up on a slide and

00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:57,360
into was here in here his looked at it

00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:59,280
and talked about 20 minutes later we

00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,640
said earlier than this so he took that

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:05,220
on past a certain point so how did you

00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,440
take that path it wasn't experiences at

00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:09,480
a slide show and the second one is fun

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,340
too did you ever have thought to go who

00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,650
took this path but what about isn't

00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:16,320
taking the other one would have been

00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:18,870
better different you learn so I'll take

00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:21,300
the first part of that it's always a

00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:23,190
tough decision and you have to weigh a

00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:25,410
bunch of options and we had a couple of

00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:26,910
turning points and a couple of frank

00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:29,100
discussions with each other in the team

00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:31,320
to see sort of where we should take it

00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:34,020
but we were relying on the experience of

00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:36,180
not just our group but on the experience

00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:38,130
of this entire pool and developers that

00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:41,250
had been working on open source projects

00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:43,920
for a long long and we will I'd on that

00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:46,290
and so we made our decision at one point

00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:50,490
for whichever reason it was and just

00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:53,220
sort of how to spit the path also to

00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:58,140
your point about didn't be able to take

00:44:53,220 --> 00:45:00,240
about footing as Karen mentioned that

00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:02,310
open source software development can be

00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,560
quite frustrating sometimes and that

00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:07,710
will happen regardless of which path we

00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:10,290
choose so based on our experience

00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:14,460
whatever we actually did encounter a

00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:17,280
frustrating point while developing wild

00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:20,910
development using web boys for the path

00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:22,950
that we chose we always did thing but

00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:26,150
what if we actually did it that way we

00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:28,890
would never have had this problem and

00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:32,280
there they're both present comes to that

00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:34,860
that line of thought I mean the most

00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,840
obvious comp being ok it's too late to

00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:40,920
go back now and try and see what would

00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:42,480
happen and the most important i would

00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:46,860
say the most important cotton would be

00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:51,130
that we made this decision

00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:55,690
not based on blind faith we backed it up

00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:58,420
with a couple of facts or with whatever

00:45:55,690 --> 00:46:01,960
but this decision was not made blindly

00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:04,240
so what I would say that once we made

00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:08,680
that decision we were pretty strongly

00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:11,320
stuff by we probably stop by it and even

00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,790
though we wonder occasionally what if we

00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,560
still said okay this was still in the

00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:17,200
right approach because all these reasons

00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,880
that you chose identities am I gonna

00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,790
just one tiny little piece to that which

00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:24,040
is sometimes we did have to try the

00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:26,230
other way we would try the first way and

00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:28,660
realize we were wrong have exploded our

00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:30,760
face or be like this problem is just too

00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:33,730
big and we end up having to go back

00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:36,760
anyway so it's kind of illusionary

00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:40,090
choice sometimes anyway I think we're

00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:41,440
about close to the end here so we'll

00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:43,330
probably leave it there you've been

00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,650
great thank you for coming out of the

00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:46,650
