well all I everyone so um now we will

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:20,550
have the presentation of OpenStack in

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:29,670
Canada our speaker is Jonathan French

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:32,130
okay sorry okay jonathan is EVP love the

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:37,140

00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:50,550
my friend i have a weird accent sorry

00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:54,330
for for the presentation i would like to

00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:56,970
begin because I'm very I'm very engaging

00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,980
in free software movement for 11 years

00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:03,480
now but not only a job for me our

00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:06,210
passion and inform I for my part I have

00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:09,720
a few symbol in my life I we I don't

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:12,000
know if you heard this one but two week

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:18,180
ago you have an announcement from apple

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:21,390
apple to already now we use caviar we go

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:24,680
how vmware rs.60 in the u.s. kvm it's a

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:28,740
last Pope litera castell bath castell

00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:31,500
for today you know upon is a symbol for

00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:35,459
mini for richard stallman but for many

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,620
guides of the most proprietary ecosystem

00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,540
and i think we are we could be very

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,750
happy to have a symbol like that because

00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,910
today hubble choose free software it

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,489
shows open source to deploy their

00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:50,160
platform and what's important because i

00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:52,580
think like we said many years ago we are

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,580
going to win the wall and i think we are

00:02:52,580 --> 00:03:00,360
it's already done that's why it's

00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,220
important it's only my free soft an

00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,550
engagement or air but i think it's very

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:08,310
important and the vat you have OpenStack

00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:10,350
ok and what's important we are we made

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,320
the presentation I would like to have a

00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:16,380
global context I'm i was very happy to

00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:19,680
to to chair this morning a presentation

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:22,680
about OpenStack very cheap I take deep

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,140
technical presentation I would like to

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,140
have another way another symbol of

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,330
OpenStack i'm working with OpenStack for

00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,150
four years now ok before that i was

00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:36,450
arranged a manager and my first big

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:40,019
cloud project was a run with OpenStack

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,910
and I think to her to understand why

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,920
we're going to use more and more

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,019
OpenStack a why OpenStack it's a

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,200
district of innovation in the world of

00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:51,900
cloud of infrastructure you could keep

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,879
in mind the gardener all the time

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,920
you you are very service when you're

00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,970
talking about garden you know it's I

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,040
think it's very important for

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,500
presentation to our governor Governor

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,590
slide ok our that's why we are I think

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,629
you think now I'm very credential guys

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:10,739
because I have the slide of God now and

00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:13,980
that's important because today the world

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,199
when I talking with my clients we are

00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:19,680
true world in the same company in the

00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,989
big company it's a small not very we

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,479
don't have the same problem that we have

00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:26,880
the world to first worthy to mod one in

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:32,180
this word one you are traditional legacy

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:34,620
application with few evolution ERP CRM

00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:38,100
technology like that and we use year

00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:41,789
after year mo mo resources to provide

00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:44,910
the solution that you don't have you

00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:47,310
don't need to have a very high new

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:51,090
capabilities do not need up to create I

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:54,479
think new vm new content every day this

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,190
is a small it's it's it's very so

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,770
traditional way in the other way you

00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,840
have so much you it's the hostility and

00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:03,030
the agility it's why when you would like

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,800
to develop software when you would like

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,690
to develop new application where you are

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,659
on the web you know out you're on the

00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:12,389
smart phone company every company now

00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:14,940
developed software every company now the

00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:17,729
rough software for you new use you use

00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:20,940
on laptop you use on your new smartphone

00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:24,330
and advanced way as a traditional mode

00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:27,539
in infrastructure it's a vmware award I

00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:31,710
think with a virtualization world can

00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:35,159
not do the thing what we do we need to

00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:37,830
be fast we need to a one-day vm we need

00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:41,010
to go one however vm and it's a big

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:43,919
world of big company it's very hard but

00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:47,760
why why it is important to understand

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:50,490
that because this is not black or white

00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,639
you don't have OpenStack it's the best

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,800
solution ever and the virtualization

00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:59,310
like with VMware utilization is the bad

00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:02,279
one know you are two different shoes and

00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:04,590
you need you need to improve these shoes

00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,510
you need to keep

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,930
mind what we would like to do with your

00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:13,080
infrastructure that's why today when you

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:15,420
have a system like not to when you need

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,280
to have a big system only English of

00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,380
innovation you need to have continuous

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,410
integration you need to have tools to

00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,240
implement rapidly the new feature in

00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,760
your software or in your website and

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,120
that's why in this world we're going to

00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,890
talk about cloud computing okay in the

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,440
overworld you could talk about cloud

00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:36,840
computing but cloud computing have no

00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,630
advantage when an over solution in the

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,330
mode one it's a cost expensive solution

00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:48,540
I think it's a mode one cloud computing

00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:51,060
what's important the question is when

00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:54,060
this morning we are a definition of the

00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:58,670
clouds the definition in the Wikipedia

00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:02,040
another way I think today it's not I

00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:03,660
talk about industrial feedback and when

00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,800
I talk to my client when I see the

00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,810
company I think today we have two vision

00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:15,960
of the cloud we have the vision of the

00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:19,950
public cloud we I will go are we in turn

00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:22,650
oh it's over cider I will find you give

00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:24,420
you an example of what company offer

00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:27,270
this one and you have the vision of

00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,890
private cloud and private cloud what is

00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,660
the differences is not about the

00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:34,260
previous ships of formation where we

00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,880
like to it's also what's the power you

00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,950
have on your infrastructure what you

00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,570
would like to do with your data where we

00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,280
left too many do you have an invention

00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:44,190
on do you have a data center do you have

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,710
server how many several you have how

00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:48,810
many money you invest in your server all

00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:51,570
the question are important it's not so

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:55,380
easy to say clouds it is the future know

00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:57,720
it depend on watches exactly you your

00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,720
situation right now that's why it's

00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:04,740
important and in this world of public

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:07,590
cloud or private cloud you have two

00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:10,020
actors the first actor it's a public

00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,330
cloud actual today when you're talking

00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,250
about with every company with when we

00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:16,860
think about cloud computing we think

00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,580
about public cloud solution they never

00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,490
think of

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,770
out private cloud solution why because

00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,889
before OpenStack you don't have a

00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:29,550
private cloud solution you only have a

00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:31,889
virtualization solution now why because

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,320
when you're talking about private public

00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:37,019
cloud you have a WS I think it's a

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,019
leader of of the market you have a shoe

00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:43,110
from Microsoft you are over eh in Quebec

00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:45,450
it's the most larger data center in the

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,220
world and based on Quebec it's a

00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:51,570
traditional way you are software

00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:55,589
software it's as a the IRS in fact

00:08:51,570 --> 00:09:01,230
rather service offer from IBM in this

00:08:55,589 --> 00:09:03,779
way amazon I've been creating a new

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,820
paradigm of cloud a new problem of a

00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:09,269
fresh with you you need you in for us to

00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:11,010
do you take you in fata to not on vm you

00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:14,490
don't think them you don't fix server

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:16,890
you think resources we you think cpu are

00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,890
you you think our drive you think like

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,269
that and when you deploy an application

00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:23,430
you don't care about where my

00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:26,399
application where I put my application

00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:31,380
your question is how i could build an

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:33,839
application very with a capability to to

00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,940
scale with the demand of my application

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,269
that's why today when you like when you

00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,040
are netflix when you are we bear when

00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:44,399
you have company like that you go to HUD

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,250
WS because it's the only public cloud

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:52,170
over you elasticity over you all you

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:55,890
need to improve your infrastructure and

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:57,990
in that way you don't have the same

00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:00,029
thing in the private cloud because if

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,500
you built today if you built an

00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:05,610
application and improve that cloud you

00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:08,430
built you build it on the vm and vm it's

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:11,100
not undermine resources vm it's very

00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,769
focus resources and after that you could

00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,260
create a mekinese mature to deploy into

00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:20,850
to increase your banner is not the true

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:24,420
cloud that's why five years ago in NASA

00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:26,490
and Rackspace one of the company compete

00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,949
amazon would like to create a new

00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,260
solution a new tools to offer the same

00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:34,800
thing the sensitive approach of

00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:36,600
like how WS if this is OpenStack to

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,990
compare with the smartphone industry i

00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:44,820
could say ours and web services is the

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:50,280
iphone OpenStack its Android you know

00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:54,630
with eyes iphone the under iphone upper

00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:57,330
of it involved all the elements you have

00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,740
you on your iPhone okay it's in manage

00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:02,220
all the element you screen the

00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:04,140
technology or the CPU what what you

00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,820
would like to do with iphone it's very

00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:10,380
straight by its very straight by well by

00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:12,300
Apple in the other way when you think

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,430
about OpenStack you think about android

00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,620
android it's an open platform you could

00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,750
share everywhere with any other platform

00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,480
you could have some soon you could have

00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,730
LG you could have company use android is

00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,490
the same thing with OpenStack OpenStack

00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,890
it's a tool to manage and for us to try

00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:31,200
the service we are going to talk about

00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:33,870
what is infrastructure service in every

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,340
platform in every technology if I resume

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:41,820
like I will say OpenStack it's only a

00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:43,530
standard up a if you have a big

00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,360
conversation about technical side of

00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,820
OpenStack but you don't keep in mind

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,830
OpenStack heated standard solution for

00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,740
the cloud infrastructure you don't

00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:56,010
understand what is OpenStack is the only

00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,620
word up a standard up a we're going on

00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:02,160
that I would like this morning we say

00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:04,320
OpenStack it's a pass a solution Iran

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,150
many project with OpenStack OpenStack

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,800
it's not a bass of South solution

00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:10,080
OpenStack its infrastructure as a

00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,480
service solution after that you could

00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,610
you could have a stack on OpenStack to

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,800
automate processes to automate

00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:19,380
deployment and after that you could have

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,100
a pass a solution that you could also

00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:27,060
have a pass without yes you could have

00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:30,300
versus without us what exactly is open

00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:33,660
tag it opens up over virtualization a

00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,430
new infrastructure all the stack of your

00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:40,440
infras to arbitrage I think it's the

00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:43,880
most view of the every presentation

00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:47,610
about to pennsic finish with this

00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:50,370
this picture that I think why because we

00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:52,560
will be to resume very well what is

00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,779
exactly OpenStack it's a complete

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,000
virtualization of your data center you

00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:59,520
have you don't care about what is you

00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,650
hardware which is your switch what is

00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,900
your technology and the OpenStack you

00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:06,540
are focused only on how you could serve

00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:11,150
you application how you could serve to

00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:14,190
application what's the whip and the over

00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:16,380
the elements very important in OpenStack

00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:20,580
after battery we will have an example

00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:22,710
it's up actually since this morning we

00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,380
have a torque variant interesting talk

00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:28,020
about open source and free software I

00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:30,180
would like the two words both of the

00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:32,040
world both of the best of the free

00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:35,220
software world up in the open source

00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,830
world but you could give in this way if

00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:41,190
you have a listen Singh can commit it

00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:43,770
you know because you could up when you

00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:46,589
use apache why OpenStack it's so popular

00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:48,350
with with big company because we've

00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:51,120
hibachi licensing you could integrate

00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:53,310
hapa OpenStack in your prepaid

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,790
proprietary solution you could enter

00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:58,950
great in every technology you want you

00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,870
could offer upstream solution at

00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:03,330
OpenStack you could integrate OpenStack

00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:06,570
on cisco you could enter that OpenStack

00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:09,120
with MC with dell with HP you are danke

00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:11,730
because apache permits the communication

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,400
between proprietary software and open

00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:17,550
source software that's why today open

00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:21,570
tacit so popular because OpenStack offer

00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:24,780
at the industry for years ago and stand

00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:26,700
out and happy all the elements the

00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:30,480
component of OpenStack communicate with

00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:32,760
a happy like we like we'd said this

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,500
morning a paper need to have a standard

00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,970
communication between two component

00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,650
intended to have a standard

00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,839
communication between every technology

00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:42,000
you have around OpenStack hardware

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,490
technology software technology you are

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,300
only happy rest up early communication

00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:50,130
it's very simple and this is the new way

00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,440
of open source you could have mini

00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,960
software and after virtue of a standard

00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,920
PE and in the world of big wha

00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:01,940
it's above big company just keep in mind

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:09,150
VMware today VMware it's a dell company

00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:11,180
okay del sol by both the balls enc in

00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:16,020
the same time both vmware you know

00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:19,770
vmware it's Vance smaller than dell need

00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:22,590
to to above a big company like NC to

00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:24,210
both vmware and vmware it's ninety-five

00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:27,510
percent of the via transition of the

00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:30,630
world in this world the big world the

00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:33,540
company are they are very big with big

00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:35,520
money in this world you have the problem

00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,280
of hardware and the adword company are

00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,880
very strong and today that's why in the

00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:44,160
game of big player you need to have a

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,320
standard solution and OpenStack over

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,120
that a standard solution you could

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,890
compete on every technology you could

00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,050
compete an hour we're on software and

00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:55,260
vat vat you can't you clinic in the same

00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:57,170
way and that's why you when you are

00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:01,980
Cisco you don't want to depend off

00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:05,010
vmware from enc from dell you don't want

00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:07,620
to depend of a WS you would like to you

00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:09,420
up your own solution and you have to

00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:13,710
wait to do that the first way you create

00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:16,650
the first cloud technology solution like

00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:20,130
we we did like you will get in I think

00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:22,200
you should did you should many years ago

00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:25,350
or the nuvi away is an open innovation

00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,930
way the open vision way you create a

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:30,690
consortium to create that and the best

00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:33,690
way to make reception across ocean in a

00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:37,490
in this year it's open source licensing

00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:40,410
it says Lesley when you are you don't

00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:42,240
you that you don't care about all the

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,980
lessons inside you don't care about how

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,350
we could create value you don't make a

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:49,140
big consortium are codes you don't have

00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:50,790
to what many many documentaries to say

00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,920
how we could work together know you have

00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:55,440
an open source licensing and after that

00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,720
you work on you don't work with with

00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,810
that and I think that's why open source

00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,350
today is the best way to innovate in the

00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:07,850
best way to create new value in

00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:13,130
for industry in IT industry I'm sure

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:16,550
you're right with me know okay a just in

00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:20,390
this mind okay OpenStack or first and

00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:23,000
data pay with viscera with this reality

00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:25,850
we could create all you would like to

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,100
create with cloud technology uu KU job

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,560
private cloud solution you could undead

00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,420
a part of you infrastructure and private

00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,550
cloud on public cloud you could create a

00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,680
communication between you provide cloud

00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:39,920
you public cloud this is a bit cloud you

00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:42,950
could burst I think you have affronted

00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,530
on few application like open EDX and you

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:48,850
would like to create a new you have I

00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:52,460
think you just recruit the big one of

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:54,470
the professor of mathematics and after

00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,900
the first course online on your decks

00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:59,660
platform I think 1 million person come

00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,580
to your platform okay that's not a

00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,200
problem you could create you could

00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,810
deploy your platform internally and

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,840
after burst it externally if what's

00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:11,000
possible and that's what would today

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:14,780
OpenStack it's very creative is

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,700
important you you have technology but

00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:19,640
you have also stunned that you have as a

00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:23,150
new parent of strategy for many company

00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:26,900
and I think OpenStack opened the mind

00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:29,000
opens opportunity for many company 2222

00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:31,310
opened rizzuto today we work with IBM

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,100
with OpenStack with Microsoft Azure with

00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:37,250
OpenStack with OVH I think we have many

00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:41,690
many solution with that because tando

00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:43,520
uppy I assisted it's very important when

00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:47,960
we talk about free software we talk

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:50,090
about ecosystem two years ago I met a

00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,360
presentation at liberal liberal planet

00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:56,210
in in Boston about why OpenStack nurse

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,150
be a free software and what's an

00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:02,480
introduction of that today OpenStack

00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:06,050
like the guys this morning it's a most

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,180
dynamic first project ever seen you know

00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:11,650
this is a contribution of OpenStack at

00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:14,030
the beginning of stack oolitic the truth

00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,070
give you the information about the

00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:17,190
statistic of OpenStack you could see in

00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:24,150
July

00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:27,810
the number of of commit and now this is

00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:31,470
very very very a large-scale you I don't

00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:36,840
know you when I began the openstack I

00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:38,430
was in December 11 and today business

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,400
not the same industry this is not the

00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:43,650
same technology ah so for years ago you

00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,410
know and that's very important because

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:49,590
this is the most impressive open source

00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:53,400
below we will never seen okay but all

00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:56,190
that other price you can grow so fast

00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:59,160
and as a desk or ever the most able I

00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:01,380
could you ever have that's important to

00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,980
say that that the open source is not

00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:07,500
magical it's not it's not magic it's not

00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,360
magic it's real that's why and in the

00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,000
other way in OpenStack you are the six

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,850
months real is every 61 you have a new

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,130
release of OpenStack and thus but very

00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:20,070
difficult while you would like to to to

00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:25,290
to push OpenStack in prediction to to to

00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:27,720
to keep this this one that's why at the

00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:29,700
departure of OpenStack project the

00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,480
foundation will discuss about that

00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,610
create very very quickly or processes to

00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,590
improve OpenStack component to approve

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:44,100
new comp ananta to integrate this

00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:46,170
component OpenStack it's a very very big

00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:49,710
symbol of what we can do to create a

00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:52,500
very high level code release high-level

00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:55,260
code implementation and that's very hard

00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:59,220
because I think this year OpenStack is

00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:01,800
the most its most it's a bigger

00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,440
investment project on development you

00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,690
know I know one another project in one

00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,970
year create so so many committed so many

00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:11,010
code that's important that's why you

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:13,230
need to have an incumbent process you

00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:15,000
need to have and that's important

00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:19,080
because in the same time you have a very

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:23,730
very competitive markets around the pin

00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:26,730
stack we're going in the over way I I

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:29,550
discussed with my guys one year two

00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,179
years ago when I when I began at sub off

00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,490
a linux

00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:36,029
come from France in France are we have

00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:38,129
big open stat project and I was in some

00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:41,879
of our Linux ok some of the minions it's

00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:43,919
a 16 year old company we've some of our

00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:46,320
Linux you know it's a specialist it's

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,159
open source leader what what can end the

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:53,429
first time I discuss with the guys my

00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:56,039
team i leveled our skill level guys from

00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:58,889
linux the new line is very well blue

00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:02,850
madness is important very well but after

00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:05,820
I I demonstrate watches OpenStack i ah

00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:09,330
it's very you are you will you have a

00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:12,899
silence in the room you know in because

00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:15,779
they never seen a complex project like

00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:18,899
OpenStack I think today you could say

00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:22,110
open sockets more complex van linux

00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:24,389
because why because you under the linux

00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:27,019
in OpenStack you also embedded the soft

00:22:24,389 --> 00:22:30,119
also virtualization and network with it

00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:32,669
virtualization you integrate the ipod

00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:35,610
visa you integrate many many things it

00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:39,480
many many competent that but important

00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:41,399
because today when my client or guys say

00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,009
i would like to try OpenStack I go

00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:47,519
upstream ok you could go and stream that

00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:49,529
don't be afraid ah it's the same thing

00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:52,860
is the first time you push good newly

00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:54,749
nukes you say ok I begin to a true to

00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,820
scissor cut offline weeks before i would

00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:59,730
like to push to deploy linux you know

00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:02,279
you in the first time you deploy linux

00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:04,769
and after that you could see the code

00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:07,080
you could package linux but the first

00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:09,869
time you need to to to create but

00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:13,860
important because i think many company

00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:17,759
may try to deploy OpenStack you have a

00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:20,059
deception on that because this is a i

00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:22,559
think a hard project to understand and

00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:26,879
after that we could see we are very a

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:29,610
specialist on OpenStack with this

00:23:26,879 --> 00:23:33,119
problem a huge program project very

00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:37,590
complex very very and we have a big big

00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:41,220
fast grow the create a foundation was

00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:43,260
created to year for three years ago four

00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:46,560
years ago to support

00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:48,630
openstack movement just to give you an

00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,880
input the annual budget of the

00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:54,180
foundation of OpenStack foundation it's

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:57,000
Dean 10 million dollar budget area it's

00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,950
just to keep in mind what is the there

00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,650
is a movement of open tag you have a

00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:06,630
nonprofit organization focused only to

00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:09,990
manage how how coordinate all the stuff

00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:12,000
or an open Starkey this is a very budget

00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,680
but that's important and you are free

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,450
committee like we said this morning I

00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,980
don't create this is the same picture

00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:19,980
you could see on every presentation

00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:24,360
about OpenStack that's very interesting

00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:26,520
because in the on the left side you have

00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,590
the technical committee its elected by

00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,480
technical guys issue if you don't

00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:32,970
contribute to OpenStack you cannot vote

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:36,600
for these guys okay you need to push

00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:38,430
code 22 to nominate this guy and you can

00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,700
be to attend at this place if you did

00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:44,460
not commit code this is the best could

00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,560
be here only in the over way you have

00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:51,690
the user committee it's too contra

00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:55,130
balance the middle if this is all the

00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:58,020
user you have on OpenStack it could be i

00:24:55,130 --> 00:25:02,550
think i am one of Venna but will you do

00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:05,730
Oliver this morning I see 40 32,000

00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:08,520
people individual member of the

00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:10,980
foundation and this important you have

00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:14,610
the board objector it's when you have

00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:16,860
cash you are here when you are cisco

00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:19,350
when you are IBM when you are you would

00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:21,560
like to be here this is a war game in

00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:25,890
this place you know this is a technical

00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:28,410
all the technical issue our decide in

00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:32,310
tech committees but all the business

00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:34,620
issue are check here in the board of

00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:37,020
director and if that's important to

00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:39,360
understand today is the war the war is

00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:42,030
now about OpenStack because the market

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:45,030
is huge he grew very fast and you have

00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:48,180
big player in place and that's important

00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:50,310
you have a true political mindset in in

00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:52,800
the board today but if you like to

00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:54,570
contribute you don't care about that you

00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,419
don't care about the political aspect

00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,889
you are focused on your code

00:25:56,419 --> 00:26:00,019
you are focused on what you would like

00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:02,539
to do that's why we are trying to

00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:04,519
contribute to OpenStack that's why small

00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:05,869
company I have many friends it's a work

00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:09,830
in the small company you could

00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:15,440
contribute an OpenStack India overweight

00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:20,559
our inet a PhD about open source and

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:23,749
that's why I like to present this just

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:27,139
with this presentation this picture it's

00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:28,759
this is a true business oriented

00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:31,940
software when you talked this morning

00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:34,460
about open source freedom free software

00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:37,100
when you talk about OpenStack you don't

00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,749
talk about freedom you talk about open

00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,909
source you talk about business you do

00:26:38,749 --> 00:26:44,989
talked about leadership on the industry

00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:47,149
okay today you have many actual we

00:26:44,989 --> 00:26:48,919
discuss about what because that's the

00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:51,080
introduction as the Canadian market you

00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:52,700
know after that you could see what what

00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,249
we could have in the Canadian market you

00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,259
are watching provider they use OpenStack

00:26:55,249 --> 00:26:59,359
they are so big user OpenStack they push

00:26:57,259 --> 00:27:01,519
OpenStack at the maximum of a

00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:03,950
possibilities where are the creative

00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,149
janu open stark like a nervous this

00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:07,220
morning the network portion

00:27:05,149 --> 00:27:11,119
virtualization also stuff around open

00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:13,039
tag you have edit all reddit reddit is

00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:15,259
one of the most contribute most

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:18,850
important contributor trail at OpenStack

00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:22,009
you are service provider like I

00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:23,539
difference like a small one like

00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:25,999
sorrowfully nukes you a global service

00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:28,519
provider you could have in the in that

00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:31,519
way we could you have high BM you have

00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:33,409
oracle you have company have very very a

00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:36,409
lot of technology and you like to

00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:39,679
integrate OpenStack in the in the middle

00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:41,899
of the difference aquifer and you have

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,419
and use organization within a news

00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:48,769
organization it's today we have an

00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:52,730
example it's a Walmart people today you

00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:54,230
have NSA the NSA use OpenStack but

00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:58,669
strange know they use of control

00:27:54,230 --> 00:28:04,190
software because we were afraid to to to

00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:07,220
be spayed I think and NSA use OpenStack

00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:08,240
many many university you have also all

00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:11,150
the

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:15,260
company use all the gaming company or

00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:17,179
the company work on the web use open

00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:20,210
stark because this is a very serious

00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:23,510
case of a pen stack the torrent use

00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:26,270
scales on OpenStack it's also a hosting

00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:30,110
provider and gaming company video

00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:34,790
company Disney studio Disney Interactive

00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:38,059
is based on OpenStack BMW the BMW use

00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:40,070
OpenStack you have mini solution in this

00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:46,250
business oriented software it's

00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:48,650
important to you are but not easy world

00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:51,710
you have company contribute OpenStack

00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:53,690
misses an official information you go on

00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:56,750
stack elite tix tackle it ticks it's the

00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:58,880
the tools permit you have all the

00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:01,670
information what about statistical

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,300
information on OpenStack you could see

00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:07,640
every contribution at every choice

00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:11,330
component of OpenStack here and you

00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:14,390
could see this is a meritocracy aspect

00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:16,580
you will be the best on OpenStack you

00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:18,950
need to show what we do with OpenStack

00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:21,260
what you commit the first committee for

00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:24,110
OpenStack is read out after Ashley

00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:27,050
Rackspace mirantis IBM new mule is not

00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:31,910
the small one a but strange the latest

00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:34,730
it's vmware vmware it's one of the most

00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:37,340
big contributor of OpenStack that's why

00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:39,410
when i began i say you you are not in

00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:42,440
the same paradigm we are on the new way

00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:46,010
of the cloud even vmware nova event

00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:49,340
vmware say my technology its hold I need

00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:52,100
to improve improve it and I need to

00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:54,890
build on OpenStack on vmware to offer a

00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:58,850
new opportunity when you r dt high today

00:29:54,890 --> 00:30:00,980
the reality is you guysyou development

00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:05,330
guys who like one vm to create a new

00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:08,630
software only one vm this way n you you

00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:10,490
need to wait one week in the better way

00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:15,320
in the big organization to add this way

00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:21,410
vm one week ok after severe idea to do

00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:22,090
that clock knock on the door asher WS

00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:24,850
and say

00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:28,390
oh don't care about that i give a vm in

00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:30,970
10 minutes after one years after one

00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:33,760
year's that is the name we name that's a

00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:38,559
shadow Aichi you have a big shadow Aichi

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:40,960
and urgg I do you just so you have a big

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:44,409
part of your project and un francais to

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,049
outside you company a to go against what

00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:50,080
you need to reintroduce a solution in

00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:52,120
your company and VMware don't have all

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,250
to do that then we're don't have the

00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:56,890
technology to do but that's why you push

00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:59,380
firmware to say take back this solution

00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:01,779
and when we say okay we build OpenStack

00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:05,080
on VMware and your first sem services

00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:09,070
van as your uh WS and private cloud and

00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:11,320
after that we offer also a bursting in

00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,240
jail for Intel because in tell you

00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:18,149
contribute at every open source software

00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:21,070
I think any time I would like to have to

00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:23,890
to be sure all the technology could

00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:29,320
could be push on our own Intel I think

00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:31,840
today in this vision we are big market a

00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:34,990
huge market in the u.s. you have a huge

00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:38,950
market in Europe big big market in

00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:41,200
Europe and and after that when I met by

00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:45,309
first client about OpenStack two years

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:48,309
ago they said okay walnut yeah hundred

00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:52,240
thousand server it's enough that's okay

00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:55,539
i have the name of big company very very

00:31:52,240 --> 00:32:00,159
impressive that would do it in quebec

00:31:55,539 --> 00:32:02,200
and what would do it in canada and

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,360
that's a strange question you know the

00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,120
war did not stop as a function of Canada

00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:09,580
you know but I understand that the

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,340
question is what is the ecosystem I

00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:16,000
could reach if i push on OpenStack

00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:17,799
rochette if I don't want to be alone on

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,929
the project I don't want to be alone to

00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:21,549
deploy but I don't want to be alone to

00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:23,440
contribute on that and don't want to i

00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:25,299
would like to create a community an

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,029
ecosystem that's why i say at the

00:32:25,299 --> 00:32:29,799
beginning free software eagle ecosystem

00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:33,490
if you don't have a cool system it's

00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:35,640
very hard that's why it's important to

00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:38,580
introduce to can adjourn

00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:41,850
actor in this in this market how you

00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:44,790
could work with a company true to build

00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:46,110
on OpenStack you have the editor and

00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:50,180
technology provider you have the

00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:54,780
traditional editor HP IBM Cisco reddits

00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:57,810
this is a worldwide class company I

00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:59,580
think we are very active in in Canada

00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:02,190
and you could use their technology to

00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,520
push OpenStack you are a new one it's a

00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:07,980
very interesting it's a Toronto company

00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:12,120
it's a breakwater it's hard to say that

00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:16,140
the first french guy breakwater this is

00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:21,570
the name breakwater it's a toronto-based

00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:24,540
company offer on a bundle of OpenStack

00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:27,150
easy to deploy to come to complete with

00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:30,000
VMware so VMware solution you are you

00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:33,810
don't want to use VMware to to build a

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,420
linux server it's a web to use BM 1 to 2

00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:38,490
ampere run linux to deploy linux but

00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:41,040
mini company use vmware to do that and

00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:43,770
that's great way to offer you a bundle

00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:46,260
of OpenStack OpenStack distribution to

00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:52,680
go more easy with all the ad well you

00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:55,620
need on that Cisco for you switch all

00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:58,590
the server you need to build an

00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:00,720
OpenStack IBM is the same way that's

00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:05,400
very strange because you have IBM in the

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:09,240
2 colon the first quran is IBM if you

00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:13,350
use IBM cloud solution you use OpenStack

00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:17,610
but IBM is I think it's today the

00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:20,490
company I've been contributing at I've

00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:22,470
been contributing the most it's a most

00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:25,200
of it important contributor of open

00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:27,780
source IBM truly if you saw every

00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,300
project you have IBM and 20 years ago

00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:34,590
you have IBM and VAT support on that's

00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:37,320
the way I all the time IBM don't want to

00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:40,770
say at these clients a we use open

00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:44,399
source no we change the name Cloudy Bay

00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:46,440
management platform ok and you are no

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,750
idea what is you enter your part for two

00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,090
days you deploy cloud IBM management

00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:53,700
form you use OpenStack see you you

00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:56,250
deploy / we see you use OpenStack see

00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:58,650
you if you're going choose a soft layer

00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:01,590
it's as a yes solution public cloud

00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:05,490
solution of OpenStack of IBM you use

00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:07,470
OpenStack but you don't say you don't

00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:10,980
say you use a pen tank that's why it's

00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:14,460
very important Envy in this colon you

00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:16,830
have the Austin provider like I see you

00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,810
or simple Roger play a big game with

00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:22,190
OpenStack because OpenStack offerors

00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:24,960
opportunity to be competitive with a WS

00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:28,230
that's important because that the game

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,480
today in you are telco you have the same

00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:33,960
problem today I don't mention that here

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,180
because they'll work on that you have to

00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,940
lose you have a Roger of a project on

00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:43,110
that progress concept but Roger today

00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:45,570
the offer ovh ericsson deploy all the

00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:48,360
all the exhalation cloud are based on

00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:51,840
openstack cloud ops it's a small company

00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:56,640
in montreal claude ades company in

00:35:51,840 --> 00:36:01,320
ontario hi web it's a company just two

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:04,170
years ago was valspar by inch a nap 28

00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,780
data center women aged 28 data center

00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:09,030
with OpenStack or me codes it's

00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,420
accompanied the same it's a hosting

00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:16,160
provider based in montreal ever offer

00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:18,900
OpenStack in we all we also leash on you

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:21,330
but not important we use OpenStack or

00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:25,440
not that's important to you they offer

00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:30,240
you infrastructure-as-a-service solution

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:32,790
ng last side I'm looking for an over

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,670
OpenStack service provider but I I don't

00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:38,550
fight them there's a very strange but I

00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:42,900
think if you your church on Google you

00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:45,840
could find another OpenStack service

00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,880
provider I think today we have OpenStack

00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,430
ship in sub off a linux and we are a

00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:53,610
true OpenStack integrator because we

00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:56,460
don't want to stay to stay in your new

00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:59,550
company two or three years we know we

00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,860
are not a big service provider like many

00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,789
we just would like to push you up and

00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,309
start to

00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:07,289
to learn you how you could build an

00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:10,979
OpenStack and after you could go out

00:37:07,289 --> 00:37:13,229
with with you version of OpenStack we

00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:17,489
are a partner we've read that for most

00:37:13,229 --> 00:37:19,650
of all project the user because what's

00:37:17,489 --> 00:37:22,429
important and i just added this one

00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:27,269
Seneca College very happy this morning

00:37:22,429 --> 00:37:29,849
and I fink TD Bank today dunk add an

00:37:27,269 --> 00:37:32,039
announcement at the last open stacks

00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:36,660
image in Vancouver today long queues

00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:38,999
OpenStack dunk user of open source

00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:42,539
software this morning we have a question

00:37:38,999 --> 00:37:44,369
about security what is what is the

00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:46,859
question the bank use open source

00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:48,839
software yeah eh that's we have good

00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:51,869
reason because when you use open source

00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:54,449
software you use a security tools but

00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:58,049
what if you need to keep in mind because

00:37:54,449 --> 00:37:59,999
many years ago the proprietary company

00:37:58,049 --> 00:38:03,390
said open source is not check your I

00:37:59,999 --> 00:38:05,759
think the inverse the situation in opens

00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:08,969
open shortest shake you when you use a

00:38:05,759 --> 00:38:11,039
proprietary solution you you don't be

00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:15,479
sure you can't be sure this is a shaker

00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:17,759
solution to debunk a deploy and today we

00:38:15,479 --> 00:38:23,069
work I have an example we work with

00:38:17,759 --> 00:38:26,130
Quebec ministry on OpenStack the secret

00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:35,880
services of Canada deploy OpenStack like

00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:40,339
NSA in in in the US UK Wickham Concordia

00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:43,589
the to the to the first the both of

00:38:40,339 --> 00:38:45,809
research share about OpenStack so first

00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:49,380
what you can work on OpenStack at eight

00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:52,849
walking the sub 11 work about OpenStack

00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:56,219
and security access konkan ja have a big

00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:59,849
contract orinda contract with Ericsson

00:38:56,219 --> 00:39:02,999
and you come up I think a big community

00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:06,839
of OpenStack ER in in you come and we

00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:11,130
work specifically on the SDN and this

00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:12,869
side but very interesting because if you

00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:15,510
would like more technical information of

00:39:12,869 --> 00:39:17,910
OpenStack we could take many time on

00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:19,740
but with pleasure I could give you all

00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:21,420
the technical information and the

00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,940
openstack but you could have many

00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:26,630
opportunities researcher for R&D project

00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:29,460
with OpenStack because we touch every

00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:31,530
problematic with infrastructure network

00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:35,340
virtualization and Clement ation

00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:36,780
container security access automation

00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:40,230
continuous integration I think we have

00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:44,030
many many opportunity we have projecting

00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:48,330
taluks to and we've opened index like

00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:51,090
the presentation we are just before and

00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:54,120
we be soft is one of the big user of

00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:57,360
OpenStack today data ballot is a small

00:39:54,120 --> 00:40:00,600
company and mini start up two days ago I

00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:03,990
discuss with a mark who Toronto ejector

00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:06,630
I met you guys from a very beautiful

00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:09,120
project but started very continuous

00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:11,660
integration get carried all the open

00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:14,460
source tools and after a few description

00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:16,650
they use OpenStack they use a pencil

00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:19,140
from rackspace but we use OpenStack

00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:20,880
because when you start up you start with

00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:23,570
nothing and when you start with nothing

00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,740
is a better way to two of the bests a

00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:28,530
descriptive solution you use open source

00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:32,670
you use or open source OpenStack appeal

00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:34,500
and after that you after you create you

00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:36,470
are p you create your application with

00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:39,240
OpenStack you could deploy everywhere

00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:42,120
okay after that we you have another

00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,760
opportunity that's why first the example

00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:47,700
itself we have example of OpenStack

00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,710
project we rented a as a first it's a

00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,540
learning university I think you have

00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:53,580
already have a will great presentation

00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:55,740
about all the eggs on OpenStack how we

00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:57,780
could build a bursting and private cloud

00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:59,640
public cloud solution that's important

00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:02,660
because in university you have you have

00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:04,770
a huge infrastructure why you could use

00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:07,770
dribbly cloud when you already have

00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:10,770
investment on server that's very

00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:14,790
important to job at it you have also

00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:17,790
also privacy also elements run 3 x ZN

00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:19,470
contents contently sensing because when

00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:24,300
you are professor you don't want to

00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:26,700
other free free use of you can tons you

00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:29,119
could have I think listen single new on

00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:31,859
your content that's possible

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,710
for Quebec ministry we were happy we

00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:36,720
deploy an OpenStack reddit OpenStack to

00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:42,690
deploy all the java application and the

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:45,540
website we in this in this case we don't

00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:47,099
have the transition we have the

00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:50,869
abominator server they would like to

00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:54,990
virtualize where a user suse linux and

00:41:50,869 --> 00:41:59,119
after discussion we send me what is the

00:41:54,990 --> 00:42:01,800
virtualization in 2015 I say

00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,160
virtualization this year it's open Zac

00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:08,010
if you will med med virtualization with

00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:10,319
proxmox Oviatt you have very true open

00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:13,140
source the transition model you would

00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:15,869
like with them where you are you go into

00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:17,640
the trolleys virtualization made the

00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:20,420
transition with the whole solution

00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:23,099
today's a new solution is OpenStack and

00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:26,069
after we have a very innovative company

00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:29,369
we offer a wireless in also two motrins

00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:33,359
and we've wireless we offer also element

00:42:29,369 --> 00:42:36,240
of information about what can what the

00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:39,359
client do with access what can do in the

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,700
ultimate earn enough after you you

00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:44,369
create a content you create offer with

00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:47,490
the information you take with the client

00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:50,730
we are three different project we go we

00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:55,200
are now our number one dots with we

00:42:50,730 --> 00:43:00,329
can't talking about an example we are

00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:03,060
just see before for open EDX just an

00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:06,450
example of OpenStack deployment you have

00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:08,490
continuous integration tools and after

00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:12,180
you deploy it on OpenStack and you could

00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:14,480
create every vm you would like to create

00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:18,030
with you will contain a review

00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,450
application and we could burst on a

00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:23,250
public cloud if you don't have enough

00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:29,510
resources on your server that's

00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:29,510
important because advice

00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:39,990
because when you it's important you are

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:44,040
investment you have server you have

00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:45,900
content you have also hardware when you

00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:48,690
would like to go to the cloud you don't

00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:51,390
cross all of that you don't take all of

00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:54,090
that into trash you could use that and

00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:56,100
you could use as a better way with that

00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:58,320
and after that to have a reflection of

00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:00,780
what what we will have to build in the

00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,700
future it's a public or private cloud if

00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:08,330
you have a project like that it's very

00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:14,250
important we poppin stack keep it simple

00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:17,610
jus simple I so we do but important too

00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:21,030
good with OpenStack of the most simple

00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:23,910
way but important and more you are a

00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:26,250
simple deployment on OpenStack more you

00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:30,390
will less you will have problem with

00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:32,850
that less you will have you you will

00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:34,920
meet many difficulties but very

00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:39,750
important you could get upstream

00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:42,600
solution I prefer to you I'm upstream

00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:45,840
guys form anything but i prefer said to

00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:50,460
you know i think it's in invest time it

00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:52,230
more important to use a solution promote

00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,780
by an editor I think that because to

00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:58,380
deserve solution is very hard and the

00:44:54,780 --> 00:45:00,990
most difficult difficulty way with

00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,980
OpenStack it the deployment tool when

00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:04,920
you would like to deploy into

00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,630
maintaining to upgrade OpenStack every

00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,180
six months or every year you need to

00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:11,070
have an Orchestrator all you need to

00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:15,180
have an automation tool that's very

00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:19,020
important but why are we about you do it

00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:21,840
simple don't talk about nav lgnore that

00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:24,530
weight today just run very simply after

00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:27,090
that you could upgrade your technology

00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:29,370
in your lookin window when you choose

00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:34,290
your OpenStack platform you need to

00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:37,020
verify you are p is not folk but the

00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:40,359
upstream up a unit you need to be sure

00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:43,180
you not you not have a low key

00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:45,640
under you OpenStack that's important

00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:48,759
because OpenStack offer you freedom

00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:53,170
freedom to choose hardware feed on to

00:45:48,759 --> 00:45:55,989
deploy software but if you going to lock

00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:58,210
your OpenStack with a vendor it's Apache

00:45:55,989 --> 00:46:02,859
project everyone there could do

00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:05,289
everything with OpenStack even you rock

00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:07,539
you your OpenStack but very important

00:46:05,289 --> 00:46:09,970
because today more company would like to

00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:12,819
go to with OpenStack for the freedom

00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:15,640
because we don't want look in they want

00:46:12,819 --> 00:46:18,369
a new vision I we've only had that value

00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:21,579
solution and not looking but important

00:46:18,369 --> 00:46:25,690
when you choose your OpenStack and after

00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:28,150
you have also rated technology today if

00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:31,779
you don't know doctor I think you need

00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:34,529
to know now you did you need to to take

00:46:31,779 --> 00:46:37,720
a note with docker because docker is a

00:46:34,529 --> 00:46:40,599
when I say OpenStack it's a yes solution

00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:42,789
okay when you build a platform as a

00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:44,890
service you would like to deploy is the

00:46:42,789 --> 00:46:47,589
automation you need to have tools like

00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:50,890
the petÃ©n chaff its automation tools

00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:55,749
they permit to create a new vm after

00:46:50,890 --> 00:47:01,710
OpenStack create a new vm pipettes right

00:46:55,749 --> 00:47:07,809
now you could have you have you have I

00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:12,549
know reset or set you have recipes about

00:47:07,809 --> 00:47:15,220
how you could automatic recipes this VM

00:47:12,549 --> 00:47:18,489
it's van with line lyrics with Drupal

00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:21,460
with lamp and you could automatically

00:47:18,489 --> 00:47:24,549
create you vm automatically install

00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:28,920
software on your vm autocad identify you

00:47:24,549 --> 00:47:32,259
vm with you active directory of you you

00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:34,720
you choose your identity tools ldap

00:47:32,259 --> 00:47:37,329
tools you could also create the gmail

00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,700
user interaction between the vm you save

00:47:37,329 --> 00:47:42,369
this vm it's other private network with

00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:44,410
another vm or another container but very

00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:46,989
important put that today we run a big

00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:49,150
project with a pet for data there's a

00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:53,060
damn bank and we have big big project

00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:58,520
with cn and we help also

00:47:53,060 --> 00:48:00,860
and to burn burn on that today reddit

00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:03,830
embedded the pipette on the satellite

00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:08,270
solution the automation solution you

00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:13,100
have also to new way Google two months

00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:17,570
ago I drain as drain OpenStack

00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:19,550
foundation okay to push cubanita scuba

00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:22,220
little sister i'm not just special list

00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:24,920
of communities okay it's a great

00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:27,100
challenge to be to understand OpenStack

00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:30,500
and I content just establishing and

00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:33,800
terminated it's a container a platform

00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:35,720
you could build a container and you

00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:41,180
could build many container on that in

00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:46,520
container like docker permit to be more

00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:49,820
less dependent van you OS less dependent

00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:51,710
value linux container undead only the

00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:54,530
part you need for your application to

00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:57,350
deploy it if your application need only

00:48:54,530 --> 00:49:00,110
a lamp stack who you are don't care

00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:02,300
about the interface that all the stuff

00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:04,250
you have an operating system we when you

00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:06,110
deploy operating system with linux you

00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:09,830
have miniatures you don't need if you

00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:13,040
like to to deploy a PHP solution with

00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:16,070
continue our focus only on the odd what

00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:19,700
you eat in the operating system it is

00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:21,980
very creative new tools and very very

00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:25,610
popular and with cuban a test and docker

00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:28,640
and OpenStack you are very free to

00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:32,960
deploy everywhere in the same time you

00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:35,630
have a new project I we have project

00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:38,210
with dhoka dhoka with a GD bank we have

00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:41,540
to debunk you to integrate duker we have

00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:44,540
many clients startup or development

00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:47,350
company work with dr. we help them but

00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:52,130
after we have the new project missiles

00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:54,050
um if one of you know missiles I think

00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:57,750
you are even through to to discuss it

00:49:54,050 --> 00:50:01,610
because I don't want to to see you

00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:05,580
force Oh force information but it's very

00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:07,650
Apache project Apache foundation to have

00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:10,020
a of you use of sure all the

00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:16,080
hardware aspect in your continent today

00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:19,920
mezzos is used by apple with kvm to

00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:21,750
deploy also a state of iphone where this

00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,090
is an interface between the hard way of

00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:27,720
life on the application and all the

00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:29,880
virtualization to a dull the next iphone

00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:33,330
will be with your transition with kvm

00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:37,650
you know that but important because also

00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:40,970
on the world or the smartphone instead

00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:44,160
to use open source solution instead of

00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:49,640
Windows Phone but no one other who is

00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:53,720
this one swing okay and just I still

00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:58,740
tasted in English in French

00:50:53,720 --> 00:51:00,960
recycling you already have what you need

00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:03,810
you already app server your Jade you

00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,610
have kvm you already have the component

00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:07,860
open source component sure they all did

00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:10,950
you have what you like what you need to

00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:13,080
deploy OpenStack you would like if you

00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:15,360
have keep in mind if you would like to

00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:16,980
run open cycle Jets it's not a big

00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:19,560
investment in the beginning you could

00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:23,130
run it in the you are your current

00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:28,680
architecture you could but but not a big

00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:31,130
project I think it's important finish if

00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,130
