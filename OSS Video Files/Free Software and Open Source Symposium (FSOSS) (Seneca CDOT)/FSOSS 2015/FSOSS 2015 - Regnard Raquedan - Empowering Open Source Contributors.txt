if somebody tell something TMI so yeah

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,670
so it's good so it's very fun it seems

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,049
like everybody's smiling and had a good

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,529
I'm sure everybody had a good

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:20,310
introduction I'd be happy who has the

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:25,650
armpits with the pink tutus anybody here

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:29,910
nope okay cool alright so i just want to

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,619
share my own engagement story in my

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,300
story in mozilla so i'm gonna share this

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:40,320
photo so this was taken in china around

00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:42,690
2010 and when I it was really for it was

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,399
I was on vacation and I knew that we

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,570
were going to the Great Wall of China so

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:52,789
it's a very massive massive location and

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:55,980
and I was there I Spit I specifically

00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:58,500
made sure I had brought my mozilla

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,039
t-shirt so this is not the same shirt

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,420
obviously but but may I made sure that I

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,400
brought my massage shirt because I

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,760
wanted to make sure that i would take a

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,180
photo on the Great Wall of China doing

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,100
something weird or funny or whatever so

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:19,350
at the spur of the moment I asked my

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:21,030
then I my my wife she say hey just take

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,990
photo of me I'm just into a kung-fu kick

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,820
and she did so I share this and I didn't

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,790
share it on my social personal social

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,119
network I shared it in our community

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:37,920
blog and this at that time during that

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:40,470
year this became one of the more more

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,680
shared in popular photos in in our

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:46,920
Mozilla community blog so think about

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,840
that for a second so there was on my

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,399
personal trip but I wanted to make sure

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,799
I did something for the community so if

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,439
there's if you could if you have that in

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,079
your own sort open source project like

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,329
people on their own time think about

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:09,360
your open source project in that way

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:12,330
would that be great so in my my story I

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,590
actually started contributing to Mozilla

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,739
when I was still in the Phillippe

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,180
and fast forward to six years now I'm

00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,840
still doing the same thing here in

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:24,720
Toronto so as you can see it how did

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,220
that happen how did a person doing

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,530
something from other side of the globe

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,769
move to a new city and still keep doing

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,930
that so there has to be something in the

00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:36,780
way it's set up that makes it possible

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:41,310
and make people have people thrive in

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:44,190
that situation so that's what this talk

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,410
is going to be about so from my personal

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:50,780
experiences and how I've been doing this

00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:54,480
with Mozilla reps and Mozilla community

00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:56,519
so I've been speaking about Mozilla so

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,129
this is the Mozilla room apparently in

00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:03,720
this event and I'm sure everybody here

00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:06,900
has heard of Mozilla yes anybody who

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,959
hasn't heard of Mozilla I'd be I'm gonna

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:13,500
go out of this roof you haven't ok so

00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,209
Mozilla yes so let's do another co

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,590
activity because I want to test because

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:20,850
since everybody here is a techie person

00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,639
an open-source person I just want to

00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,170
test and it's by a quick name of Mozilla

00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,840
bingo so I'm going to give you one

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,730
minute I hope everybody has a small

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,540
piece of paper I'm going to give you one

00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:35,970
minute to write as much terms or

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,310
keywords if you think about Mozilla and

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:42,450
then i'm going to show you a grid later

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,630
and a person who can make a pattern from

00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,650
that grid will receive a special prize

00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,780
all right so i'm going to give you a one

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:52,380
minute let's write anything you know

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,720
about Mozilla like one word keywords or

00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:58,290
phrases that you think about Mozilla and

00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,780
a good example would be Firefox so we're

00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:04,560
going to write write it down or you say

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,239
something about browser just write it

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,590
down give you a minute I'll give you one

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,910
minute to do that and then i'm going to

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:14,220
show you the grid after and if somebody

00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:20,130
creates aa because it's a four by four

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:22,940
grid so anybody who creates for of the

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,560
straight line horizontal or diagonal or

00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,030
yeah you'll get a special prize so it

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,060
has to be four of

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:34,400
or keywords in a row so i hope i had

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,400
some we're going to start my timer now

00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:46,620
okay one minute think mozilla think way

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:52,220
way back think everything in about

00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:58,010
Mozilla even people even projects

00:04:52,220 --> 00:05:03,650
significant events significant products

00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:03,650
anything meta meta pertaining to Mozilla

00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,870
last 30 seconds

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,900
most roni what's what's the prize it's

00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,990
gonna be awesome it's gonna be worth

00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,460
your minute for sure and then I'm going

00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:29,130
to give you a minute to look at the grid

00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:34,090
and if you create a pattern just shout

00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:42,640
bingo okay see bingo last five seconds

00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:47,620
five four three two one all right so

00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:54,280
here's the grid see if you have created

00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:58,360
a pattern so key words that I chose

00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:02,430
firefox firefox OS godzilla thunderbird

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:06,340
committee nonprofit open-source dinosaur

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:14,230
1998 netscape webmaker free software

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:17,560
Gekko muscles browser Wars Phoenix no no

00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:20,169
pattern what's the longest string that

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:29,100
you were able to create to anybody made

00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:36,490
to somebody made 23 who got three okay

00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:40,720
forgot dinosaur I who got another 30 and

00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:42,730
you were stopped by gecko so yeah so

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,700
Mozilla is these are some of the key

00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:50,350
words too bad nobody won the price would

00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:52,840
have been big awesome but these are

00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:54,430
keywords that you often associated

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:58,210
Mozilla so Mozilla is a nonprofit

00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:00,010
organization and it's it's the steward

00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,300
for one of the most successful open

00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:04,960
source projects of all time which is

00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:10,270
most of the Firefox and stemmed from the

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:13,810
Netscape organization in the late 1990s

00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:15,880
and now some some terms that were

00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,860
floated around like Godzilla the

00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:22,500
dinosaur had the Dino head and the logo

00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:26,140
before and you know Phoenix was the

00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,139
Phoenix was the code name for Firefox

00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,270
afford lunch

00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:30,499
yeah so so these are some of the stuff

00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,069
so if you haven't heard of Mozilla so

00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:38,719
this is a good test so of what mr. that

00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:40,580
does and this the this talk will

00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:44,409
primarily both around my experiences

00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:49,669
could your bidding around missoula so

00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:51,830
and I want to go back maybe almost 20

00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:53,270
years ago and you can't talk about

00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:57,819
Mozilla without talking about the

00:07:53,270 --> 00:08:01,279
browser Wars so what happened then was

00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:04,099
far he was dominating the brow browser

00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:08,900
market share firefox came into the fold

00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:11,539
and just change the game so if you look

00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:17,779
at the current browsers right now you

00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:19,400
see Chrome Firefox ie / edge opera I'm

00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:23,150
not sure if they're still around are

00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:26,169
they yeah they are still and Safari so

00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:29,599
if you look at all of these browsers

00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:37,360
from my point of view there's one thing

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:37,360
that makes firefox unique just look at

00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:45,589
Google there's Microsoft opera and Apple

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:48,350
almost all of those browsers have one

00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:50,630
major corporate organization backing

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,550
that browser and the thing is to the

00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,110
browser it's free it's a relatively free

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,050
market it's when you want to get a

00:08:54,110 --> 00:09:00,490
browser just download for free so for

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:03,339
these corporate backers to support those

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,899
browsers it's huge for those browsers

00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:09,410
obviously but for Mozilla which is

00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:12,980
really a non-profit and smaller compared

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,720
to Google Microsoft and Apple there is

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:20,920
one thing that really has it has it

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:26,529
going for that for Firefox and that is

00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:29,420
community it's the people that makes

00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:32,120
contributes to make firefox and Mozilla

00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:35,660
a success and hopefully you could do

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:38,180
that with your project as well so that

00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:40,640
is the one thing that makes firefox in

00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,680
this set of browsers

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,110
that's the one thing that makes it

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:48,830
unique and without and from my point of

00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:52,280
view without the community Firefox is

00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:55,010
just a piece of software that's not too

00:09:52,280 --> 00:10:00,740
different from from all these other

00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:03,260
browsers so why is committee good from a

00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:06,290
open source point of view it's very

00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:08,060
essential because obviously you want

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,470
people to contribute and you want to put

00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,140
people to participate and you want

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:15,500
people to add stuff their own stuff into

00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:18,260
their own into your own project because

00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:23,420
from my point of view and the way I see

00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:26,000
it open source runs on goodwill if you

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:29,540
don't have that your project might as

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,770
well pull my or you keep it by yourself

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:36,800
but if you don't have this goodwill your

00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:40,100
this is what fuels open source projects

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,590
from Linux all the way to the smaller

00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,050
open projects right now that's the one

00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:50,930
common thread that you will see in open

00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:52,580
source projects that have succeeded so

00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,900
let me talk about Mozilla reps so I've

00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,940
been talking about Mozilla I've been

00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,420
talking about community so let me talk

00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,560
about my own program in the Mozilla

00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,820
ecosystem where the Mozilla universe so

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:08,900
Missouri EPS is a volunteer program

00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:11,060
within Mozilla community so it's a think

00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,880
of it as a small unit inside Mozilla and

00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:16,790
it's it's a place where community

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:21,290
members and volunteers and staff members

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:25,040
work together to to do a variety of

00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:28,370
things like organizing events creating

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:32,300
managing social media testing

00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:36,200
localization and all those functions so

00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:38,270
Mozilla reps was started in 2010 and I

00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,220
was one of the very first moszer eps at

00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:43,190
him join so before mozilla reps i was

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,020
just a regular committee member doing

00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:47,480
community management for the philippines

00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:53,940
maybe but when missouri up started was

00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:57,550
really a program that was a intentional

00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:01,960
group to do those functions so what's a

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:05,320
similar analog it would be something

00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:07,440
like an ambassador program in other open

00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,180
source projects if this were a

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,770
for-profit organization because these

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:15,730
would be Mizzou reps would be similar to

00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:20,170
agents so my name and my experience I

00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:24,480
used to work for a one and A one is who

00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:27,940
hasn't heard of ey here no a one is a

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,980
cosmetics company that was that became

00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,050
very popular with the and became

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,660
successful because of Avon ladies so

00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:38,850
Avon ladies ladies who go to home

00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:42,100
house-to-house pitching their wares and

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:45,040
they're not employees of Avon they're

00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:49,660
they're considered agents or people who

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:52,779
go from place to place and reaching out

00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:56,589
to new customers so miserably the same

00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:58,600
way so how does Monsieur eps empower

00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:01,540
volunteers so it gives trusted

00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,520
volunteers access and resources so

00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:07,900
imagine there's somebody a committee

00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:10,330
member in Bangladesh and they want to

00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:13,720
help your project and they want to

00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:17,350
create a an event for their community to

00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:22,060
localize their software for their Lee

00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:24,279
for their dialect so what miserables if

00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:27,640
you are a member of the Missouri ops

00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:31,779
program you'll be able to request for

00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:36,070
funds will be able to request resources

00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:38,980
like maybe swag and marketing tools to

00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:42,610
promote your event and you'll be given

00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:46,390
an array of software to get people more

00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:47,890
involved like how do you there's a site

00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:51,459
there's a portal where you can post your

00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:54,670
events and you can post your and invite

00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:57,670
people to join your event it also

00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:01,779
provides support and mentorship the way

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:05,140
it's set up I'll go I'll go to this to

00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:07,720
detail later but there is a level of

00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:10,029
mentorship and when you join the

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,550
Missouri so there are people who have

00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:15,100
been in the community long enough like

00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,870
myself I've been around for six years

00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,660
and if there's somebody who wants to

00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:24,810
join now say here in the Toronto

00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:27,699
Community I I will be sort of like

00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:33,370
referred to that person and help that

00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:36,070
person do the community work so that's

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:40,329
how its set up and it's it's very

00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:43,449
organic it depends on how much help the

00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:45,910
new newbie or the new rep wants but I

00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:48,040
the weight set up there is a mentor

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:50,470
that's gonna be assigned to you as you

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,690
do your Missouri up work and then

00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,040
finally it's a password skill and

00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,779
professional a personal and professional

00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,850
development so there's a lot of scale

00:14:55,779 --> 00:15:01,329
buildings involved so in my case I

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:04,089
became a Missouri up 20 2010 I actually

00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:05,709
became a mentor around 2011 and is

00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:08,470
actually part of the Missouri ups

00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:10,540
Council more to that later for a few

00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:13,959
years and that leadership position in

00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:17,740
the Mozilla reps helped me become a

00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:19,420
better CEO / co-founder in my own

00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,680
startup when you're working with

00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,620
developers and whether you're working

00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:27,250
with having that sort of higher-level

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:29,020
thinking beyond your product the

00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:33,040
Missouri reps was very instrumental in

00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:34,990
giving me that so so if you have if you

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,699
have questions on on that aspect like

00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,470
you know finding your company and how

00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:40,180
that ready to my own experience with

00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:45,520
loser eps then I'd be happy to answer

00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:47,320
that later so so why is the moszer eps

00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,959
program working so where are the

00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:53,320
ingredients at least from my point of

00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:58,360
view why the most reps is working as a

00:15:53,320 --> 00:16:00,490
volunteer program and as a empowerment

00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,100
vehicle for volunteers one it has

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:05,140
support from the top so leaders in

00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,570
Mozilla recognized at mizzou reps is a

00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:10,140
key component of community engagement

00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,140
and

00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:18,440
it's i think i believe it was in 2013

00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:22,760
2014 missouri reps was actually

00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:26,050
mentioned in a very annual report so it

00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:29,300
is very huge to recognize that way

00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,950
second is it has structure so i'll let

00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,950
me i'll be talking about that in a bit i

00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,810
have a graphic i wanted to show you so

00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,790
missouri eps has structure in terms of

00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:40,550
organization structure making those

00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:45,560
requests so there is a foundation of

00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:48,020
making those things happen so it's it's

00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:51,590
easier for people to join and it's not

00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:55,820
it's not as bureaucratic and third is

00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:57,650
the quality of people so the thing with

00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,600
Missouri reps is it's a subset of a

00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,220
larger community so when you say

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,630
communites everybody who's contributing

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,730
to missoula everybody who is doing

00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:07,750
localization everybody who's pushing

00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:10,270
code or contributing code anybody who's

00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:14,000
sharing something in social media within

00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:15,920
that universe of contributors are the

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,170
most of the reps people who want to

00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,820
progress in their contributions and to

00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:23,990
want to do more and they want to have

00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:27,770
access to a lot more set of resources it

00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:30,020
takes us from that pool of volunteers so

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,940
you can imagine that if you had already

00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,830
reached becoming Arab that means you are

00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:36,350
very motivated you're very passionate

00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:38,210
about Mozilla you want to contribute you

00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,400
probably have friends and you know

00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:45,050
people within the community who want to

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:47,210
who have the same interests as you so

00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:50,480
what I wanted to do is spend is wanted

00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:52,360
to give you oh sorry give you five

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,510
minutes look at this very complicated

00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:59,090
graphic apologies it's it's very it's

00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,920
very heavy but what it illustrates is

00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:03,020
the structure of the Missouri reps so

00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,030
what is the missouri missouri structure

00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:07,100
so as i was talking about at the bottom

00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:09,530
of that graphic is the universe of

00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:12,200
mozilla contributors and missouri eps in

00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:14,810
a subset of that the leadership of the

00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,880
missouri eps program has what we call a

00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:21,050
council which is composed of volunteers

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:23,060
and which is seven and two paid staff or

00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,990
mozilla and then within that leadership

00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:28,110
are the mentors so

00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:31,820
let that sink in for a second so this is

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:34,920
a volunteer program majority led by

00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,270
volunteers it's not like they're yeah

00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,640
there's a couple of people there that

00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:42,320
are from Mozilla style they're Mozilla

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:45,330
staff and they have provide direction

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:49,760
recommendations but these council

00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:54,150
members are the leadership of the

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:56,610
volunteer base in Mozilla so that is

00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:58,620
very that is a very good picture of

00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,809
empowerment and these council members

00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:03,480
how do they become council members they

00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:08,220
get elected so there is a sort of

00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:12,240
democracy happening in that scheme as

00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:14,340
well so how does how this becomes

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,150
empowering is that you push your own

00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:21,210
volunteers up to the leadership and then

00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:23,250
they helped shape the experience and how

00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:30,920
they can contribute to your own

00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:35,100
organization goes so I want to give you

00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:37,770
five minutes to reflect and think about

00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:40,140
maybe you have a piece of paper or in

00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:44,910
your laptop these are the three key

00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:46,380
ingredients in the Mozilla reps program

00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,780
it makes it work so there's

00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:52,350
organizational support there is a

00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:54,000
structure although it's not know it's

00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,410
very complicated and third are the

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,610
people what are the kind of people that

00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:01,440
are best suited to become your open

00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:04,830
source contributors it's not as much as

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,620
you want everybody to join and be part

00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:09,900
of your movement the reality is there is

00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:14,640
a certain type of person or certain

00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:17,130
group certain persona that is best

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,460
suited for your open source project so

00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:22,020
i'll give you five minutes to work on a

00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:26,580
something similar so that you have some

00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:28,620
takeaways after this talk let me for

00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:33,350
this talk so maybe think about your

00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,350
project think about your own

00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:39,020
experiences and think about how you can

00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,210
create that organizational support and

00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,510
how can you make sure how can convince

00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:47,000
the leadership in your project to get

00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:50,180
volunteers involved and make that

00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,700
pathway possible and think about the

00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:56,120
structure how do you make sure that the

00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:58,010
power the sea power users but how do you

00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,980
make sure that the very passionate ones

00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:03,770
the very passionate volunteers move up

00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:06,050
the ranks is the worst thing is that I'm

00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:10,970
here I'm contributing I'm just doing my

00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:14,900
thing and if I want to move up or if I

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:20,420
want to do more I am held back by some

00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:23,630
structural or process a process in place

00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:27,710
in your project that prevents me from

00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:31,660
doing more and finally think about the

00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:35,330
people whose desk suited for your

00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:38,810
project so are they tech savvy people

00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:42,440
are they more into a specific language

00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:45,260
more specific technology are they more

00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,480
of like an advocate type of person or

00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,650
are they more of like you know you can

00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,540
just they just want to contribute in

00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:55,160
their own small way pushing code on

00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:59,300
github and all that all that development

00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:03,160
work ok so maybe maybe a couple more

00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,160
minutes just scribble it down

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,820
should we put my timer

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,070
alright

00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:34,379
cool now so maybe you should work on

00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:38,330
that okay probably finish that if you

00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:38,330
haven't finished we continue that later

00:22:38,989 --> 00:22:44,309
alright so I've been talking with mr.

00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:47,610
reps and how nice it is but what are the

00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:50,970
challenges it's not all it's not all

00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:53,159
perfect it's not all unicorns and

00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:56,070
rainbows what are the challenges that

00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:58,409
after five years in the program that

00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:01,139
I've and I'm seeing in observing as

00:22:58,409 --> 00:23:03,659
somebody from the inside first is the

00:23:01,139 --> 00:23:05,789
scalability so this is a global program

00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:08,759
there around four hundred reps in 80

00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:10,769
plus countries right now how do you

00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:15,139
manage that how do you make sure that

00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:20,600
everybody's contributing right and

00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:23,730
there's also a an issue of distribution

00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:26,159
who could guess where the most number of

00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:28,559
reps are from I told you there four

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,690
hundred reps globally in 80 plus

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,539
countries who can give me a guess where

00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:41,519
the most summary reps are from a country

00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:48,509
yes a country sorry nope rach UK not

00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:51,149
resile not China no not Canada last 11

00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:54,929
one more guess it's now it's on its

00:23:51,149 --> 00:23:56,220
India India is the place where most reps

00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:59,309
are coming from and the thing is

00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,590
distribution wise they they're probably

00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:04,320
take into account I don't know the exact

00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:06,299
numbers but there are 400 people there

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:10,350
they probably are almost ten percent of

00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:13,049
the program there a lot and from a

00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:17,960
scalability point of view in India there

00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:22,320
is not there isn't any Mozilla would say

00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:24,539
corporate entity based there so then it

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,169
becomes a problem there is some issue of

00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:31,200
really the community running itself and

00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:33,600
from a and from an open source point

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,460
view that is great that is very great I

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,369
would like my communities to be

00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,790
autonomous and I want them to be

00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:41,460
self-sustaining

00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:43,200
at the same time how do you make sure

00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,420
that they're aligned with what you want

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,850
to do and what you end they're

00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:50,850
supporting your goals and I'll get to

00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:53,250
some of the some of the real world stuff

00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:59,090
later especially with the local

00:24:53,250 --> 00:25:02,970
communities next would be oversight so

00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:04,470
yeah you could imagine we're as I told

00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:08,940
you a while ago mrs. reps are given

00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:11,100
resources and a lot of them are material

00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,460
resources some of them are financial

00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:16,170
resources so I give you money so

00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:20,400
question how do I make sure that the

00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:24,450
money that we're giving you are being

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:28,500
used for its intended purpose I'll give

00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:31,650
you a story I won't name the I won't

00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:35,910
name the local community but we had a

00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:38,280
rep who because what we do we basically

00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:42,450
file request saying hey I'm organizing

00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:44,250
an event for localization I would like

00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:48,480
five hundred dollars to support that

00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:50,250
event so what happened was he made a

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,720
request it was you know when you make a

00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,100
request it has to be like very

00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,660
comprehensive so give a very calm

00:25:53,100 --> 00:26:00,210
parents request he he an after the event

00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:02,430
you had to give photos like a post-event

00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:05,010
report like this what happened here are

00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:09,000
the photos so it kind of proof that you

00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:10,710
did what you what you claim but we got a

00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:17,420
report from somebody from the committee

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:23,480
that the person was elaborately staging

00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:26,880
fake events so he got his friends like

00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:30,270
okay guys let's let's I'll take photos

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,880
imagine you're doing some coding and I'm

00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:36,180
going to submit this blah blah blah so

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,990
that was an issue and that was dealt

00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:42,480
with obviously but it kind of but that

00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:45,960
was one of those very rare appearances

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,670
of mr. misrepresentation in the

00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,040
organization because like I said mozilla

00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:51,309
reps is a large program four hundred

00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,799
volunteers in a global

00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:58,090
committee and if that country doesn't

00:26:53,799 --> 00:27:01,450
really have a mozilla presence the

00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:03,009
community becomes mozilla like in my

00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:06,070
case when we started the philippines

00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:07,539
committee six years ago mazaa doesn't

00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:10,360
have an office in the philippines so

00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:12,850
when people have questions about Mozilla

00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:15,429
their go-to people are actually people

00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:17,860
from the community and we have and we

00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:19,870
had to do our best to be very you know

00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,279
on point when it comes to issues when

00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:26,019
they have questions because if it

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:29,429
becomes a larger question then we will

00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:32,679
refer them to head office in in

00:27:29,429 --> 00:27:36,369
California so there is an oversight

00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:40,149
issue or at least challenge on certain

00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:42,190
pockets of the community so third a

00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:44,259
challenge would be measuring impact so

00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:47,860
like I said we're organizing events or

00:27:44,259 --> 00:27:50,740
organizing outreach but the bottom line

00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:53,080
is how do you make sure that what we're

00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:56,169
doing actually helps Mozilla in the in

00:27:53,080 --> 00:28:00,269
the grand scheme of things like just

00:27:56,169 --> 00:28:03,700
being more specific like Firefox or or

00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:06,779
webmaker events like how do we track

00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:09,009
that people who attend our events

00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:13,929
download Firefox or actually become

00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:16,080
contributors or they actually become you

00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:20,759
know they participate in some capacity

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:22,960
there is given like I said the scale and

00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:25,749
the magnitude of what we're doing it

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,220
sometimes it's hard and you have to

00:28:25,749 --> 00:28:30,899
figure out where the key metrics is a

00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:34,509
tendency key metrics key metric is

00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:38,259
social media tweets and postings is a

00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:40,059
key metric so we there so discussions

00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:42,669
and conversations happening about how do

00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:45,100
you measure the impact and how do you do

00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:48,309
that and finally the challenge that I'm

00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:51,429
seeing is the program is starting to

00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:53,889
show its age what do I mean by that when

00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:55,629
we started around 2010 you'll see the

00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:59,019
membership in applications really it was

00:28:55,629 --> 00:29:01,509
really exponential lika it wet it went

00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:03,020
hockey stick like like it was really

00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:08,720
quiet and then boom

00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:11,240
2011 applications and reps membership

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,760
shut up but in the last year or so it

00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,130
has plateaued so what is that telling us

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:20,990
it's it's telling us that maybe we reach

00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:22,550
the critical the the mass or the the

00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:26,060
number of people who are really doing

00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:28,190
this and so if we have reached that how

00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:30,560
do we get back that exponential growth

00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:33,560
what do we need to do with the program

00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:35,360
to get more people or do we need to

00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,490
create a new program for that so there

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,030
are some conversations about that as

00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:46,060
well so so those are some of the

00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:46,060
challenges and issues that we are facing

00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:51,860
so so if you want to take away some of

00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:54,050
my personal experiences with community

00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:58,730
building if you want to show you some

00:29:54,050 --> 00:30:01,790
quick stories on what you could do and

00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:04,540
learn from from what I have from what

00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:06,770
I've done prior so to become good

00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:09,440
community manager happy relate so

00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:14,080
committee Mozilla is so it's a committee

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,080
of global commit of many volunteers and

00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:20,300
sometimes it's you fall into a trap like

00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:23,000
my my committee is better than your

00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:27,070
community or I'm better than you because

00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:32,210
you're from a community that is probably

00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:35,270
socially lower in terms of wealth or

00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:37,490
development and sometimes that you come

00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:39,320
to add mindset like it's it you could

00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:44,000
dismiss some people and put them in a

00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:45,170
box and you have to avoid that and you

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,660
try to relate and the good thing about

00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:49,940
Mozilla reps as an event is that we do

00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:52,340
try to make sure that everybody is in

00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:56,960
everybody's treated in with an equal

00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:59,060
footing and yeah so just try to relate

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:03,460
with two other people and don't try to

00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:03,460
think that you're better than somebody

00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:10,130
listening is also very important as a

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,960
commitment as a community person this

00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:14,179
was very highly around a couple few

00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:18,320
years ago if you hadn't heard

00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:20,269
the then CEO of Mozilla Brendan Eich he

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,929
stepped down because of some issues

00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:26,360
relating to a controversy rating to

00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:29,059
gender issues and it was a firestorm

00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:32,629
from all especially from the community

00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:34,759
because it was highlighted in the media

00:31:32,629 --> 00:31:38,149
when there are so small issues in the

00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:40,009
community like and you know a small

00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:42,610
spatter that it doesn't get highlighted

00:31:40,009 --> 00:31:46,720
but that one was one of the larger

00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:50,779
polarizing issues in the community and

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,399
from from my from where I SAT then it it

00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:55,759
was really tough because there were some

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:57,919
people who like the person but didn't

00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:00,190
agree with his politics there were some

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:04,429
people who were more aligned with his

00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:05,840
beliefs or his for what he did but they

00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:09,769
didn't care much for the person and then

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:12,740
there were some people just said who had

00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:16,279
thoughts on Mozilla as an organization

00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:18,169
as a whole so we tried our best to

00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:21,409
listen and try to accommodate people's

00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:24,409
views because for a lot of times people

00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:27,169
just wanted to be heard and you don't

00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:28,820
need to do anything because Mozilla you

00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:32,330
could look at wikipedia and how they

00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:33,710
dealt with that with that episode but

00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:35,990
from a community point of view being

00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:39,409
able to listen and try to just you know

00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:43,460
yeah what were your thoughts we had we

00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:45,799
had meetings virtual ones to let people

00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:48,970
air out their grievances or in their

00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:52,190
opinions or thoughts on that on that

00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:54,110
incident so it is very important and we

00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:56,299
did lose some people who you know I'm

00:32:54,110 --> 00:33:00,499
swearing off I'm never joining Mozilla

00:32:56,299 --> 00:33:02,450
or whatever but again we could have lost

00:33:00,499 --> 00:33:06,830
more if you didn't do a lot of listening

00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:10,850
and try to relate to other people too so

00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:13,369
in a solicit so in a community like as

00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:16,580
diverse as Mozilla people have ideas

00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:19,129
very good ideas and a lot of and most of

00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:21,230
the time they don't get her shared

00:33:19,129 --> 00:33:24,289
because people just shy dure quiet

00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:26,840
culturally they are predisposed to just

00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:27,860
sitting in a corner and not you know not

00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:32,179
sharing anything

00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:35,299
we try to make sure that people's voices

00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:39,559
are heard they can be contribute in

00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:41,420
meetings even in physical ones we try to

00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:44,570
make sure that you know if I feel you

00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:47,000
have anything to say please share we try

00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:50,179
to give people some time to gather their

00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,660
thoughts and share their opinions and

00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:56,809
ideas and it's probably easier in

00:33:52,660 --> 00:34:01,370
virtual meetings or IRC we can just chat

00:33:56,809 --> 00:34:05,500
whatever ideas they have but we make

00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:08,179
sure that everybody's voices are heard

00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,710
like I said sensitivity part I'm not

00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:14,629
going to elaborate on this one further

00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:17,899
but imagine in a global community like

00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:20,300
Mozilla you have you have a large group

00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:23,450
of people with diverse beliefs cultures

00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:27,590
and just have to be very sensitive about

00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:30,940
that and try not to try not to overstep

00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:37,010
or try not to alienate people

00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:38,990
systematically Oh practical ones have

00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:43,280
regular meetings like I said it could be

00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:48,230
IRC it could be skype hangouts this

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:51,530
rhythm makes the committee have a habit

00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:52,850
like a common habit for everybody even

00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:55,940
if you have just three people in the

00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:57,170
meeting have the meeting I'm interesting

00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:00,530
to say you know you don't have any

00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:04,280
updates even if it's iris he just you

00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:06,380
have to have like this this rhythm as a

00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,180
community together so that when people

00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:11,000
come in and join it's sort of like a

00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:15,230
natural cadence like every thursday

00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,810
around 11 a.m. eastern time everybody in

00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:19,580
the Miserables program we have a call so

00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:23,540
anybody who is free and would like to

00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:26,000
join destroyed and we have the council

00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:28,220
leading sharing those meetings and you

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,140
have an agenda prepared so you always

00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:34,190
have something to talk about but having

00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:36,260
that regular meeting even if it's not

00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:38,990
you know it's not a lot of people just

00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:42,770
just do it it would be better for the

00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:46,160
community in the long run and finally

00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:47,569
remember the big picture just remember

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,390
why you're doing what you're doing as a

00:35:47,569 --> 00:35:54,470
community and what why people are there

00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:58,390
what's wire where people motivated to to

00:35:54,470 --> 00:36:02,450
help and pitch in because in mozilla

00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:04,640
people have a diverse set of motivations

00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:05,960
but it's personal when its professional

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,819
whether it's they just want to do it for

00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,619
the heck of it I just remember that

00:36:07,819 --> 00:36:12,190
they're there for a reason and try to

00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:19,880
make sure that people are happy and

00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:22,220
motivated and in contributing okay so

00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,810
let's test what we have for this class

00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,430
well I'm going to show you a couple of

00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:27,560
mini case studies you can work with your

00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:30,260
pairs just discuss moving for a couple

00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:32,480
of minutes and let's do a quick mini

00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:34,460
case study then you know I'll probably

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,980
ask people you know what they're going

00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:40,579
to do in this case so these are just

00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:42,859
very quick cases so here's one so in

00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:45,829
your mailing list there is an anonymous

00:36:42,859 --> 00:36:48,140
poster criticizing your organization /

00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:50,930
project most of which are sound

00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:54,260
arguments again nothing is perfect right

00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:56,750
but he is that person that honest person

00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:59,750
is also hurling derogatory remarks about

00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:02,329
other members in the community so what

00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:05,359
do you do so you can chat with your

00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:07,520
partner there's no right or wrong answer

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,619
so I'm just curious because these are

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:12,680
some of the real issues or common issues

00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:15,560
at you'll face when you are managing or

00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:17,480
at least dealing with community so yeah

00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:20,630
maybe spend a minute chatting with your

00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,700
hair your partner and think about what

00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:24,770
are you going to do in this situation

00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:28,970
I'm going to end i'm going to cold call

00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:31,359
somebody what their thoughts are just

00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:31,359
one minute

00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,940
you'll be surprised this is one of the

00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:48,720
more and say the more tamer day

00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,720
Marquesas

00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:39,230
alright minute is up so who would like

00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:41,779
to share maybe there are other thoughts

00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:45,039
into in this case what would you do if

00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:49,160
you were the community person doing this

00:38:45,039 --> 00:39:10,819
I thought mice discussion over here so

00:38:49,160 --> 00:39:13,009
um would like me quick liner to so just

00:39:10,819 --> 00:39:31,039
just keep a tactical don't do anything

00:39:13,009 --> 00:40:08,509
but said what I heard yeah other huts

00:39:31,039 --> 00:40:13,779
miss on this side of the room yes good

00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:13,779
very sound last thought asked the idea

00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,230
that's a good yeah those are some again

00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:23,930
this is based off a real-life situation

00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:31,099
that we've encountered so that's a good

00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:36,140
that was one of the yes before yes but

00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:40,130
there was a generated to a the person

00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:41,869
over there as points like it was hard it

00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:44,000
was based on a situation where there was

00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:47,180
really a lot of the person was really

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,339
posting good very valid criticisms about

00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:52,400
Mozilla and organization but he was just

00:40:49,339 --> 00:40:54,769
he never used his real name or her real

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,500
name and kept on posting those issues

00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:59,660
and it was really tough because then

00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,849
people thought why is this allowed like

00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:04,730
why are we even allowing anonymous

00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:07,130
postings should we ban on his postings

00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:09,259
and people said not really because these

00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:12,079
this is good feedback it just so

00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:14,269
happened this guy is pissed with other

00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,279
other community members and some are

00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:19,609
even saying that he was the the claims

00:41:16,279 --> 00:41:23,240
or the allegations were not even they

00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:24,980
weren't even true so it's again there's

00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:28,069
no right or wrong answer here but in

00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:31,549
terms of what happened thankfully the

00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:33,529
email stop but what happened was the

00:41:31,549 --> 00:41:36,500
committee actually responded to that

00:41:33,529 --> 00:41:38,930
person to that email and they said you

00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:42,200
know this is if you if you want to bring

00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:44,420
this up to a in a proper channel then

00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:48,109
yes we could do it but you can't do it

00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:50,359
anonymously because who knows what cuz

00:41:48,109 --> 00:41:52,330
from the allegations that were who is

00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:57,420
all of them we're not

00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:57,420
not true so it was really tough but yeah

00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:06,070
yeah exactly because you have to take

00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:10,360
care for people's freedom of expression

00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:13,150
as well so it's it's a it's a balancing

00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:16,000
act for sure but what happened was this

00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:19,180
is based again on a real-life case on

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,730
what happened in terms of community so

00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:25,810
we have another our second and last mini

00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:27,880
case study is a bit harder so this is

00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:30,850
this the case so your organization as

00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:34,930
per legal requirements you can only work

00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:37,000
with volunteers are over 18 so selena is

00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:40,810
from Colombia she has been one of your

00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,570
most active local event organizers you

00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:46,120
received word somehow and that she and

00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:49,300
said that she's only actually 16 and

00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:50,980
that was published in her passport so

00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,320
after email exchange in clarifying with

00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:56,020
Selena she said that she is actually 18

00:42:53,320 --> 00:43:00,040
and she falsified her passport for

00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:04,960
travel purposes what do you do again is

00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:09,820
based on a real real situation so feel

00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:12,570
free to chat with your partner and yeah

00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:17,440
and discuss what you think would be via

00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:21,610
via would you put your plan of action

00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,620
like I said the only fixed the only

00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:26,220
constant here is that as for legal

00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:30,400
requirements you can only work with 18

00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:34,360
people AP and above yeah so they're so

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:38,550
what would you do definitely I'm not not

00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,550
as simple as the first case

00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:45,730
okay I'm done yeah

00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:04,369
luckily I said

00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,760
exactly

00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:56,070
last 20 seconds all right anybody who

00:44:54,120 --> 00:45:03,680
would like to share whether you're going

00:44:56,070 --> 00:45:07,190
to do look from this group home in I

00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,190
heard some yeah

00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:38,089
okay verena good other I'm gonna share

00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:40,440
with the update on this one yes not

00:45:38,089 --> 00:45:47,760
trying to do something negative is the

00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:50,310
wrong spin on that role yeah okay so

00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:54,390
this is I don't know the answer here

00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:56,070
because this is an ongoing situation but

00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:59,970
this is very loosely based on that

00:45:56,070 --> 00:46:02,480
somebody and below the age esper new

00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:05,580
mozilla reps hunted that person is under

00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:09,060
a certain age and that person was you

00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:11,849
know is a very active contributor and we

00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:14,130
in this pending so the many steps we

00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:16,589
keep the person in the witch

00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:18,720
documentation we take it's still

00:46:16,589 --> 00:46:20,880
happening but yeah as for legal

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:24,240
requirements there is a risk that if

00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:27,270
that if things go bad for example that

00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:30,000
person can just conveniently use the

00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:32,400
falsified passport hey I'm not eight I'm

00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,330
not 18 blah blah blah so there's a risk

00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:38,970
there so we can discuss the discussion

00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:42,839
after over lunch but just want to

00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:45,930
quickly recap what we discussed so far

00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:48,089
so miserably provides a path with your

00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:50,339
contribution and empowerment in the
