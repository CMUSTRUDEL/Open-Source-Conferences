	00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:30,150
I've known Mike for many years what I've

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:39,750
learned over the years whatever it is

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:42,840
he's talking about today gonna be a bit

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,100
rough so I apologize i was invited to to

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,420
make this just to fill in a spot for

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,129
another person this is a talk that I've

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,719
had rattling around in my head for a

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:50,430
while but I hope that you'll bear with

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,070
me and I hope that it'll be entertaining

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,660
the talk the original talks had was

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,399
called powers of two but that title is

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,309
sort of gotten outdated as I've worked

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,770
on it and we're through it but I talk I

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,239
start most of my talks with a reference

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,860
to a paper that was written back in two

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,140
thousand called I'm okay the bull is

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,060
dead and it's worth looking up it's

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,470
worth by a guy named Gopal Kapoor but

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,000
the gist of it is that if you have

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,100
anything to say to somebody in any

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,960
context certainly professionally you

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,759
always lead with the punchline don't

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,950
disseminate or don't assemble don't

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,180
sugarcoat what you've got to say lead

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:26,159
out with the most important things you

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,979
have to say so these are the big points

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,700
that I want to make about open source

00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:33,000
technologies and their long-term

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,530
survival basically promiscuity beats

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,750
correctness and will always out-compete

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,049
secrecy openness in the long term will

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,150
always beat closed a narrative the

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,619
ability to tell each other stories and

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,390
the ability to make our stories

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,579
compelling to each other is a key part

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,930
of making open source long term and

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,840
making your organization whatever it

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:55,350
happens to be last the institutions that

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,170
support our belief systems are tools

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,270
they are not an end in and of themselves

00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:02,310
so no matter how big or how important

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,920
that institution seems at any moment

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,590
whether it's Mozilla whether it's red

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,050
hat whether it's a government whether it

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,580
is a long-standing cultural institution

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,890
whether it's a bank

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,810
Vatican or anything those are means to

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,240
an end and they're not an end into

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,800
themselves and finally just get used to

00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,140
the idea that things are going to change

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,230
the idea that something whether it's a

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:28,380
piece of software or an idea or an

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:32,850
institution or a country is permanent

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:34,110
and in the long term is a lie and the

00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,400
victory conditions here I should get

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,600
that got these things in the long order

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,720
because what I really want to talk about

00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,580
here is a thousand-year roadmap and I

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,920
want to talk about how you can make an

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,320
institution and build an institution to

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,300
last not for a year or for five years or

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,040
for ten years but how you can build an

00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,200
institution and how you can design for

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,790
circle how you can design an institution

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,770
such that it is going to last that your

00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:01,440
idea is going to last for millennia

00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:02,490
victory conditions here are what is it

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,590
what is winning look like what is

00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,840
winning it long term the long term look

00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,610
like to you we have a set of hands what

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,200
is a long term victory look what is the

00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:16,440
long-term to you I've given you my

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:18,390
giving away my answer yep right

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,860
civilization still around right we can

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,570
still make valuable decisions we have

00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,140
things like running water that'll be

00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:26,310
good my own philosophy here is that a

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,070
victory condition if you're building

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,970
along building a really really valuable

00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,590
institution it's going to look at an

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,290
awful lot like what Paul Ford called

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,910
small pieces loosely joined it's going

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,709
to look like not one big monolithic

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,150
thing but a whole bunch of small parts

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:40,560
that can periodically be brought

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,269
together to add up to something great

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,480
and then maybe taken down and moved on

00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:46,920
to something else um but that's all

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,570
really kind of a Trojan horse because

00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,910
everything i'm going to say today is

00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,410
really secretly quietly going to be

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,330
about advancing Mozilla's values and

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,519
Mozilla's values as an organization and

00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:59,820
our goals of having a free open and

00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,110
participatory internet and a free open

00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,110
and participatory in the long term

00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,610
society and world and that's an

00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,290
interesting problem to talk about over

00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,239
the long term scale because right now

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,810
we're in an industry where depending on

00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:16,769
how you count there's between or and six

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:19,680
companies more or less that could spend

00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:22,260
two to three billion dollars on the drop

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,729
of a hat just to make us go away if

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,800
Larry Ellison wakes up on the wrong side

00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:26,780
of the bed one more

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,000
he decides he's annoyed enough he can

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,620
spend three or four billion dollars on

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,199
just on the strength of his annoyance

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,930
alone right and he might too because

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,690
he's that kind of guy but in that

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,970
context like in that context how do you

00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,440
start like if you've got a threat model

00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,030
like that how do you start planning for

00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,229
something that is a thousand years long

00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,729
something that's going to outlast not

00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:49,340
only Ellison but everything Ellison will

00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:50,479
ever do which will hopefully come sooner

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,569
than later but we can all keep every

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,159
rest about that and i'm going to do that

00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:56,900
by carrie picking a couple of historical

00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,889
examples but you know i'm going to do it

00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,120
in the way that all good stores are

00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:00,830
doing i'm going to cherry pick a couple

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,969
of good examples i'm going to tell some

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,139
funny stories about them and then i'm

00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:05,090
going to try and tie that into one

00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:08,530
larger narrative that hopefully is going

00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:11,330
to all make sense at the end of this um

00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:13,879
but like i said this talk is expected to

00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:16,849
be a little bit rough so I hope you'll

00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:18,139
bear with me while I ramble on it turns

00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:21,199
out that when you're submitting an

00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:23,180
application to talk here saying that you

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,370
intend to just ramble on aimlessly for

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:28,039
like an hour those talks don't get

00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,270
accepted that might end up being what

00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:31,370
happens here but you're going to have to

00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,389
bear with me um the one point that I

00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,279
want to make though before we get going

00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:36,440
is that over this long term scale

00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:37,430
selection pressure is real right and the

00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,440
important thing to understand about

00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,349
selection pressure is that selection

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,719
pressure does not have a moral value

00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:47,449
judgment associated with it none there

00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:49,340
is nothing like right or wrong in nature

00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:51,139
there is only fit and unfit but the

00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,509
other side of that is that selection

00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:55,219
pressure is a force right it is a thing

00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:56,900
that you can see and understand it it's

00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:58,520
a force in the same way that the tide is

00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,219
a force that gravity is a force that the

00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,169
wind is a force once you see it and once

00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:04,759
you understand it then you can start to

00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:07,190
accommodate it you can start to not only

00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:08,509
just not only take it not only

00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,849
understand it you can take advantage of

00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:12,199
it in a long term and the same force

00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:14,029
that gives us like it doesn't when it

00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,949
doesn't say judge when I say rather that

00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:17,599
it doesn't make judgments I mean that

00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:19,729
the same selection pressure that gives

00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,300
us very graceful beautiful creatures

00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:25,669
like gazelles or silverback gorillas you

00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,849
know or swallows also gives us things

00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:32,690
like cockroaches and angler fish and

00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:35,100
this guy right

00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,540
which is one of many many nightmares

00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,850
that you will find out if you go to the

00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,590
wrong corner of the surface of the earth

00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:43,350
but for the most part it looks like this

00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,730
and this is um these are Charles

00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,590
Darwin's finches these are sketches

00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,970
taken this is a sketch a black and white

00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:50,820
sketch because Darwin didn't have a

00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:53,250
white pen on black paper taken from

00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,560
Charles Darwin's notebook and his

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:58,290
details of what evolution looks like in

00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:02,430
the sort of midterm Darwin's finches

00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:04,290
tend to be animals that all have a hard

00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,430
time into breeding they don't quite eat

00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,960
the same things though there's some

00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,460
overlap there they don't quite seeing

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,410
the same songs they don't quite talk to

00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,440
each other but from a certain distance

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:15,390
you can tell those are all finches right

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,370
and that the evidence that there is a

00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,380
vibrant community there is not evidence

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,750
that there is one there is a lot of one

00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,220
kind of Finch right but a robust diverse

00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,780
community there is there's lots of

00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,600
different things that you can kind of

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:32,310
tell revenge all singing songs that kind

00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:34,590
of sound like Finch songs and so why

00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,970
does um the next question we got a lead

00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,220
up to here is why I want to do this at

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,390
all and why does open source matter at

00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,979
all how does anyone here have a good

00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:44,100
answer for that I know what I think

00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:45,780
about why open source matters um you're

00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,620
not saying anything you're adjusting the

00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:51,930
camera when all right um why does open

00:07:49,620 --> 00:08:01,700
source software matter at all why should

00:07:51,930 --> 00:08:01,700
we have this it's a stain really one yes

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,099
it matches the values they were raised

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,969
with that's a pretty good answer and

00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:09,349
we're going to come back to something

00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:11,449
that looks an awful like that fairly

00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:13,819
soon the reason it matters to me

00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,939
personally and increasingly I hope it's

00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:18,979
going to matter all of you is that we

00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:20,689
codify as Chris Tyler mentioned earlier

00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:22,909
today we codify a lot of the decisions

00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:24,620
that we make about the world and about

00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:26,840
how things should interact with each

00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,219
other and how machine should talk to

00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,039
each other and make decisions we codify

00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:32,269
that in software and real human lives

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,940
depend on the outcomes of those

00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:37,039
decisions right and not just in the near

00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,449
term industrial accident kind of things

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,880
but as we encode more things into

00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:44,000
software basic stuff like the value of

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,649
our time the value of our votes god help

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,959
us if we start doing that of questions

00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:49,399
of justice and basic human decency are

00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:52,100
going to get written into software and

00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:53,990
if we start building tools that make

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,910
decisions about human society without

00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,870
being able to see into them and without

00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,029
being able to understand the

00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,680
complexities of how those things

00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:02,089
interact not only with the problem

00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,220
domain they're facing but with

00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:05,570
everything else around them if we can't

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,870
see into those machines and understand

00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:11,720
how they work we're screwed great

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,579
conversation I had with a fellow there's

00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,930
a high ranking fellow at Samsung talking

00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:16,730
about the Internet of Things who

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:20,899
observed that that they can very easily

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,610
sell you a device that for example turns

00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:24,560
off the water in your house if they

00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,730
discover there's a flood so okay

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,870
something is overflowing you've got a

00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,730
sensor in the bottom your basement we

00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,680
turn the water off that's great and we

00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,120
can also very easily sell you a device

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,579
that turns on the sprinklers in your

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,740
house when there's a fire right great

00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:38,810
except if we sell you both of those

00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,640
devices then there's this horrible edge

00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,019
case where there's a fire in your house

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,190
and then the sprinklers turn on and then

00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:45,380
the sprinklers turn off again and then

00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:47,720
your house burns down right that is only

00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,180
two things supplied by the same vendor

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,529
right Chris alluded to this earlier when

00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,360
he said that there is going to be many

00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:55,640
hundreds of vendors having many hundreds

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,769
of island did decisions and getting the

00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,240
I the idea that we have to be able to

00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:00,560
look into decisions like that but don't

00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,260
just affect our houses but affect our

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,720
society right and affect our lives as a

00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,820
whole matters a lot but I have an even

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,750
better question than that what is

00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:13,790
software at all said when like if I were

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,840
to ask you what is software and by now

00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,890
all of you are kind of like

00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:20,890
it's a trap I don't want to stick my

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:24,370
hand up um because he's out of it yes

00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:29,240
right is it an idea or is it a machine

00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:30,620
right it's both right and there's not a

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,590
lot of things in the world that are like

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,880
that right in terms of engineering and i

00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,290
would think one of the reasons we

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,850
struggled with software engineering for

00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,230
so long is that there's no comparison

00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,770
that there's nothing comparable to that

00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:47,000
in terms of raw materials right that is

00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:48,980
both a an ocean like a plan and the

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,570
machine that execute that plan that

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,550
halves at the same time but we do have a

00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:56,720
few things in the world that are like

00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:58,790
that and that's these right there's a

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,620
couple of others right but not very many

00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,330
and their big picture things and the

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:05,110
line between these things things that

00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:07,040
are both ideas and machines and

00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,950
processes that change the way we

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,810
interact and change things of scale is a

00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:13,810
lot blurrier than you might think um

00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:21,370
what why is why is a dollar like what is

00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:28,070
money what makes money money right

00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:30,890
pardon me right money is just paper but

00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:32,510
why is money worth anything right right

00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,800
because could we given it value right

00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,790
and the same thing is true of language

00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,530
did the same thing is ultimately drove

00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,910
software like why does software have any

00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:41,360
power to make decisions is because we've

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:42,620
imbued it with all that power right so

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,090
I'm going to argue here that there are a

00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,920
couple of things that we can learn when

00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,390
we're building organizations and there

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,660
are a couple of things that we can do

00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:51,860
deliberately to shape the ways we build

00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,390
ideological organizations specifically

00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,530
the ones that ship software specifically

00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,660
the ones that ship open source software

00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:58,400
and we can learn a lot about the

00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,500
durability and survivability of those

00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,230
organizations by taking some lessons

00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,180
from historical thing some historical

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:08,030
lessons from things that have survived

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:11,090
for a long time along by human standards

00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:14,120
right which is kind of kind of adorable

00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:17,420
if you're a tree but you get the gist of

00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,440
it um and there's a lot we can there's a

00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,430
lot of lessons we can take from the

00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,950
things that have survived in from the

00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:23,690
things that happened so we're going to

00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,400
start off I think by talking tag if

00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:27,870
there's hands at any point like if any

00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,160
of you want to interrupt this del you

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,770
of words that's coming out of me that's

00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:35,330
probably okay might help everyone take a

00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:37,650
breath and inhale that'd be good um oh

00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:42,680
good oh I have water here that's even

00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:47,660
better uh does anyone recognize this oh

00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:50,970
we got a show of hands here um yourself

00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:55,010
yes that is exactly what it is this is

00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:57,990
the Antikythera mechanism was called I

00:12:55,010 --> 00:13:01,290
was fished out of the fished out of the

00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:02,640
ocean around 1900 memory I should have

00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,800
written that date down the exact date

00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:09,330
but this was fished out of a dive site

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:12,089
around 1900 it dates to around 200 BC at

00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:15,510
the time that was considered a very

00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:18,900
controversial judgment because nothing

00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:20,910
else in that time period comes close to

00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,050
the degree of complexity to the degree

00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:26,100
of sophistication that we've seen in

00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:27,390
this thing in terms of world history we

00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,680
went but we've gone back to this thing

00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,560
they are the artifact had been carbon

00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,060
dated to around 200 BC which was hard to

00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,560
believe because clock making of that

00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:40,740
sophistication didn't show up in Europe

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:42,209
until the mid 14 hundreds right we only

00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,700
started to understand how this thing

00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:47,430
worked after taking some fairly

00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,860
extensive x-rays of it between a fairly

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,959
extensive x-rays in 1970s 1976 a

00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,310
researcher took some x-rays of it went

00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:54,839
back to the original site started

00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,420
combing up more pieces figuring out how

00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:01,589
all goes together this device was a

00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:04,380
device in a / me oh I forgot the word

00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:07,620
not heliocentric but tear eccentric is

00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,850
that the one the kara centric model this

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,010
was a device that you could crank by

00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,540
hand that would predict as far ahead as

00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,400
you want to go in the future as far back

00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,620
as you want it to go the position of all

00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,300
the planets relative to a heliocentric

00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,990
position so extremely complicated

00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:23,970
gearing very sophisticated for like very

00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:26,310
sophisticated for the 1400s I'm

00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,810
absolutely unheard of in two thousand

00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:33,830
the information about how this was built

00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:33,830
where it comes from lost right this is

00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:38,310
1500 years before things like the

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,160
Babbage engine or even a twinkle in

00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,649
anyone's eye

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:44,620
on the other hand meanwhile at about the

00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:46,389
same time here's this great thing this

00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,980
if you want the original disruption

00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:51,220
here's two industries in one this is

00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:53,230
paper right the first paper started

00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:57,550
coming out of China and around 200 BC

00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:59,410
and it was amazing because papers solved

00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,449
two different kinds of problems for two

00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:03,600
different categories of people the first

00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:06,279
thing that it does is that information

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,160
had been stored previously to that on

00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:11,379
either bone or bamboo and it turns out

00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,480
that store in moving any kind of

00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:14,829
quantity of bone or bamboo slats around

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,889
no matter how valuable the information

00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:21,040
is is really hard and people who value

00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:22,600
moving information around turns out two

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,449
kinds of people there's farmers and

00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,310
there's the military right and this also

00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:28,689
solved the problem of making things

00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,040
really really cheap because silk was

00:15:28,689 --> 00:15:31,870
expensive silk was the alternative and

00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,750
that was much more expensive and it was

00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:36,279
too so the secret to making paper rather

00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,689
than being held close rather than being

00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:39,009
lost the secret to making this was

00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:42,160
immediately disseminated to everyone

00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:44,470
right paper became a very very common

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,600
thing very very quickly because it was

00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:49,360
too valuable to be kept secret right

00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,899
this is this is some original piece of

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,370
killer technology right here um let's

00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:56,139
see what else and the interesting thing

00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,880
about this is there's two parts of it

00:15:56,139 --> 00:16:01,149
the first thing that is is that meets a

00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,790
couple of really important needs and not

00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:05,199
like market needs or near term needs or

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,689
seasonal requirements but it meets an

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,720
ongoing human requirement to communicate

00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:14,079
um the second one is that with the

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,550
Chinese the Chinese own military at the

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,560
time is that it meets an institutional

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,329
need as well write it meets an ongoing

00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,470
need from a large organization to

00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:22,809
support the dissemination of that

00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:24,490
information and we're going to keep

00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:26,649
coming back to little themes like this

00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:29,319
over and over again we are meeting needs

00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:31,689
from meeting paired sets of needs from

00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:34,809
radically different groups goes a long

00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:37,120
way to making sure that your idea or

00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:40,870
your ideology has a great deal of

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,300
temporal durability um and it's not just

00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:46,540
physical things right ideas have that

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,639
same quality do these ideas represent a

00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,499
change in a change for the better in the

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:55,539
way people or organizations work

00:16:50,499 --> 00:17:00,999
um and that brings us to this guy said

00:16:55,539 --> 00:17:04,539
10 this 10 this I know that this is very

00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:06,579
important to some of you this is Emperor

00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:09,339
conch this is an icon representing

00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:11,230
Emperor Constantine the first if i say

00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:13,870
that is anyone Emperor Constantine the

00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:18,610
first he was the first one kind of a big

00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:21,879
deal so what this fella did which can I

00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:24,220
pardon me I've got a deal with my thing

00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:26,289
Hamlet's and for Constantine did a

00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:31,330
really interesting thing he legalized

00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:33,909
Christianity up until up until that

00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,620
happened this was in the early this was

00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:38,169
much much earlier than the earlier than

00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:42,429
the 380 ad that I mentioned was about

00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:44,950
300 and he team I think he legalized

00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:47,740
Christianity at a time when it was a

00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:50,799
considered a marginal or non in Oakland

00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:53,019
a disallowed religion in the Roman

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,279
Empire at the time and he paved the way

00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:57,789
for it to be adopted as the state

00:17:54,279 --> 00:18:00,850
religion in 1380 um there's a lot to be

00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:02,740
learned from the rise of Christianity in

00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,149
a situation where the dominant Roman

00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,950
Empire the dominant religion of the time

00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:10,389
was the pagan deities of the Roman

00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:12,480
Empire because Christianity grew over

00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:16,929
what I would argue was the first

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,990
well-managed safe multi national network

00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:23,950
of any kind and those are the Roman

00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:26,139
roads right the growth of Christianity

00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:28,110
followed along followed the society

00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:32,080
fault society through the slave casts um

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:34,119
in a very rapidly grew along pardon me

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,909
very rapidly grew along a network that

00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:40,600
had been established by an unfriendly

00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:42,100
and inhospitable organization that

00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,710
couldn't stop its use and this may be a

00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,419
familiar tune to some of you right if

00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:48,309
you are used to dealing with things on a

00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:49,690
network that is not fully your own that

00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:51,610
you need to take advantage of any way

00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:54,600
all right if you're a phone company this

00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:58,149
is a particularly relevant story right

00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,740
right so more generally there is a lot

00:18:58,149 --> 00:19:01,570
to be learned like and I really

00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,070
apologize for providing what has to be

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,370
the most superficial understanding of

00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,240
this pier

00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,290
that you're ever going to boot I'm

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,660
trying to cover a couple of hundred

00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:16,240
years of history in like I very hand

00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:17,590
wavy like three minutes here um but the

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,910
various incarnations of Christianity

00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:22,120
over that time the various institutions

00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:24,970
of it managed to leverage the strengths

00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,950
of the existing Roman Empire to get to a

00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,840
point where the Roman Empire no longer

00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,520
deny that it was no longer distance

00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,900
existence or marginalize it but

00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,170
eventually adopted it as a state

00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,760
religion which lasted quite a bit which

00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,830
lasted essentially until the Roman

00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,170
Empire itself collapsed there's more to

00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,670
learn from that afterwards because the

00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,860
collapse of the Roman the claps of the

00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:47,140
original Roman Empire did not in itself

00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:50,020
result in the collapse or end of

00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:52,350
Christianity Rome is done right the

00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:55,390
barbarians have arrived that that

00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:57,010
that Empire is over but the belief

00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,260
system that was built on top of it has

00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:01,720
lasted and it's lasted by being very

00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:03,790
loosely coupled to the organization that

00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,410
it took advantage of right and this is

00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:08,290
their lesson for this is your ideology

00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:09,820
probably your belief your idea can take

00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,320
advantage of places but it has to be

00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,600
able to survive the loss of those

00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:16,840
organizations or those institutions that

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,940
are relied on as well um same a very

00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,410
similar thing happened during his to

00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,210
Islam during the failure of the ghoul

00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:24,130
during the last days of the Golden Age

00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,720
of Islam the last days that was

00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,510
centuries but I'm waving my hands around

00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:31,600
so bear with me is that the notion of

00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:33,670
Islam even though it was ended up being

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,110
several different kinds of Islam in

00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,640
several different kinds of Christianity

00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,920
the forking tree there is magnificent

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,390
lots of different granular beliefs about

00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,710
this is the right way to do this no this

00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,540
is the right way but if you step back a

00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,520
distance from that we can agree that

00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:47,740
these people all follow roughly the same

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,290
school of thought the ideology the

00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,940
belief has survived the deaths of the

00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:55,900
institutions the fragmenting of the user

00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:57,280
base and the eventual reunification all

00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,210
that matters and I want to compare that

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,440
with something that happened at about

00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:04,090
the same time to Damascus steel Damascus

00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,950
steel was also something that was a

00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:08,020
product of the same roads and the same

00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:10,179
ability to suddenly travel from place to

00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:13,510
place it was a product of roots steel

00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:14,980
imported from from India to the Smiths

00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,630
of Damascus who had a particular

00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,049
fabrication method that enabled them to

00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,419
make

00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:22,330
a medal that was centuries ahead of its

00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:24,070
time right swords and cannons that were

00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:26,379
praised for their flexibility their

00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:28,659
durability their ability to be strong

00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:30,279
and remained resilient under enormously

00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:33,009
difficult circumstances it's only in the

00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:34,749
last 100 150 years or so that we've been

00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:38,049
able to make metals that are this good

00:21:34,749 --> 00:21:39,970
right and a lot has changed you know

00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:42,460
like metallurgy today is amazing you

00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:44,200
could take any spring steel bar out of

00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,519
any truck suspension right now and if

00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,350
you could send that back to a middle

00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:48,580
aged of Shogun you'd be able to have a

00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:50,259
part of the kingdom named after you

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,539
right because we're really good at it

00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:56,950
now right but we started building this

00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:59,320
in 380 late 380 right and eventually

00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:02,590
despite the fact that it was going on

00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:06,100
until the lates the mid-1700s somehow

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,509
the secret to this was lost right the

00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,580
secret from making Damascus steel is

00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:10,899
gone we don't know how it's done there's

00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,190
a lot of people have got theories about

00:22:10,899 --> 00:22:14,049
how it was made there's been a lot of

00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:17,049
research and experimentation into how it

00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:19,299
was made um we only recently managed to

00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:20,830
learn about the carbon nanotubes carbon

00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:22,809
nanotubes you all know what a carbon

00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,859
nanotube is it's a tube made of carbon

00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:27,940
and it's small because that's what it

00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:29,649
says on the tin but the but now that

00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:32,080
we've got electron microscopy that is

00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:34,330
capable of looking at metal at that

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,950
granular level of detail we find that in

00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,809
fact the Damascus steel is somehow full

00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:39,549
of carbon nanotubes and there was a

00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:42,970
process that enabled them to make those

00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:47,679
in 350 ad and we just somehow forgot

00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:49,570
about it the lesson here is about

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,639
islanded knowledge the lesson here is

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,559
about isolated concerns and concerns

00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:55,239
that are so isolated that nobody who's

00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:57,100
at one end of that supply chain knows

00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:58,570
how the other end of it works right

00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,759
nobody who's got a bar of wootz steel

00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:02,259
and is turning it into a sword knows how

00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:05,440
to get a bar would steal from anywhere

00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:07,149
right anything that is built and

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,190
historically this happens over and over

00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:10,809
again if you ever read Umberto Eco he's

00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:13,149
got magnificent anecdotes about this

00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:15,159
anything that is built where a secret is

00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:17,259
built on top of another secret that

00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:19,600
information is gone like it is

00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:21,909
incredibly delicate however miraculous

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,609
the result is not it is incredibly

00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:26,080
delicate to history to try and build

00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:27,490
something that is not really fully

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,929
documented or understood on top of

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,880
something else that's also a secret

00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:32,290
because the more you build see

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,260
it's in a stack the more brittle that

00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:36,880
stack becomes and over and over again we

00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:40,030
lose things we lose knowledge we lose

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,100
information because that chain of events

00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:44,020
because having a secret is considered to

00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,710
be powerful and in the narrowest terms

00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,960
time it kind of is but in the long term

00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:52,330
eventually those chains break down that

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,910
brings us to hear um this is 780 how are

00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:57,970
we doing for time am i lonely oh my god

00:23:54,910 --> 00:24:01,300
I'm halfway through already jeez um and

00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:04,930
this this is a good time does anyone

00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:07,090
know what this stuff is great party yeah

00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:09,460
you you that you're both in line I'm

00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:12,010
sorry it so both yes this Isle of people

00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:15,010
can answer the question but that you

00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:18,010
agree yes this is Greek fire um Greek

00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:19,210
fire was terrifying in its day it's a

00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:21,670
weapon of war that was employed by the

00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:22,990
Byzantine Navy a hugely important state

00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,880
secret and the thing that's really

00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:26,740
underappreciated by this pardon me the

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,470
thing that was magic about this stuff

00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,760
what is that it would not turn off um

00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:34,060
you pour fire on it at her and hotter

00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:36,490
the story was so an excellent thing for

00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:38,050
a ship if you wanted to set fire to

00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:40,450
another incoming worship and this was a

00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:43,240
this was the this was the atomic bomb of

00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:45,040
its time right adis ice a decisive

00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:49,660
weapon of war in a naval engagement that

00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:51,250
no one else could replicate and the

00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,860
interesting thing about it is that it is

00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:55,930
not just the chemistry of it the

00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,820
chemistry is lost right the chemistry

00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:01,900
that of how to make this stuff is long

00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:03,880
gone but the other part of it that was

00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,710
also critically important was that it

00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,750
was also a system like it was a nozzle

00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,400
and a mechanism for pumping stuff

00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,610
through that nozzle and a whole bunch of

00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:15,070
other stuff that comprised the intact

00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:16,750
the intact Greek fire whereas the the

00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:20,020
Byzantines called it manufactured fire

00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:23,410
system right it was a unified it was a

00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:25,750
unified stack of secrets and if any one

00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:27,310
of those secrets was lost eventually the

00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:30,430
entire stack was no longer operational

00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:35,530
you may find this familiar to some

00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:36,570
modern contexts um implausibly there's a

00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:39,450
couple of

00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:40,380
a couple of stories around the history

00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:42,419
of this that may or may not be

00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,309
mythological around one family keeping

00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:45,960
the secret for a long time which seems

00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:48,149
kind of unlikely because one family

00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,529
keeping stuff for a long time is kind of

00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:50,940
a dodgy thing we're going to see that

00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:53,549
again a minute but the lesson remains

00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:56,720
the same is that secret secrets on their

00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:59,190
own are hard secret systems are

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,080
astoundingly brittle and history is not

00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:05,190
kind to anyone who wants to keep them

00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,480
intact contrast this right has anyone

00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,980
ever been here I wanted to be here I

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,899
wanted to go to this place last time I

00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:14,519
was in Japan but I never got a chance to

00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:17,159
go this pardon me you know I one saying

00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:18,330
something no I'm just hearing things now

00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:23,220
that I'm rambling on like a crazy person

00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:24,990
this is great this is and i'm going to

00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,970
ask whoever can hear this to forgive me

00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:30,539
for the mispronunciation is the neshamah

00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:33,000
onsen kon kon it is the oldest running

00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:35,190
continuous business in the world when

00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,889
running for 52 generations by the same

00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:42,480
family in the same place in japan right

00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:43,850
you can see that it may not look the way

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,230
it looked when it was originally built

00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:48,149
because at the very least there's things

00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,679
like electric lights which are I mean

00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:52,860
fantastic it's important not to be

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:55,289
dogmatic about fire lights but if it

00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:59,220
sounds kind of unlikely to you like 52

00:26:55,289 --> 00:27:02,970
generations of people who like how

00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:04,980
likely does that sound to you anybody

00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,480
does anyone like you wouldn't bet money

00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:10,379
on that right like we're gonna make this

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,299
last 52 generations right and that that

00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:13,590
sounds unlike you unlikely pardon me to

00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:17,129
you that's because it really really is

00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:18,720
um because in this context particularly

00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:19,860
in Japanese context you have to

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,500
understand that there is a Japanese

00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:24,539
tradition of adult adoption which is

00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,409
great because what it mean one

00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:26,580
interesting part of that is that

00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:28,259
ninety-seven percent is that

00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:31,110
ninety-seven percent or thereabouts-- of

00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:35,129
adoptions in Japan are of 25 to 30 year

00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:37,049
old men into your family you adopt them

00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:39,120
because there's a tradition there's a

00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:40,980
male lineage thing and perhaps the male

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,450
heir you have just is not up for the job

00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,059
and you don't think that he's quite

00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:47,460
ready for game time yet there are other

00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:50,040
problems with it with them right there

00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:52,320
is a great long-standing tradition where

00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:54,240
you keep the family name you keep the

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,910
family lineage on paper but you're not

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,980
actually that dogmatic about the

00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:00,630
bloodline part of the family which is a

00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,970
very odd thing from our Western

00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:06,500
perspective but in Japan this is how you

00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:09,630
get to the 52 generational businesses

00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,860
the oldest company in Japan that is not

00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:13,140
in the same place as a construction

00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:16,470
company that follows the same practice

00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:19,710
that date back to 572 ad and it's

00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:21,300
amazing that the same business the same

00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,620
business name has lasted that long and

00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,030
there's a couple of interesting things

00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:27,150
that you can say about this first one

00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:29,250
probably being that being dogmatic about

00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:31,320
stuff is an attack surface the number of

00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,090
things that you are dogmatic about when

00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,520
you are trying to found your I

00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:37,080
organization when you are trying to say

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,370
that this is a long-standing

00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,890
organisation the number of things that

00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:43,200
have to be strictly just so you want to

00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:44,820
keep that to a very minimum right I mean

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,070
week this organization here could be

00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,510
dogmatic about the definition of family

00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,590
they could be dogmatic about the

00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:51,210
structure of the building they're in

00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:52,890
they could be dogmatic about the

00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:55,740
location and what they've chosen to be

00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:59,580
dogmatic about is the existence of the

00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:01,890
company and the place and that's it

00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,120
right and by minimizing the number of

00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,290
things that we have to get strictly

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,000
right you get an awful lot of

00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:08,060
flexibility that allows for continuity

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,320
of care that would not otherwise exist

00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:15,960
um all right here I asked this earlier

00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,490
what makes money is a really really

00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,820
valuable because it turns out money is

00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:24,240
money has all of these kind of unusual

00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:26,160
properties to it first of all like now

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,010
that we're past the gold standard like

00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:33,800
why is gold valuable because it's shiny

00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:37,440
and enough people like that um why is a

00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:39,950
what paper money why is paper money

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,950
valuable

00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:51,960
pardon me oh not it might be it's not

00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:53,760
now right um but it's interesting paper

00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,140
money is but you're right though that

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,090
paper money is an abstraction layer

00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:07,800
right that has meant different things

00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:09,180
yes well yeah right um so paper money

00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,550
started out being an abstraction layer

00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:15,330
where you would have liked pounds

00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:18,120
sterling like an a pound sterling was an

00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:20,310
honest-to-god physical pound of sterling

00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,840
silver right and if you had enough car

00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:23,040
and if you had enough coins to make up a

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,430
pound of those coins you out a pound

00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,660
sterling silver um which it turns out is

00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:30,270
super inconvenient to walk around with

00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:33,420
your pockets full of that stuff so you

00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:39,000
don't sew around let's see this happened

00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:39,870
in the late 1600s I think of 16 I really

00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,670
should have written this down in my

00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:44,130
notes this is one of the earliest pieces

00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:47,190
back this is one of the earliest pieces

00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:49,320
of paper money this is essentially a

00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:51,780
handwritten partially stamp this is from

00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,810
the Stockholm Banco in Stockholm Sweden

00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:56,700
them it's one of the earliest pieces of

00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:59,100
paper currency being issued rather than

00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,660
coins and this is really interesting

00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,120
because this represented a step away

00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,980
from the actual metal right so we

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,050
believe the metals valuable and then we

00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,390
believe that the paper is a

00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:11,700
representative place for the metal so

00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:13,140
we're one layer away from where you know

00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,420
where we're getting further and further

00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:19,050
away from the metal if that expression

00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:20,460
means anything to you at the bank of

00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:22,740
england actually shortly after this

00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,260
started issuing standardized paper

00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:27,240
currency certificates all right what we

00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:30,990
come to realize is and eventually in

00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:33,120
standardized denominations and this

00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:35,670
becomes of course standardized and

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,100
because it's a standardized idea that

00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:40,170
affects people's lives and that causes a

00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:42,660
bear you know causes the circular wheels

00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:44,780
of commerce to turn eventually something

00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:46,560
really interesting happened see you

00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,640
pardon me I'm going to get back to this

00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,330
eventually something really interesting

00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:53,360
happens with the money um

00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:55,070
aeon currency fiat currency happens we

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,799
have the gold standard we have the

00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:00,440
silver standard and we say that in order

00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:02,630
to declare that our money has money as

00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,649
value that it is worth an equivalent

00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:07,789
amount of that other thing that has

00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:10,010
value and then all of a sudden we reject

00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:11,899
the boat standard we don't have backed

00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:13,700
currencies anymore certainly not North

00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:16,399
America there are very few places that

00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,440
do because the abstraction has become a

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:21,010
layer in and of itself and this is an

00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,059
amazing trick okay have you ever seen um

00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:25,370
you've seen that bit where they pull the

00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:28,100
tablecloth out and you know the flowers

00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:30,440
are still standing right but in terms of

00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,210
finance this is roughly like having an

00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,870
entire beautiful dinner set out and then

00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:37,429
taking the table out right like this is

00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,200
not just some layer of abstract layer

00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:40,789
between the table and we are actually

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,950
taking the table out from under the

00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:45,889
dinner and somehow the tablecloth and

00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:47,000
the dinner just sits there all right the

00:32:45,889 --> 00:32:48,649
thing that kept it off the ground

00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,100
somehow we could take that away and the

00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:53,929
idea of money sunce how is valuable

00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:56,149
enough that the idea of money itself

00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:57,980
stays relevant even though the gold

00:32:56,149 --> 00:33:05,000
backing that money is no longer really

00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:06,679
there yes right right and so then

00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,080
because the interesting part that

00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:12,799
happens after that is that then not only

00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:15,080
do we take not only take the table out

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:17,059
from under the money right then we move

00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,700
away from money being a paper thing at

00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:22,279
all right now money as you say is just

00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,750
bits in an account all right and now we

00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:26,210
have taken not only if we takin the

00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,769
table away then we take the room away

00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,210
and yet somehow at the end of that

00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:31,309
everyone sits down and has a meal and

00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:33,470
feels pretty full which is the most

00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:34,669
remarkable thing right because money at

00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:37,309
a point now where money is just an

00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:38,779
artifact of pure imagination right we

00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:42,470
somehow got from the point where it was

00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:43,880
a rock to it was a dream and everything

00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:45,769
in there still like everything still

00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,080
works we can still buy things like food

00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:50,990
and water and it's magic and I'm gonna

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:54,200
argue that the only reason that works is

00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:57,139
because money solves a lot of problems

00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:00,500
for people and that the success of the

00:33:57,139 --> 00:34:02,899
idea of money matters to a lot of people

00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,909
with a lot of disparate interests

00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:06,950
right and when you're designing whatever

00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:09,319
your organization you intend to build in

00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:11,029
my case Mozilla which I hope you know I

00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:12,859
hope we last a thousand years and we're

00:34:11,029 --> 00:34:14,389
working on that it's in my you know I

00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:15,919
got a line item on my quarterly goals

00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:18,109
and it's in my calendar and stuff make

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,879
organization last a thousand years but

00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:21,649
if you can come up with an ideology if

00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:23,720
you can have an idea that not only

00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:25,970
solves a bunch of real problems for evil

00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:28,970
but also does it in a way that lets

00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:30,069
those people's disparate interests even

00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:32,599
if they're pulling in other directions

00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:34,750
still give rise to that idea and advance

00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:39,230
that idea then you're on the right track

00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:41,119
where we are here alright and the

00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:45,139
institutions are going to go with it the

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:47,899
Bank of England here the 3830 in matts

00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:48,980
the Bank of England here I have it's a

00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:50,779
shame that I don't have it up on the

00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:53,690
screen here the Bank of England has a

00:34:50,779 --> 00:34:55,819
charter all right one of the every bank

00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,230
does well I believe that this is true

00:34:55,819 --> 00:34:59,299
but every bank has a document charter

00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:01,010
because the government of the day

00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:03,470
whatever government it was authorized

00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:05,359
them in some sense to have a document

00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:07,130
saying these are your goals as an

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,079
organization this is the power the

00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:10,640
government is vesting in you and you

00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:13,339
will dispose yourself accordingly in

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,670
this case the government says now know

00:35:13,339 --> 00:35:18,230
ye that we is pardon me in 1694 the

00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:20,180
government said now know ye that we

00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:23,150
being desirous to promote the public

00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:25,279
good and benefit of our people in which

00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:27,230
these presents are chiefly designed and

00:35:25,279 --> 00:35:29,119
intended as well as the prophet and

00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:30,319
advantage of subscribed and contributed

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,430
according to the act of parliament and

00:35:30,319 --> 00:35:32,900
our Commission their oven hairs and

00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:34,579
successors and it goes on like this for

00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,500
two pages and it's all capital letters

00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:39,319
and it's amazing but it also

00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:41,599
circumscribes very clearly what the rule

00:35:39,319 --> 00:35:44,390
of that organization is in advancing

00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,849
this goal the goal of the public good

00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:51,609
the public benefit and supporting the

00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:51,609
currency and sovereignty of England um

00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,609
so have have founding documents this is

00:35:57,349 --> 00:36:00,619
going to be true if it's a religion if

00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:02,809
it's a bank to corporation if it's an

00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:04,339
ideology have something you can point to

00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:07,730
have something you can point to that

00:36:04,339 --> 00:36:08,750
people can read and understand we're

00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:11,569
going to get back to that I minute this

00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:13,160
is uh anyone recognize this one I say

00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:14,510
this a lot like a juno Boost do you

00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,810
notice these are all pictures I found on

00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:18,120
wikipedia

00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:19,680
um have you been to the same Wikipedia

00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,000
articles that I have do you tell

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,000
yourself the same crazy stories about

00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,170
them fantastic go team this is an edge

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,100
case but this is a really interesting

00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:32,270
edge case because these this is a

00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:35,940
picture of group called the shakers

00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:37,890
otherwise called the shaking Quakers the

00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,120
shakers or shaken Quakers were also

00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:40,320
called the longer name for them that

00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,300
they called themselves was the United

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,250
Society of believers in Christ 2nd

00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:47,400
appearance as a real it was a religious

00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:50,220
sect there founded in the 18th century

00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,360
have been branched off from a much

00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,090
larger Quaker community and then

00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,920
subsequently emigrated to North America

00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:57,930
the interesting thing about shakers is a

00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,850
couple of things not one of which is

00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:01,640
that they got their name shakers from

00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:04,830
there ecstatic dancing during their

00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:06,450
during their ceremonies these actually

00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:08,360
have largely the shakers have largely

00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:12,900
expired there are very few of them left

00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:14,550
but they lasted a good 200 years it's

00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,790
only in the mid 1900s that the last

00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:18,810
shaker communities have sort of tapered

00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:20,790
to the point where there's not going to

00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:23,730
be any more shakers but the interesting

00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:25,800
thing about this is not that they had a

00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:27,750
community that lasted 200 years and it's

00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,760
not that they're expiring his community

00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:34,460
the interesting thing is that one of the

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,460
core tenets of their belief is celibacy

00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:43,410
right so where do all these new people

00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:45,510
come from and how do they last and it

00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:47,610
turns and it turns out that this is an

00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:50,400
inch case but it's an informative edge

00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:53,700
case because if your idea is compelling

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,010
enough if you can tell narrative stories

00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,570
about how if you can tell stories that

00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:00,690
are interesting enough to people about

00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:02,490
why your ideology why your organization

00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:04,080
why your set of beliefs are going to

00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,820
make their lives better how they're

00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:09,840
going to be happier to participate in it

00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:11,700
you don't even need kids right the story

00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,980
is this this is really important that

00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,720
the story you're telling will be good

00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,520
enough to bring people in that even in

00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,890
the face of what should be a one

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,510
generation and out problem that you can

00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:25,200
still have something that last centuries

00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:27,090
but it is about how well you tell your

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,830
story how will you communicate it and

00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,660
the value that that thing is perceived

00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:32,690
to give to the world

00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:36,170
right this is the worst case scenario in

00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:38,270
a lot of ways for a community for an

00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:41,690
organization a community that has no

00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:45,530
kids in by any reasonable metric should

00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:47,750
not last 30 years right and these people

00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:49,940
have managed to get ten times that far

00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:51,799
just on the strength of a set of beliefs

00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:54,410
and a way of talking about those beliefs

00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:56,180
in ways that people want to join up and

00:38:54,410 --> 00:39:02,650
people want their lives to be better and

00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:05,809
improved thereby right more generally

00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,859
this is how the knowledge is transferred

00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:10,130
this is how knowledge is transferred

00:39:06,859 --> 00:39:11,660
this is how believers come from you this

00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:13,460
is where believers come from his

00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:16,490
believers in stories secrets died and

00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:19,400
they die hard and they stay dead when

00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:21,890
they do right more generally speaking

00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,210
secrets built on top of other secrets is

00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:25,670
something we see again and again

00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:27,530
something that ends fast and it's a hard

00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:29,329
time coming back and we've seen this

00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:31,940
this is not an artifact of some distant

00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:35,029
past right in your generation we have

00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:36,559
seen legacy hardware die off that no one

00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:38,869
just because no one knows how to fix it

00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:40,700
because there's no one left right the

00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:42,829
FAA the Federal Aviation Administration

00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:45,559
wanted at one point to upgrade their air

00:39:42,829 --> 00:39:47,029
traffic control systems IBM came back to

00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:48,950
them after a long consultation period

00:39:47,029 --> 00:39:51,440
and just said we can't we have to

00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:52,670
rebuild it from scratch why because

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,069
there is nobody left alive who

00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:57,289
understands it the systems that we built

00:39:55,069 --> 00:39:58,760
in the 40s and 50s to do this job no

00:39:57,289 --> 00:40:01,069
longer have an institutional knowledge

00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,210
left we don't have the documentation we

00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:04,309
don't have the brains we're not have the

00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:05,809
talent anymore we have no way to look

00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:06,829
into that stuff and no even what's wrong

00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:09,200
like we don't even know where to start

00:40:06,829 --> 00:40:10,849
we have to rebuild them again because we

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,390
have these black box systems that nobody

00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:17,180
can fix in 2007 the US government

00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:20,750
started overhauling a nation national

00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:22,339
stockpile of nuclear missiles right now

00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:24,829
it turns out you would think that that's

00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:26,420
high-stakes tough right we should keep

00:40:24,829 --> 00:40:28,880
track of documents around nuclear

00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:31,880
missiles that sounds important to me and

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,990
yet when they go to refresh this line of

00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,789
stuff and make sure that they are safe

00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:36,049
make sure that they are going to last

00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:37,930
for another years and make sure that

00:40:36,049 --> 00:40:41,900
we've got enough fissile material

00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:43,010
they've realized permian that the

00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,960
National Nuclear

00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:47,110
security administration realized that

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,580
they could not actually produce a

00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:52,010
material that was critical to their

00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:55,070
operation material at the time was

00:40:52,010 --> 00:41:02,570
called fog bank um was the code name for

00:40:55,070 --> 00:41:05,300
it and code name was all they had right

00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:07,820
so we've got on the one hand we've got

00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:09,500
an atomic bomb and on the other hand

00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:11,690
we've got a knowledge that there is a

00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:14,750
material in there called fog bank that

00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:18,130
is important we don't know why it's

00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:20,960
called that I don't want to open that

00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:23,060
look at it right and so all this

00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,950
information like this is not a unique

00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:27,590
phenomenon in the history history is

00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:30,710
merciless to this but it happens all the

00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:33,380
time all right a generation of

00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:38,990
scientists of technicians of librarians

00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:42,680
of people of church leaders of community

00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:45,620
leaders finance ears entrepreneurs

00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:49,490
generation goes away and the information

00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:51,350
they had goes with them right so that

00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:52,610
brings us back to this how are you going

00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:57,950
to build an organization lasts a

00:41:52,610 --> 00:42:00,340
thousand years right so a couple of

00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:03,710
things that seem to be universally true

00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:06,680
not always but seem to be one of them is

00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:08,690
do you have a set of principal documents

00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,220
do you have a thing you can point to

00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:12,470
that says this is the starting point

00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:14,750
these are our values these are our goals

00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:17,690
these are our principles are those

00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:19,670
documents accessible can you get someone

00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:21,590
who has not been a part of your

00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:23,960
organization in the past to look at

00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:26,540
those documents and say I'm excited by

00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:29,540
this I want to be a part of this are you

00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:31,100
evangelizing right do you are you

00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,510
evangelizing those documents do you have

00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,220
outreach efforts to go to the world and

00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:38,630
say we believe that these things are

00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:41,150
important and this is why um does this

00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:43,910
thing whatever your thing is our case

00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:47,420
it's the open web could be anything for

00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:50,840
you from food safety to food supply it

00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:52,670
could be traveling to the moon musk has

00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:56,000
a thousand-year mission to get us to

00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:58,760
Mars this is all very exciting stuff

00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,470
um do you have a way to get people

00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,970
excited you have a way to get people to

00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:03,050
self-identify as being part of your

00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:06,250
organization and maybe more importantly

00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:09,590
is your leadership of this organization

00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:11,000
widely distributed is more than one

00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:12,710
group of people trying to be a part of

00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,880
this or leading a group in some region

00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:18,020
that is trying to be a part of your

00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:20,030
efforts um and are you only loosely

00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:22,550
coupled to the point of origin right

00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:25,040
like if Mozilla goes away what happens

00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:27,620
if Mozilla is you know if our All Hands

00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,780
gets hit by an airplane then people who

00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:31,580
still believe in what we believe can go

00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,950
to our website can go to our source code

00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:36,380
can get that can take that part of the

00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:37,370
organization and we spin it and turn it

00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,590
into something new and it won't be

00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:45,530
exactly what we had before but my hope

00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:47,180
is that the dream lives on right and a

00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:49,160
good way to figure out if you are only

00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:50,270
if your goals if you're real mission is

00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,830
only loosely coupled to your

00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:53,780
organization is to ask yourself what

00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:55,100
happens if another one shows up what

00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:57,050
happens if someone else shows up and

00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,220
says that they're the real ones says

00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,900
that they're the real Mozilla if another

00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,760
organization shows up and says this is

00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,230
you know we believe in the open open web

00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,600
and we're Mozilla too and we're taking

00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:07,880
it from here does that make you hat does

00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,990
that make you happy right are you sad

00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,280
and angry that someone is trying to take

00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:12,560
the throne from you or are you just like

00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,630
go team great fantastic now there's more

00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,280
than one of us that's amazing if you can

00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:18,260
say that if you can get to a point where

00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:21,470
that is not only true but it's

00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:25,670
pervasively true then you're winning

00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:26,870
right so why does open source matter

00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:29,960
this is what I come back to and I'm

00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:32,480
having conversations like this is open

00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,310
source matters because if we build the

00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,160
society we have on top of these secrets

00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:39,320
then eventually it's going away that's

00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,270
all there is to it secrets die off and

00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,640
if we build the things that we care

00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:46,430
about on top of them if we build our

00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:49,250
infrastructure if we build our society

00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:50,870
if we build all these things on top of

00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:52,220
things that we can't understand you're

00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:54,440
looking to and eventually those things

00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:56,330
go away then things like democracy and

00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:01,060
justice and human decency are going to

00:44:56,330 --> 00:45:01,060
be really really hard to rebuild right

00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,339
so

00:45:02,789 --> 00:45:06,839
sit your victory condition here and i

00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:08,369
hope you aspire to the kind of

00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:11,549
megalomania that I'm describing in this

00:45:08,369 --> 00:45:14,939
but your victory condition here is a

00:45:11,549 --> 00:45:17,189
world where a whole lot of people grow

00:45:14,939 --> 00:45:20,099
up thinking that this is just the way it

00:45:17,189 --> 00:45:21,869
is right of course you can see into your

00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:23,039
source code of course you can open of

00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:24,599
course you can open a laptop and then

00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:25,949
figure out how it works it's always been

00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:27,239
like that what kind of animal lives in

00:45:25,949 --> 00:45:29,989
an environment where you can't use open

00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:32,459
source technology that's savagery right

00:45:29,989 --> 00:45:34,589
in a whole generation of people who grow

00:45:32,459 --> 00:45:37,949
up just thinking that that's normal

00:45:34,589 --> 00:45:40,289
right we're almost there right now with

00:45:37,949 --> 00:45:41,759
the web right we've got a generation of

00:45:40,289 --> 00:45:44,519
people who are growing up right now

00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:47,519
insisting on transparency insisting on

00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:50,449
the kind of connected activism that the

00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:52,619
web and open source make possible um

00:45:50,449 --> 00:45:54,569
black lives matter is one great example

00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:56,339
among many of people who are leveraging

00:45:54,569 --> 00:45:59,219
network technologies to change the world

00:45:56,339 --> 00:46:01,799
there are thousands of others right and

00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:03,599
if we enable that world if we can keep

00:46:01,799 --> 00:46:05,400
that trend going than this world of

00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,069
small loosely join pieces that can

00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,969
collaborate to make great things I think

00:46:08,069 --> 00:46:12,929
it's going to last and I hope that I

00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:14,489
hope you can put my brain in a jar and

00:46:12,929 --> 00:46:17,059
we all get there to see it thank you

00:46:14,489 --> 00:46:17,059
very much for your time

00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:23,099
I always have this feeling at the end of

00:46:21,869 --> 00:46:25,829
talks like this where I have to say okay

00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:27,989
now did that make any sense did that

00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:33,239
make a lick of sense to anyone I hope

00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:34,559
that it did this kind of thing being

00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:36,359
with a plan for the really long term

00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:38,219
here is I think that's something we

00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:39,420
should at least aspire to I know it

00:46:38,219 --> 00:46:41,130
can't be a part of your weekly planning

00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:42,390
or your quarterly goals you know and it

00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:44,670
can't be on your calendar for next week

00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:46,499
but keep your eye on that ball like

00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:48,779
whatever organization that you end up

00:46:46,499 --> 00:46:51,269
working for founding or starting or

00:46:48,779 --> 00:46:53,789
being a part of keep an eye on the idea

00:46:51,269 --> 00:46:55,799
that maybe it should last and maybe it

00:46:53,789 --> 00:46:58,949
should matter a long after any one

00:46:55,799 --> 00:47:01,910
person who's there has gone thanks very

00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:01,910
much for your time it's been a privilege

00:47:09,769 --> 00:47:14,819
51 minutes Oh didn't have any questions

00:47:12,809 --> 00:47:18,539
every comments one on one in the back

00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:21,029
yes what do I think about Bitcoin yeah

00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:25,229
um my feelings are conflicted about

00:47:21,029 --> 00:47:28,769
Bitcoin there's two things I think about

00:47:25,229 --> 00:47:31,140
Bitcoin one is that the idea of a

00:47:28,769 --> 00:47:33,299
consensus transaction record is really

00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:36,599
compelling and the idea that you will

00:47:33,299 --> 00:47:40,349
have a a space where it is not possible

00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:43,140
to arbitrarily make claims that are not

00:47:40,349 --> 00:47:45,269
backed out that are not verified in some

00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:47,099
way that there is a codified consensus

00:47:45,269 --> 00:47:50,219
reality system for a system that's

00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:52,769
really interesting around history around

00:47:50,219 --> 00:47:55,140
storing the source as a source of truth

00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:57,809
it's really um it's a compelling idea

00:47:55,140 --> 00:48:00,539
there are also problems with the like

00:47:57,809 --> 00:48:04,049
who was that fellow the fellow who

00:48:00,539 --> 00:48:06,269
actually created a Bitcoin farm a little

00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:07,410
while ago and suddenly had 51 percent of

00:48:06,269 --> 00:48:09,030
the blockchain under his

00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:12,150
fifty-nine percent of the CPU power and

00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:16,470
then just quietly sort of agreed not to

00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:19,650
do that that was scary I think that um

00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:21,089
the Bitcoin as a transactional model is

00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:23,309
much more important than Bitcoin the

00:48:21,089 --> 00:48:27,960
currency I think the Bitcoin the

00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:29,250
currency is some well I usually have a

00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,170
lot of profanity in mind when I talk

00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:32,910
about Bitcoin currency but i think that

00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:44,280
bitcoin the truth model has a lot going

00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:46,559
for it yes oh and pardon me quite the

00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,119
opposite I think I think that a Fiat I

00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,710
think if y'all currencies are awesome I

00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:52,109
think that there I think that they are

00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:55,020
almost magic in how well they work and

00:48:52,109 --> 00:48:56,250
how there are enough people pulling on

00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:58,470
the incentives in different directions

00:48:56,250 --> 00:49:02,250
that they stay relatively stable

00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:05,400
globally I think that there are um there

00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:07,740
are there are very very strange there

00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,849
are very very strange thing like that I

00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:10,140
don't know how else to explain it there

00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:11,640
are very very weird thing and it's

00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:14,210
amazing that it manages to work as well

00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:18,210
as it does but they off they also offer

00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:20,819
tools and they offer society's tools to

00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:22,799
take advantage of them and to leverage

00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:24,180
what money is in the nature of light in

00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:26,640
ways that are actually generally

00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:27,720
beneficial to society and I don't think

00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,789
that there any worse than backed

00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,589
currency is like a bitcoin is not

00:49:29,789 --> 00:49:34,349
bitcoin is a backed currency right

00:49:31,589 --> 00:49:36,359
bitcoin is it's its currency that's

00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:39,869
backed with scarce hashes rather than

00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:42,839
gold and I don't know that that makes in

00:49:39,869 --> 00:49:46,049
false it falls prey in that sense to all

00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:47,760
the same failures that made a shift away

00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:51,900
from Bitcoin or that made have shift

00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,950
away from from back old currencies so I

00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,750
think that there's a lot of problems

00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:56,099
with Bitcoin the currency mall even

00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:58,710
though i like the bitcoin historical

00:49:56,099 --> 00:50:01,380
record mall yes

00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:08,300
common the reasoning one of the

00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:08,300
advantage to be a currency the actually

00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:21,540
yeah also it's worth paying attention to

00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:24,180
it's worth paying attention to the

00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:25,500
people who tell you to buy gold the

00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:28,470
people who tell you that you should buy

00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:29,760
gold are usually telling you to buy it

00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:34,200
because they want you to be afraid of

00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:36,690
things like this is that American pundit

00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:42,540
you know who I'm talking about um pardon

00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:44,880
me no not Peter Schiff he's that glenn

00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:46,950
beck glenn beck and one of the people

00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,830
that tells you you only buy gold when

00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:51,089
you're terrified and you only buy gold

00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:52,500
because you expect that the people

00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:54,470
you're going to sell it to later are

00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:56,190
going to be more scared than you and

00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:57,599
because that's the only way it's going

00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:58,740
to increase in value right otherwise it

00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:02,490
just sits there on the ground so rock

00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:04,290
but the that cycle i think is

00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:05,670
problematic for a lot of ways not the

00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:06,960
least of which is that I think it would

00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:10,349
be good if a lot of people were less

00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:15,619
afraid and gold as a back standard

00:51:10,349 --> 00:51:15,619
incentivizes fear yes

00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:25,559
an actual pervasive success

00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:29,619
yeah I think of an example of that is

00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:32,650
democracy got sort of good in Canada the

00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:34,660
US and a generation didn't realize what

00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:40,980
the dangers were to it and we've

00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:40,980
accepted budget in said we shouldn't

00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:48,309
people work against democracy we don't

00:51:45,069 --> 00:51:49,839
realize how they are actually violating

00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:53,920
the convention

00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:55,660
I think that I think one of the failure

00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,369
modes of democracy is people can ask for

00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:59,049
self that they maybe didn't want and

00:51:57,369 --> 00:52:03,519
then get it good and hard in a way that

00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:05,440
they didn't expect and that's that is I

00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:06,719
think not a failure of democracy as a

00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,729
whole I think it might be a failure of

00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:13,029
first-past-the-post democracy and the

00:52:09,729 --> 00:52:14,170
notion that if a democracy is not it

00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:15,969
doesn't make an effort to be more

00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:17,349
broadly representative and more merciful

00:52:15,969 --> 00:52:20,309
to people who are on the minority side

00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:23,259
that if a society gets to a point where

00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:25,749
thus you know where the majority thinks

00:52:23,259 --> 00:52:27,940
that taking from the minority is okay I

00:52:25,749 --> 00:52:30,969
don't know how many actual government

00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:33,549
systems are going to in the long term

00:52:30,969 --> 00:52:35,319
stop that from happening I think that in

00:52:33,549 --> 00:52:37,269
the you know more representative think

00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:39,880
there's a chance to slow that electoral

00:52:37,269 --> 00:52:41,680
cycle but you do need a set of

00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,619
institutions that remain committed to

00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,700
that electoral cycle rather than trying

00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:47,910
to find an alternative system of

00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,910
government

00:52:47,930 --> 00:53:02,570
various people in power because they're

00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:04,010
actually recommending system with

00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:05,540
individual decisions which you're

00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:08,390
talking about and I think matter a lot

00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:10,610
some of people taking the system for

00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:14,060
granted

00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:14,060
protect the system

00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:22,480
so I don't think there's an answer to

00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:26,370
that that I'm going to get through in

00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:29,080
the next two minutes and 25 seconds I

00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:31,480
have a lot of conflicting feelings about

00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:35,230
that around things like intent and human

00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:36,190
rights and government and like that just

00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:37,750
the fact that they're called human

00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:39,940
rights because you're not supposed to be

00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:42,010
able to take them away and yet sometimes

00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:44,530
this law comes along with does that and

00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:47,230
how and how there's a lag in our system

00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:48,790
that allows that a lot to be created and

00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:50,860
then it takes a long time to get

00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:53,440
challenged and the laudable supper at

00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:55,090
any time um I would like to have a

00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:58,360
longer conversation about that but not

00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:59,350
in the next minute and 50 seconds I'm

00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,260
sorry does anyone else have any

00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:03,790
questions or comments on here listen I'm

00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:07,230
grateful again fold your time and thanks

00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:07,230
