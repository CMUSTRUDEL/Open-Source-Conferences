was Gregg Allman once stated he took a

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,740
thousand people randomly and just put

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,490
them into the city that they had no clue

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,139
to live that the musicians that are just

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,980
a small trash would be the first people

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:19,680
to congregate and stone community I like

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,689
to think that that that's true for the

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:30,869
first time I'm noticing that linux and

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:34,160
music that has appeared twice we like to

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:37,739
present the afternoon presentation for

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:42,239
sauce and to introduce you to blaze a

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:45,120
lean blaze is a graduate university

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,670
trong patchwork science with what it was

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,940
and what background found

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,699
a member of Planet libre very fun

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,680
graduation center and plus an extensive

00:00:53,699 --> 00:01:00,059
musical background from what I gather

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,760
you've created a nice cool rig here but

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:06,750
not only are you demonstrate to us but

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,119
has been used before in productions

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,820
including the CDC which is that order to

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,450
do some fellows CT v yep part of it part

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:19,590
of a lady and a fascinating place I met

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:22,470
last year because I did a music very

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,520
keen amazing individual so without any

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,520
further ado alike

00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,380
you

00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,830
meet you

00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,020
she

00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,970
you

00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:32,069
you

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,900
you

00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,830
love you

00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:18,010
so many wires and that was a song by

00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:19,810
song writer named alexi murdoch and song

00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,930
i had to listen to a lot recently a

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:26,410
favorite of mine and one of the first

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:29,890
songs that i tried as a solo artist on

00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:35,700
my life he's a great because it's such a

00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:37,690
raw bear acoustic track but on the

00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:42,070
recorded version there was just the

00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:45,730
soundscape behind it and that was that

00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:50,080
was the first song I tried to arrange

00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:54,310
here to create that soundscape live so

00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:57,580
um I'll walk you through what I did to

00:10:54,310 --> 00:11:05,350
create that song as an entry point into

00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:08,100
this live music Rick so we had three

00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,100
instruments going

00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:16,700
the thin is what somewhere

00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,820
well there is the synth

00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,870
oh I needed that would do it

00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:45,660
so the synth was the first instrument

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:51,269
that's coming from my MIDI keyboard

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:58,120
plugged in via USB and going through a

00:11:51,269 --> 00:12:02,050
software synth called yoshimi so this

00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:04,269
allows me the midi controller sends midi

00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:08,110
notes and i can play any kind make any

00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:12,940
kind of sounds with that and so i picked

00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:25,740
one that worked for that Thun and the

00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:34,000
next sound was the guitar now the guitar

00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:36,100
is going through my pedalboard here but

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,769
I'm I'm only actually using one of the

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,930
effects which is the pitch shifter to

00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:44,319
get those slides and to get it up high

00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:45,270
all the other sound processing is taking

00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:55,400
place in

00:12:45,270 --> 00:13:01,440
Rock Iraq here on the computer with this

00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:05,790
angel chorus sound so I can get all

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:15,120
kinds of different sounds out of this

00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:23,250
for example it's pretty straight sound

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:25,650
or so with guitars feeding through there

00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:31,110
and that's what's coloring it with all

00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:40,560
of those effects and then the violin was

00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:44,760
just going raw so what I wanted the

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,230
violin was just going to raw but all of

00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,410
these tracks were going through super

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:54,660
looper which is a kind of digital audio

00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:56,280
workstation for live looping so three

00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,700
tracks their violins in the middle right

00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,950
so I lay down one track and then I just

00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,360
layer some violin on top of it and

00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:06,090
that's the same thing i did with a synth

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,720
and the same thing that I did with the

00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,720
guitar um

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:19,149
this pedal i just bought a couple days

00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:20,950
ago because the last time i was trying

00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,630
to do this for a presentation a month

00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:25,390
month back for software freedom day in

00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:27,459
toronto I was clicking everything so

00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:30,190
this is the midi foot controller so it

00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:35,050
also plugs into a USB but i can program

00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:38,260
this so that this plays starts and stops

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:40,540
the loops or at the beginning when i was

00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,459
looking really confused there i started

00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,080
the violin loop but i was playing guitar

00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:45,100
so there's nothing coming out after i

00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,950
finished I was trying to figure out

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,959
what's going on so luckily I programmed

00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,520
the undo button into the pedal tube so I

00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:54,250
was able to just rewrite and just accept

00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:59,980
that and so this gets me a lot of the

00:14:54,250 --> 00:15:01,839
software controls but um at within reach

00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:07,930
of my feet so I don't need to be on my

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:11,380
laptop when I'm performing there are

00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:13,930
some other really cool things like for

00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:16,420
example well let's step down the stack

00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:21,339
so they're all going in in a super

00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:22,930
looper but before that i'm using jack

00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:25,600
which you would have heard about if you

00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:28,660
are at the presentation earlier at home

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,670
recording jack is the audio server for

00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,430
professional audio and good new linux

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:36,250
and it's available for an OS 10 as well

00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:38,709
so this is my jack patchbay and using a

00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:42,820
program called Katya and you can see

00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:45,310
that all the blue our audio inputs all

00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:48,070
the red or MIDI so all these

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:50,680
applications that are Jack aware can

00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,420
define any number of audio inputs and

00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:57,670
outputs any number of MIDI inputs and

00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:59,350
outputs so I have coming in from my

00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:02,079
launch key the midi keyboard that goes

00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:04,060
into yoshimi and then that audio goes

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,970
into loop number one a super looper and

00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:10,390
out to my keyboard bass amp which is

00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:14,290
playback one and the guitar comes in

00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:16,180
from capture two into rock Iraq and then

00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:18,130
rocco's in a loop too and that goes into

00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,760
my electric guitar amp and the violin

00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,560
and captured

00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,180
just go straight in and then straight

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,650
out to my kataria and my foot pedal and

00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:29,050
it's sending MIDI signals to super

00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:31,150
looper for this so I can stop it but i

00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:33,700
also have it plugged into iraq iraq so i

00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:38,530
could change the effects with my foot as

00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:42,850
well so this is a graphical interface

00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:45,120
for Jack and when you're setting up the

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:47,410
new linux audio there can be a lot of

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,110
complicated stuff so one of the easiest

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:52,990
things to do is to find an audio distro

00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:54,670
that does a lot of that for you so I

00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:58,180
went to studio was the first one that I

00:16:54,670 --> 00:17:02,200
used and more recently there's KX to do

00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:06,730
and AV linux what I'm doing now is I'm

00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:09,130
running just running debian Jessie but I

00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:11,290
have the KX to do repositories so KX

00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:13,810
studio offers a complete distro but also

00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:16,000
repositories for debian and ubuntu so

00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:17,740
with the KX to do repositories i have

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,790
the latest greatest audio production

00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:25,780
software and some of the kind of preset

00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:28,630
configuration things and the only thing

00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,830
i had to get on my own was a low latency

00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,760
kernel which i got from the liquor

00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:35,770
Rick's project so install that Colonel

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,970
install the KX to do repositories and

00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,260
I'm good to go in debian though if

00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:41,140
you're starting brush it's worth looking

00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:42,550
at KX to do proper or ad linux or flinch

00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,290
to do something that's going to create

00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:47,580
configure the system so you don't need

00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:50,890
to fight with this the first time and

00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:53,880
then coming down to the lower hardware

00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:57,490
level for professional audio production

00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,530
you want to have an audio interface to

00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:01,150
replace your onboard sound card so this

00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:03,370
is the one that I'm using here and

00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,630
that's what Jack is communicating with

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,610
so that's where I get my two system

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,770
inputs my two system outputs where I've

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:13,280
got my master volume going into the amps

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:15,440
and for a lot of his hardware

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,900
the key thing that you're looking for is

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,150
whether or not it's USB class compliant

00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,950
if it's USB class compliant you don't

00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:23,990
need any fancy drivers for it you don't

00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:26,780
need any prior Terry drivers it's going

00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,770
to work wet very likely to work well can

00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,900
give you a linux oh i have a class

00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:32,270
compliant audio interface a class

00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:35,300
compliant midi keyboard a class

00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:38,540
compliant midi 8 foot controller so they

00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:47,540
all are plug and play with Jack and

00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:53,240
guinea linux yeah musicians marry with

00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:55,190
programs right okay mr. Stoker disaster

00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,410
recovery like have you ever had a

00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:01,100
problem with some technology whatever a

00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:04,390
little glitch happy your life how do you

00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:07,550
how do you deal if you have you ever had

00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:09,770
yeah well I'm still relatively new in

00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,630
performed setting to using the system so

00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:13,430
that's something that I'm like that's

00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:15,110
why I program the unlike like I

00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:17,450
programmed for buttons into the

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:23,210
controller two days ago and undo was one

00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:25,610
of them but yeah when I was on and CTV

00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:27,170
Canada am in March I was accompanying

00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,820
other artists that I play with I didn't

00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:31,670
have the whole rig I just had the

00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:33,500
keyboard and a laptop and a sound card I

00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,090
was there during soundcheck like

00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,550
checking a million times I cocaine still

00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,190
working are you still working ok and

00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:41,970
then

00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:43,830
yeah make sure and was my Asian diluted

00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:48,080
right and but he was just an appliance

00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:50,519
it's simple it probably not an IT

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,830
literate guy but he's a talented

00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:54,509
musician uses what he uses to create a

00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:57,029
big sign out of the back of Brighton

00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:59,519
stage but you've got lots of complexity

00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:02,220
there which is great to see that

00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:05,129
marriage but it also creates some

00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:09,240
potential exposure yeah it's it's it's a

00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:10,620
it's a total exposure in that way it has

00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,419
to be something that I that I need to be

00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:15,450
a very good to tell shoot with live

00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:17,129
looping though a lot of the

00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:20,940
troubleshooting is more to do with

00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:22,590
workflow than technology so if I have

00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,500
the right like I have to do some extra

00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:26,759
work to program the right buttons in her

00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,750
super looper versus if I had a

00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:31,980
self-contained looping device but a lot

00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,529
of the troubleshooting his work flow

00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,000
like if you need to redo a loop what do

00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:37,200
you do in different contexts and that's

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,320
something that I'm still new to in

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,669
learning but when I've seen other people

00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:45,419
do that like like one of when I've been

00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:47,730
on I was on tour with somebody who was

00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:50,700
doing a lot of live looping with his

00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:51,659
cello and you know he was he got a new

00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,649
pedal so he's practicing during

00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:54,629
soundcheck so didn't hit the wrong

00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:56,789
button but like it's just a workflow

00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:58,230
thing so that you know if you make this

00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:05,220
mistake in this context what are your

00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:07,080
options for the steps yeah yeah yeah

00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,250
yeah and it's different depending on the

00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,250
kind of thing you're doing like with an

00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:13,080
atmospheric loop like that it doesn't

00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,940
need to be so precise the loops don't

00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,639
need to be in sync I want them to be out

00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:20,940
of sync right I want them to mixing in a

00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:23,220
different way but a song that'll play in

00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:26,820
a little bit is a much tighter loop so

00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:28,559
we'll see how that one goes um let me

00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:33,720
demo a little bit more of this software

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:36,090
so one of the so this this is really

00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,490
alpha state like I've used pieces of

00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:40,230
this before in production but this is a

00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,570
very new thing this is the second time

00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,929
that I brought this whole raid out

00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:48,360
together somewhere

00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:51,039
and one of the things that I am

00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:55,990
gradually learning to do is to put more

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:58,210
and more control at my fingertips and

00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:01,029
trying to figure out what controls I

00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:03,340
actually need so for exam so this is

00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:07,230
another synth program that I was using

00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:10,299
and I've got some knobs and sliders on

00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:25,779
my launch key midi controller as well

00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:27,249
and so if we grab say this i am playing

00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:29,649
in a band that's just in the early

00:22:27,249 --> 00:22:32,860
stages of jamming so it may or may not

00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:35,860
be a thing but trying to get some

00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,789
control here you know mid-song with the

00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,029
song we were working on a couple of

00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:39,029
weeks ago

00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:51,539
I programmed some things like the

00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:53,789
portamento to to the keyboard so I have

00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:55,469
at my fingertips like to the midi

00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:58,249
keyboard so i don't have to go back to

00:22:55,469 --> 00:23:00,809
my laptop so i can be i can have a

00:22:58,249 --> 00:23:09,659
little bit of that slide sound right

00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:11,099
like drop it out just have something

00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:13,469
straight and clear so something that i

00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:22,199
can adjust a second or even drive right

00:23:13,469 --> 00:23:24,269
so I could kick in and like just having

00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:25,979
some of that control my fingertips it's

00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:28,229
it's more work when you don't buy a

00:23:25,979 --> 00:23:29,969
self-contained box that has all that

00:23:28,229 --> 00:23:31,349
thought that goes into getting a preset

00:23:29,969 --> 00:23:33,079
the kind of thing that I'm doing is I'm

00:23:31,349 --> 00:23:35,549
looking at okay what are the preset and

00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:37,769
things have what kind of controls do

00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:39,059
people need at their fingertips and what

00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:41,009
kind of controls do I want at my

00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:43,069
fingertips my workflow and started early

00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:46,439
just in the early stages of kind of

00:23:43,069 --> 00:23:49,649
adjusting and getting those settings one

00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:51,749
of the other really neat things is when

00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:55,469
you bring the laptop in the mix is the

00:23:51,749 --> 00:23:58,259
decoupling of the controller from the

00:23:55,469 --> 00:24:00,059
sound processing so when you have a midi

00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:01,619
controller you're playing the notes on

00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:03,929
one device but the sound is being

00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:05,099
processed in another so i just switched

00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:10,859
to a totally different software

00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:12,449
application with it opens up the

00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:16,889
potential for a lot of interesting

00:24:12,449 --> 00:24:21,059
things so for example with a rock iraq

00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:23,069
also so there's software since with

00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:27,169
generate which generate a sound but

00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:33,970
there are also sound processors which

00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:37,610
modify a sound so um this

00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:41,960
is both of those things at the same time

00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:47,350
so I can take my violin and put it

00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:47,350
through a sound processor like rock Iraq

00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:59,240
except I have to put it through a sound

00:24:53,270 --> 00:25:01,539
processor like Rach Rach Rach Rach where

00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,539
are you

00:25:07,389 --> 00:25:18,239
so let's adjust this effect so it is all

00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:18,239
wet no dry

00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:38,650
that's really cool and then even cooler

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,360
is this has a software feature to try

00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:44,650
and pick up the MIDI note from the sound

00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:50,830
that's coming in so I can hike the MIDI

00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:52,540
out from rock Iraq so I've got the audio

00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:54,190
going through but I'm going to take the

00:25:52,540 --> 00:26:18,340
MIDI out and I'm going to throw that

00:25:54,190 --> 00:26:20,620
into that am sin so now and it's chaotic

00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:25,840
but it can be controlled so i can adjust

00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:29,670
the the trigger and the velocity i think

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,670
and so

00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:47,180
that's that's that's the kind of stuff

00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,800
that I'm playing around next for the

00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:51,350
future the possibilities of kind of

00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:56,450
anything any input going into any output

00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:58,550
of decoupling the controller from the

00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:02,780
instrument so I can try and harness my

00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:06,350
violin as a as a midi controller that is

00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:13,670
a really cool potential for this for

00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:16,700
this sort of thing when so music and

00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:21,140
technology have been pretty separate for

00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:22,370
me until the last year I I've always

00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:26,750
been interested technology I've always

00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:29,540
been interested in music but there were

00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:31,790
few overlaps between the two except for

00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:34,010
maybe home recording because most of the

00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:36,620
music that I was interested in was more

00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:38,870
analog music more folk music or rock

00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:40,490
music or things like that so I did music

00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,630
over here I did computers over here

00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:43,310
people were like oh you're interested in

00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:46,370
both why don't you techno music and and

00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:50,650
the data that was not interesting to me

00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:53,870
and I've more recently got into EDM but

00:27:50,650 --> 00:28:02,360
before it just those were two separate

00:27:53,870 --> 00:28:05,000
worlds so when in my software life when

00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,710
I discovered you gnu/linux at UofT in a

00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,380
comp side program and then heard Richard

00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:10,730
Stallman speak I turned around left

00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,920
windows behind started replacing

00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,000
everything with free software and then

00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,380
eventually you start getting to the

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,680
specialized programs and that's when I

00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:20,360
hit the recording software and that's

00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,770
when I went to bunch of studio several

00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,620
years back and kind of figured out okay

00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:26,180
how can i set up my home studio and so

00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,730
that i can record but he was that was

00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:30,770
kind of that and but a year ago i

00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:33,920
started looking for keyboards because

00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:35,540
I'm multi-instrumentalist I solo

00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,520
songwriter but I accompanied other

00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,919
songwriters a lot so I'm on violin a

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,739
guitar I thought he would be an ass

00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:44,669
to be able to have a keyboard and maybe

00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:48,100
a piano at home things like that and I

00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:49,570
started looking into them and my frame

00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,919
of reference at first was the Nords

00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,679
because they're like you know the

00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:54,909
ultimate kind of stage piano keyboard

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,499
and be nice to have something that has

00:28:54,909 --> 00:29:01,570
piano sounds but also since but but

00:28:58,499 --> 00:29:04,720
that's when I really opened my eyes

00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:06,190
committee because I had just had this

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,929
misconception about videos you know

00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:09,700
cheap computer sounds before and I

00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:11,470
realized that it's more of an any input

00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:14,049
to any output kind of universal language

00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:15,869
and all of the sudden when I discovered

00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:19,960
that and i discovered the free software

00:29:15,869 --> 00:29:22,509
options for working with it the nord

00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,909
just started looking like a big mac book

00:29:22,509 --> 00:29:27,009
like this kind of you know device that's

00:29:24,909 --> 00:29:29,950
shiny and works really well and is a

00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:31,749
little overpriced but you can't tinker

00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:36,039
with it you can't get inside it's a big

00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:38,230
black box so that's when I totally shift

00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:41,609
shift it and went to the midi route and

00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:48,730
just stow headfirst into the new linux

00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:50,499
audio and the idea to create the live

00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,820
music station i'm starting to do this in

00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:56,440
terms of a keyboard i should also demo

00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:58,499
another kind of program i show you sound

00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,659
processors to modify the sound and

00:29:58,499 --> 00:30:03,999
software synthesizers to generate a

00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:14,009
sound from the computer but there are

00:30:03,999 --> 00:30:19,239
also there are also samplers and so

00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:22,059
samplers allow midi notes to trigger the

00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:26,499
sound but in a place back pre-recorded

00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:32,169
audio so i can use the sampler to make

00:30:26,499 --> 00:30:38,700
my midi controller play the piano as

00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:38,700
well so if we do this

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,980
so I realized I'm a controller i would

00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:54,500
have all these options combined with my

00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:57,710
laptop instead of buying all these

00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,850
specialized piece of hardware that could

00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:00,860
do one thing really well but you

00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:03,530
couldn't really transform into something

00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:05,870
else same with the with the controller

00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:09,980
this was expensive purchase earlier this

00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:12,260
week but this this can replace like this

00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:14,570
can be a looping pedal this can control

00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:17,360
guitar effects this is serve multiple

00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:20,120
purposes it's not one dedicated piece of

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,600
hardware that and that does only one

00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:26,150
thing I can I can reconfigure it to do

00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:32,059
multiple things and to serve multiple

00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:36,280
purposes so when I started realizing

00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:39,080
that as a multi-instrumentalist and as

00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:40,880
as a solo artist I started thinking

00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,610
about the potential of bringing this

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,170
together and bringing it out like I I've

00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,580
spent the entire day today carting

00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:50,480
around half the contents of my apartment

00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:53,150
here but being able to do that right to

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,250
to bring my studio out from home live

00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:57,860
with me on a stage to be able to

00:31:55,250 --> 00:32:00,170
accompany myself to lay down a sound

00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:02,690
scape like that the kind of thing that I

00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:06,860
was already doing in the studio but I

00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:08,809
saw a way to do it live and I saw way to

00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:11,660
do it as as a sideman like it in this

00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:14,809
band that and that we're just at the jam

00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:20,030
stage now it's a five-piece we have

00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:22,040
vocals bass drums kind of more

00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:25,730
traditional electric guitar keys and my

00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:27,710
role is like computers like I'm the IBM

00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:29,179
which is never a role that hug before

00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:32,120
I'm usually the violinist or maybe the

00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:33,860
guitars but I'm kind of like the Swiss

00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,630
Army knife of special ops and other

00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:38,420
kinds of sounds right so bringing all

00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:41,390
this kind of stuff and being able to to

00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:46,550
do a wide variety of things and and to

00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:48,410
have a setup that I can separate a bit

00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,910
like I don't need to I don't need to

00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:52,130
bring the whole set up everywhere I

00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:54,230
could just bring the keyboard I could

00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:55,210
just have the foot controller to be able

00:32:54,230 --> 00:33:05,409
to loop

00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:09,039
guitar and for example oh yeah let me

00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:15,059
play it let me play a couple songs to

00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:15,059
show this concretely

00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,640
so

00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:57,210
this next tune is called Candace's this

00:33:53,790 --> 00:34:00,780
is the first original tune that I

00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:04,530
started arranging for this setup and by

00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:11,780
arranging for this setup I mean last

00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:14,580
night and I i think when i get more

00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:18,740
comfortable with the gear i'll probably

00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:23,360
do more what it shows at least what's

00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:23,360
already possible at a simple level

00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:18,110
I also set a place in free culture tune

00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:20,080
so the first one wasn't cover but this

in minute I'll be there make it worth

00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:57,829
way

00:35:58,309 --> 00:36:08,009
rest your head in my sleeping for get

00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:17,119
time say you're always mine I'll be

00:36:08,009 --> 00:36:17,119
there you're gorgeous in this light

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:31,920
reflections in your eyes someone need to

00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:35,690
like celebrate your smile witness beauty

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,690
of your race

00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:58,680
all these unknown voices calling out

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:58,680
your name I create her drink instead

00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:14,630
and strength to mediate all of your day

00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:20,700
you might be repaid

00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:20,680
you

00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:33,780
to me all your pain

00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:47,330
yummy

00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:22,350
hey um let me show you a few demos for

00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:26,120
where I see a few videos for the kinds

00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:28,290
of things that I see as next steps

00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,680
moving forward and then I'll play one

00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,680
last song

00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:47,150
so first of all I have never I've never

00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:50,000
done any hardware hacking before and

00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:53,690
I've never had any real interest beyond

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,200
curiosity about the Arduino until I saw

00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:56,200
this

00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:29,050
so he's not using free software he's

00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:31,870
using a max/msp on a Mac he's using free

00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:34,270
hardware and the point is it's it's he's

00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:36,340
doing two things one he's put controls

00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:40,630
at his fingertips on guitar so we could

00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:44,470
start a loop he's got he's got drum

00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:46,750
samplers there so one that's MIDI

00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:49,750
controls at his fingers but to the

00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:51,790
second thing he did is his guitar was

00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:53,980
going through the proprietary sound

00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:57,700
processing program to get the effects

00:41:53,980 --> 00:42:01,030
and he was modulating he was modifying

00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:04,060
that effect from the Arduino sensors so

00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:06,250
the kind of vibrato and and the changes

00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:09,370
that affect light as he was going he had

00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:11,830
that control not through a MIDI foot

00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:13,720
controller or through noms here but

00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:15,610
modified on his guitar so he could use

00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,830
his hands like an extended whammy pedal

00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:20,400
that reaches through his computers that

00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:20,400
is cool

00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:34,800
here not quite because it's still the

00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:36,780
same sound from the guitar that's going

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,750
through it's just the effects that the

00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:42,270
software is putting on it he can you

00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:44,240
know change the vibrato or change the

00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:46,970
nature of the effect but it's not

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,440
changing the guitar to me it's just

00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:51,390
instead of its more similar to when I

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,310
was twiddling knobs while I was playing

00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:55,859
keyboard but he's able to do that in

00:42:53,310 --> 00:43:04,950
guitar by like like with his wrist

00:42:55,859 --> 00:43:13,380
basically also Arduino potential not

00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:15,690
gonna go through the whole video but she

00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:17,400
puts his iphone together with Arduino

00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:19,109
sensors and it's just a MIDI instrument

00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,300
right so it's just another controller

00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:24,690
that controllers decoupled from the

00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:26,700
sound processing so you can create your

00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:28,650
own custom midi controllers and then

00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:31,560
hook it in whatever kind of software

00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:35,970
right that how you play the instrument

00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:38,460
is different from how it sounds and this

00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:40,830
is something else super interesting to

00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:45,420
that effect this is a super bright airy

00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:48,660
thing from roland but it is a pickup on

00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:50,070
there it's going to roll in sound

00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:53,160
processing but you can actually use that

00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:56,180
pick up and get a MIDI output and it's

00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:59,369
getting each string on the guitar and

00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:03,150
translate that to MIDI notes so this guy

00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:05,960
can play guitar and get piano sampled

00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:05,960
sounds out just like a

00:44:06,789 --> 00:44:12,799
yeah yeah it could be anything it's

00:44:09,739 --> 00:44:14,449
Wyatt right so it totally decouples the

00:44:12,799 --> 00:44:18,799
controller for the sound processor again

00:44:14,449 --> 00:44:21,380
and then there's actually a relatively

00:44:18,799 --> 00:44:25,069
inexpensive one that isn't custom for a

00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:26,389
guitar and this just takes a quarter

00:44:25,069 --> 00:44:33,139
inch in point you can only do one note

00:44:26,389 --> 00:44:34,639
at a time you can't two chords well you

00:44:33,139 --> 00:44:38,179
could put any instrument in there and

00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:40,659
it's spinning video so this is guitar to

00:44:38,179 --> 00:44:43,729
me and coming out as a saxophone rights

00:44:40,659 --> 00:44:49,969
decoupled the controller from the sound

00:44:43,729 --> 00:44:55,329
processing death and one last video here

00:44:49,969 --> 00:44:55,329
and I have one of these on pre-order

00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:44,200
yeah so it's

00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:49,910
so it's like everything that I've been

00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:52,580
doing in my laptop but in an embedded

00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:54,860
computer that you can interact with like

00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:58,210
a foot pedal so really excited to see

00:46:54,860 --> 00:47:07,040
the potential for that I'm going to play

00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:08,030
one more song here so one of the other

00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:13,340
things are still need to figure out is

00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:14,660
how to you know save the settings for a

00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:16,640
song so that if I'm playing a bunch of

00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:18,350
songs i can just go ad and freeloader

00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,690
there's a few tools available to do that

00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:23,600
but I haven't found the one that fits

00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:25,370
the right workflow yet but it works well

00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:29,110
for this kind of talking demo because I

00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:33,770
want to and show you what's going on

00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:36,550
anyways so let's close a bunch of stuff

00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:36,550
that we don't need

00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:41,030
they use this

00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:56,650
I'm going to switch to a different sound

00:47:53,920 --> 00:48:03,250
processor called guitarist for my

00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:11,730
electric guitar and i'm using phablet as

00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:20,140
a drum sampler for the pads on my MIDI

00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:23,190
keyboard so let's get guitar x going

00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:23,190
into these loops

00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:31,650
think we have with me

00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:42,420
let's find out

00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:11,059
this is the tune called bad attraction

00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:14,479
by Brad sucks it's also free culture

00:49:11,059 --> 00:49:14,479
freely licensed

00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:49,710

00:52:57,690 --> 00:52:59,720
I

00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:12,510
but you know

00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:12,510
again

00:54:54,160 --> 00:55:04,700
this one hundred four hundred dollars

00:54:57,410 --> 00:55:10,790
before tax I know been named yet that

00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:12,829
it's a new trailer first but if you are

00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:15,049
interested in my music I have a mailing

00:55:12,829 --> 00:55:16,790
list signup here on rebooting my solo

00:55:15,049 --> 00:55:18,290
act next year with this kind of stuff so

00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:20,690
you can find out more there where these

00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:22,819
are resources if you're interested in

00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:24,410
learning more highly recommend nice oily

00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:26,799
fees on the screen while I tear it down

00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:26,799
