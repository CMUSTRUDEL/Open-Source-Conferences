	00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:31,760
good morning and welcome to F sauce it's

00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:46,070
exciting to see a room full of people

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:49,220
and many of you Oh drop the mic thank

00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:51,350
you many of you I count as friends

00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,450
either from a Seneca context or from an

00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:57,379
open source context it's it's great to

00:00:53,450 --> 00:01:01,010
see of that today I want to speak

00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:06,740
briefly about a very small word which is

00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:09,680
and so very very a short presentation

00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:13,340
about a short word but a think an

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,649
important concept for free software and

00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:19,610
open source now but first things first

00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:21,890
the important part a happy birthday to

00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:24,920
the Free Software Foundation it's been

00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:27,320
30 years since the FSF was formed 30

00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,690
years this month it's a little bit hard

00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,479
to determine when exactly you should

00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:34,610
celebrate birthday of free software

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,979
because you've got the start of the new

00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,709
project you've got the founding of the

00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:43,250
Free Software Foundation you've got the

00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:46,520
publishing of the canoe manifesto you've

00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:48,229
got the introduction of the GPL license

00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,240
a number of different dates to choose

00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:53,390
from but if you choose a middle date and

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,090
you use the founding of the organization

00:01:53,390 --> 00:02:00,800
as the starting point then we're at the

00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:05,950
30 year mark and that's that's quite a

00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:09,380
remarkable anniversary a major movement

00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:12,020
and we need to celebrate with cake so

00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:16,970
there will definitely be cake during

00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:18,349
this this symposium but that's that's

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,220
the important thing and this is the

00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:26,060
theme for this year's event and many of

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:29,000
the talks will touch on this but to

00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:32,660
really appreciate what those 30 years

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,840
mean we have to go back and and think

00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,430
about what computing was like three

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,700
decades ago

00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,469
the first documents that i got from the

00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,739
Free Software Foundation talked about

00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:48,609
the new project and talked about the

00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:53,090
availability of the software on these

00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:56,659
you could order tapes of the new project

00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:59,090
software and this was because there was

00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:02,540
no public internet public internet

00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:06,920
didn't appear for several years we had

00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,060
8-bit and 16-bit microcomputers of many

00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,139
different types many different

00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:14,840
architectures no USB flash drives to

00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:19,909
store this type of stuff on floppy disks

00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:22,250
of 360 k no standard networking even

00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:24,319
forget the internet it was difficult to

00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:27,319
connect even machines that were in the

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,780
same office and so things have changed a

00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:32,750
lot we've come a long way and a lot of

00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:35,540
the changes in our industry have been

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:40,280
driven by free software and by open

00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:42,620
source we use free software to run a lot

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,609
of the internet infrastructure we use it

00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,900
to run mail servers and social media we

00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:50,510
use hundreds of thousands of machines

00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,359
running Linux and other free software

00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:57,439
operating systems to back Google and

00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:59,299
Facebook and Flickr and Twitter and all

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:05,689
of these services that we use on a

00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:09,349
day-to-day basis so happy birthday to

00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:13,579
the Free Software Foundation and for

00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:14,930
those of you who consider 30 years to be

00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:20,349
an extremely long time because it

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:23,180
exceeds your lifetime consider that

00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:26,090
you're fortunate to have been born into

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:31,539
a world that has a high level of

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:31,539
connectivity a high level of computing

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,490
capability available to you on a daily

00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:41,419
basis in large part because of free and

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:46,060
open source software so let's start with

00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:51,700
a little bit of retrospective sharing

00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,700
free software is roughly 30 years old

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:58,110
but before free software we did have the

00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:00,570
sharing of software in fact if you go

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,759
back to the start of computing and you

00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,889
look at the very earliest machines which

00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:09,900
were usually one offs that were built by

00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:11,630
a school or by some organization for a

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,669
military project or something like that

00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:17,490
those one-off machines often had

00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:19,830
software published for them in academic

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:22,320
papers in research journals that type of

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:24,389
thing I recall reading a paper about a

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,240
computer at the University of Toronto

00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:29,130
that had been hand built from a bunch of

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,470
relays and I think some vacuum tubes as

00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:34,070
well and they were very excited that

00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,600
they had wired it up to a speaker and

00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:38,760
they wrote this entire paper about

00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,160
generating musical tones with a computer

00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,650
they published all the source code for

00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,630
doing that and they weren't particularly

00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,400
concerned about it being taken and used

00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:49,680
elsewhere because there was no other

00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,490
machine on the planet they could run

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:58,889
that code but from the beginning there

00:05:53,490 --> 00:06:00,599
was a sense of sharing as the industry

00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:03,090
developed and as we started to see

00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:07,199
machines that were produced in mass

00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:09,780
quantity software was really originally

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,150
viewed as something that went along with

00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,099
the hardware if you are buying a

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,800
computer to do you payroll stuff then

00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:19,349
they had to provide some software to you

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,820
to do the payroll stuff they had to

00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:23,550
provide an operating system and that

00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,440
just sort of went with the machine it

00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,060
didn't really occur to you companies in

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,880
the in the very early days that the

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:34,440
software was was something separate that

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:38,370
should be charged or separated from the

00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:42,240
hardware in those early days there were

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:44,699
often meetings of owners of these large

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,610
machines where they would swap tapes you

00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:49,650
take the nine track reel-to-reel tapes

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,449
get together they say oh I've got some

00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:54,900
improvements in this or I've got a piece

00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:57,060
of software for that and tapes were

00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,229
swapped between between the owners of

00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,770
these machines and the system

00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:04,460
administrators of these machines

00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:07,910
Lin Along Came microcomputers in the

00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:10,699
70's and into the 80s we had the early

00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:12,800
microcomputers no significant networking

00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:16,280
of them public internet was not

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,490
available we had a little bit of modem

00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:22,669
communication going on and the idea of a

00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:25,389
face to face swap continued lots of

00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:28,159
organizations lots of user groups had

00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:29,870
floppy swabs and tape swaps where people

00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:33,590
would get together they exchange

00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:35,599
software that they had written pass it

00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:39,409
back and forth on physical media and

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:42,289
this was just how computing was done it

00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:46,639
was was a natural part of the Sharon was

00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:50,599
a natural part of the formation of the

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:53,449
industry along with that we started to

00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:55,069
see the appearance of magazines hobbyist

00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:57,650
magazines and so forth there'd be source

00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:59,300
code listings in those magazines people

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,830
would type that in of course these

00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,629
magazines were copyright but the

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,699
software was regarded as something which

00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:07,250
you could type in to save on a cassette

00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:11,389
share with other users that you knew and

00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:14,330
again this the philosophy of sharing was

00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:16,520
pervasive throughout the industry and in

00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:19,330
fact in those early days there were some

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:22,669
companies that specialized in

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,740
distributing collections of software

00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:27,639
that others had written and placed into

00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:30,289
the public domain and so users would

00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:32,870
would write stuff they'd be excited

00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:34,909
about it they'd share it companies would

00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,579
as a convenience to other users collect

00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:39,440
these together I remember binders full

00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:42,770
of floppy disks that would be for sale

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,720
at computer fairs and so forth and for

00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,420
50 bucks or a hundred bucks you could

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:52,339
buy a collection of many many disks and

00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:57,050
thousands of programs and so even when

00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:58,970
the software was free by being placed in

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,950
the public domain there was a bit of

00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,470
commercial activity around that making

00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:06,470
it easy to to share and facilitating the

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:10,120
sharing of that software but we had I BM

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:12,589
in the 60s and 70s start to think about

00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,209
the value of the software that was

00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:14,630
running on the machines they started to

00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:17,720
say

00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:19,850
well maybe we should separate out

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,150
unbundle the software from the harbor

00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:25,850
may be a software is something that in

00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:29,000
and of itself has value and we should

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:32,600
monetize that and we should charge for

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,750
it and so you had a the beginning of the

00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:39,560
proprietary software push you saw this

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:42,020
in the microcomputer realm as well this

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,120
is a famous letter by none other than

00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:49,400
Bill Gates called an open letter to

00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:52,250
hobbyist dated 1976 and it's a a firmly

00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:56,000
worded letter probably arising out of

00:09:52,250 --> 00:10:01,610
some frustration where he chastises

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,680
hobbyists for sharing sharing pirating

00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:06,380
the software that his company had

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:10,370
produced and this rub some people the

00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:12,380
wrong way now it's in the current

00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:15,790
context it's a little difficult to look

00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:18,710
back at this and and understand but

00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:20,650
users coming from an environment where

00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:24,890
software was shared found it difficult

00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:27,260
to understand that there was primary

00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:30,320
software people wanted to keep control

00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,870
of and did not want publicly distributed

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,870
and there was a friction between these

00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,370
between these groups some interesting

00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,950
lines in here some rather strong lines

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:43,480
it says to the hobbyist Bill Gates

00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:46,700
writes most of you steal your software

00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:49,540
one of the first times it's the copying

00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:52,310
of software was referred to as theft and

00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,290
his frustration comes out in line such

00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:57,620
as who can afford to do professional

00:10:54,290 --> 00:11:04,340
work for nothing so we've got a clash of

00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:08,080
of context here so this is 1976 it's

00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:13,430
about eight years later just just under

00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:16,300
that Richard Stallman at MIT it gets

00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:18,710
frustrated with a new laser printer

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,480
Scott a laser printer there there's some

00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:23,960
bugs in the software that communicates

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,180
with the laser now a laser back in 83 84

00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:29,510
was a lot larger machine than it is

00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:33,020
it was a departmental device fairly

00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:34,760
expensive and he recognized that the

00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,339
bugs in the software weren't that

00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:41,570
difficult to fix that that they could

00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:42,740
fairly easily be be solved so he went

00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:45,620
looking for the source code he was going

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:48,050
to patch the software and and just

00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,270
update it and it was nowhere to be found

00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,980
he contacted the vendor and said what's

00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:54,550
going on could I kind of get source goes

00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:57,170
I going to fix some bugs in your code

00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,670
they said well no that's that's

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,320
proprietary that's part of our product

00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:03,470
you can't have access to that software

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,140
and it was at that point that he

00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:09,279
realized that the environment that he

00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:11,480
was used to the sharing environment the

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,459
concept that software was meant to be

00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,490
shared and explored as a community and

00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:18,830
and fixed and patched and improved was

00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:20,720
starting to disappear that the

00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:25,160
proprietary side was starting to take

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:28,730
over from that and the loss of that

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:33,320
previous freedom really got under his

00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:36,170
skin he really found that to be both

00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,850
annoying but also kind of scary he felt

00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,890
that he should be able to compute in the

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,480
way that he wanted to compute he should

00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:43,640
have access to source code he should be

00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:50,270
able to change the software to do what

00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:53,120
he wanted it to do so it's well known

00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:55,700
what he did he started a project called

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,550
the new project and the purpose of the

00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:01,160
new project was to implement an entire

00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:03,020
operating system if you look at his

00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,260
original announcement of the project

00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,459
back from 83 it was fairly ambitious he

00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,620
said we're going to write a new

00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:11,390
operating system we're going to start

00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:14,060
with a kernel and we're going to have

00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,140
some utilities and for some reason one

00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,560
of the things that you said they were

00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:21,170
going to have his the game empire why

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,120
that was important i'm not sure and he

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,770
said we're going to eventually add some

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,880
more stuff but we're going to start off

00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:31,310
with Lisp and c compilers and and we'll

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,110
just build it from there the project

00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:37,640
didn't quite unfold in the way that he

00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:38,850
envisioned they ended up rewriting most

00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,680
of the

00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:45,570
commands and utilities used in a UNIX

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,860
system but providing better versions

00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,300
much better than the proprietary

00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,880
versions that were provided by the

00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,700
operating system vendors so interesting

00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,200
thing you had almost all of the commands

00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,390
and utilities of a UNIX system

00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:02,230
implemented better than the proprietary

00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:07,270
vendors had implemented them but you had

00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:10,750
no current so most UNIX sites if you

00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:13,149
went to to a unix system administrator

00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:15,399
in the late 80s Early 90s you would find

00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:17,470
that they had at least some of the new

00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:21,790
project tools and utilities installed on

00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:24,760
their system but they were running a

00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:29,790
proprietary base operating system from

00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:32,380
one of the one of the system vendors so

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:34,600
significant contribution there many many

00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:37,270
different packages many replacements for

00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,060
and improvements upon the utilities

00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:42,040
present in the UNIX operating system but

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:46,330
I think that the biggest contribution of

00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:49,170
the Free Software Foundation was

00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:53,560
actually what they did with licensing

00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:56,980
prior to free software movement we

00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:59,860
released software from copyright by

00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,540
placing it in the public domain and that

00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,490
means that anybody could do anything

00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:05,050
with that software there was not really

00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:07,420
any restrictions once you play something

00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:09,279
the public domain anybody could do

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,440
anything with it some people view that

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,570
as a good thing if you put the software

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,459
in a public domain you didn't have any

00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:18,010
responsibilities as far as support of

00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:20,760
that software maintaining it so in some

00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:24,130
ways that absolves you of responsibility

00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:27,130
the Free Software Foundation and Richard

00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:32,610
Stallman and some of his band of merry

00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:36,310
men as it were decided to instead use

00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:42,160
copyright in a new way and copyright is

00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:44,740
the inherent right that the author of a

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,990
work has to control how that work is

00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:49,300
used and this is automatically given

00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:52,850
when you write something in certainly in

00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:55,350
most Western nations and now it's it's

00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:58,560
copyright regime is respected pretty

00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:02,100
much worldwide so he he thought you know

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,380
instead of just granting a blanket

00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,880
license by taking a piece of software

00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,270
that had been written and placing that

00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:13,200
fully into the public domain why not

00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:18,200
provide a license that would be perhaps

00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:23,520
free of cost and that would allow

00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:26,700
certain uses of that software but as a

00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:30,540
condition of those uses place certain

00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:33,330
obligations on the user and so there was

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:36,510
four freedoms that were defined as being

00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:38,990
important and i paraphrased here freedom

00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:42,210
zero the number from zero programmer

00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:44,550
humor here freedom zero the freedom to

00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:49,800
run the program as you wish for whatever

00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:51,990
purpose you see fit freedom won the

00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,970
freedom to study and change the code to

00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:58,220
make modifications to figure out how it

00:16:53,970 --> 00:17:01,620
works to learn from it to criticize it

00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:03,480
freedom to the freedom to redistributes

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,650
copies of the software so you can take

00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:10,709
that software I give it to your friends

00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:12,720
help your neighbor freedom three the

00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:14,520
freedom to distribute modified copies

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,070
not just verbatim copies of the software

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,570
as you received it but the freedom to

00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:21,959
distribute modified copies of that

00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:24,810
software including whatever improvements

00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:27,089
you had made to it now the the

00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:29,850
restriction that came with this was that

00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:34,770
if you distribute to the software you

00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:37,200
had to do so under the terms that you so

00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:40,530
you received it with these freedoms you

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:46,830
pass it on somebody in the back corner

00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:49,430
yes okay and I have no idea how to turn

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:51,960
off the front row but we run with that

00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:54,690
if you if you received it with these

00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,820
freedoms you had to pass it on with

00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:59,250
these freedoms as well and now there was

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,740
a leverage their you got the license as

00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:04,250
long as you passed on the freedoms and

00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:06,160
that was an interesting way of turning

00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:09,970
copyright on its head

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:12,330
referred to it as copyleft as a plan

00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:17,250
words but to express the concept of

00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:19,900
leveraging copyright to do something it

00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:30,160
perhaps wasn't originally intended to do

00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:35,380
a short while later a group of people

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:38,500
got together and decided that there was

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:41,890
a need for an alternate term there was a

00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,960
need for another way of referring to

00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:46,540
what on top to that point had been

00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,460
widely called pre software this is a

00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:53,320
term that was coined by Chris Patterson

00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:55,390
and it was first used at a meeting of

00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,190
the Open Source Initiative back in

00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,470
nineteen eighty nine so this is only a

00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:02,530
few years after the GPL was first

00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:05,670
published the organization that came out

00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:10,120
of that the Open Source Initiative is

00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:11,290
well-known now in Michael teman who was

00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,330
one of the people involved in the

00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:16,150
startup of this said that the purpose

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:18,270
was and this is direct quote to dump the

00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:21,070
moralizing and confrontational attitude

00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:24,430
that had been associated with the term

00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:27,760
free software and to promote open source

00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:32,350
ideas on pragmatic business case grounds

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:36,940
now if you call if you say that somebody

00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:39,730
is having a confrontational attitude and

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:42,130
is moralizing you're probably going to

00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:44,710
cause a little bit of friction there so

00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,330
there was a bit of friction right from

00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:49,720
the start between the two camps the

00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:52,480
open-source camp and the free software

00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,100
camp a bit of a bit of a collision

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,110
course even though in many cases they

00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,940
were talking about the same stuff a way

00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:02,350
that they were talking about it actually

00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:04,630
caused some significant friction but the

00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:09,250
Open Source Initiative brought a focus

00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:11,500
on some some new aspects of free

00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:14,710
software open source software there is a

00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:18,880
focus on business a focus on using the

00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:19,929
software in a business context the Four

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,850
Freedoms

00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:25,119
that are proposed by the Free Software

00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:27,149
Foundation are really directed at an

00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,559
individual there are personal freedoms

00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:31,960
the Open Source Initiative wanted to

00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:36,039
focus on business use and business case

00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:38,649
for the software the Open Source

00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:42,009
Initiative also had a greater emphasis

00:20:38,649 --> 00:20:45,039
on collaboration and on community and on

00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:48,789
methodologies so the open source

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:51,090
emphasis is on making great software

00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:54,999
through collaborative engineering

00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:58,330
concepts like many eyeballs making bugs

00:20:54,999 --> 00:21:03,999
shallow come more from the open source

00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:07,779
camp the concept that many many

00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:10,619
contributors and many people building on

00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:15,100
and expanding and developing a codebase

00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:17,649
can do a better job with that than a

00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,629
small team behind closed doors the

00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:21,850
concept that everybody in the room is

00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:24,039
smarter than any one person in the room

00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:28,330
these are things that the open source

00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:34,539
initiative pushed and promoted in their

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:37,210
in their focus so three errors the era

00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:39,340
of software sharing where there wasn't

00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:41,470
really any sort of legal framework for

00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:44,769
it stuff was just put in the public

00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:48,340
domain or worse yet just shared without

00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:51,779
really having any thought about

00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:54,399
copyright the free software movement

00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:56,860
which developed a legal framework around

00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:59,679
that the licensing and so forth that

00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:03,730
would be necessary to protect freedoms

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:06,669
and to you to give it a name to give us

00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:08,710
some focus to draw attention to the

00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:11,409
concept of freedom in the use and

00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:13,869
development of software and then the

00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:17,289
Open Source Initiative which built on

00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:19,600
those concepts moved away from some of

00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:22,450
the perhaps high rhetoric that was

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,210
associated with free software added an

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,369
emphasis on business use on

00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:29,559
collaboration on software development

00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:32,340
methodologies and on the production of

00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:32,340
quality software

00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:38,320
bit of a collision course here that's

00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:41,680
the background let's go back to the word

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:45,010
and this is a word that I really want to

00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:49,270
focus on here in the context of free

00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:51,310
software and open source we have often

00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:53,470
talked about the free software camp is

00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:54,880
looking at things this way the

00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:59,380
open-source camp is looking at things

00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:03,490
this way I would really like to to focus

00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:06,130
our attention on fact that free software

00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:08,260
and open source are not necessarily

00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:11,530
different things that there are two ways

00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:16,240
of looking at the same thing in in many

00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:18,670
situations consider this the vast

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:22,380
majority of projects that identify

00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:24,700
themselves as being open source projects

00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,850
use licenses that the Free Software

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:31,480
Foundation would consider a free

00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:34,930
software license so effectively that

00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,820
means that software that is viewed by

00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:40,000
the people that write that software is

00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,890
being open source could be viewed by

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,710
another party as being free software

00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:47,200
it's not free software over there open

00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:48,910
source over there it's one thing being

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,270
looked at from the left and from the

00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:56,740
right two different views of exactly the

00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:58,810
same software notice that I spent a lot

00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:03,850
of time and money researching this

00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:05,740
quantity vast majority nope that just

00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:09,010
might off the top of my head estimate

00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:12,640
but I think if you look at the licenses

00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:14,470
in a large software distribution you

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,720
will find that the vast majority of the

00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:18,850
licenses that are classified as

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:26,140
open-source are also classified as free

00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:29,470
by the FSF here's an interesting

00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:32,230
counterpoint though this is a quote from

00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:35,700
richard stallman and it's about this

00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:38,710
year's f sauce 2015 infographic and

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,880
commenting on it he said your

00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,380
infographic you may have seen this

00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,970
infographic and some of the emails that

00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,710
we sent out or some of the banner

00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,530
posters that we've got we've used

00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,850
portions of

00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:49,760
on our website and the number of

00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:53,810
different materials he said your

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:58,600
infographic says open source a term

00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:58,600
which stands for rejection of my views

00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:04,250
so at the same time that one piece of

00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:07,850
software can be viewed as being free

00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:13,910
software and open source boat there's

00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:15,980
still strong strong feelings about one

00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:21,580
view by the people that hold the other

00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:26,140
view so there's there's a real a real

00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:28,670
edge a real conflict that's present here

00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:32,840
what I want to dig into that a little

00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:35,990
bit I want to look at something that

00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:38,510
grates people some people in our

00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:42,680
communities and that's the question of

00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:45,350
permissive versus copyleft licenses so

00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:48,160
permissive license as we all know

00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:50,960
permissive license enables you to make a

00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:55,610
non-free derivative of a piece of

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:57,680
software let me say that again a

00:25:55,610 --> 00:26:00,290
permissive license let you make lets you

00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,620
make a non-free derivative of a piece of

00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:06,530
software if you are going to take an

00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:10,460
open-source projects code incorporate it

00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:13,130
into a television you may do so and not

00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:16,520
pass on the code to anybody who buys

00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:18,890
that television you can take that code

00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,960
and run with it and we've seen some

00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:22,670
examples of this we're open source

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,190
software has been incorporated into

00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:28,340
proprietary projects a very early

00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:30,650
example of this perhaps was the tcp/ip

00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:33,770
stack that was incorporated into windows

00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:36,620
it has had its origins in the bsd

00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:40,820
project and the bsd permissive license

00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:43,570
allowed microsoft to take that tcp/ip

00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:47,960
stack incorporated into windows as a

00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:49,670
proprietary software offering and not

00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,530
pass back the improvements that they

00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:53,510
made to that code to the original

00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:56,050
project or to the people that bought

00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,050
their software

00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:06,830
copyleft licenses on the other hand have

00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:09,740
a requirement that derivatives remain

00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:12,470
free so once free always free

00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:15,800
effectively with copyleft if you had

00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:17,600
taken a piece of software that was under

00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:22,120
one of the copyleft licenses such as a

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:24,470
GPL and you incorporated that into an

00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,920
otherwise proprietary piece of software

00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:31,010
you would basically be required to

00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:32,990
distribute that software as free

00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,880
software right if you're going to use

00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:37,220
code if you're going to take advantage

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,440
of code that's been written under a free

00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,720
software license under copyleft license

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,420
then the code that you incorporate that

00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,160
into must also be licensed in the same

00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:49,400
way or you're not allowed to use the

00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:52,670
code now if you want to look at this

00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:55,550
negatively permissive licenses are sort

00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:57,320
of smash-and-grab right in this way that

00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:59,960
you have a jewelry thief that will just

00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:02,000
smash a window grab the stuff and run

00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,910
with it and they're out of there some

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,340
say that permissive licenses allow

00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:11,120
companies to do that they allow them to

00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:13,010
take the labor that has gone into an

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,080
open source project to grab that

00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:18,380
software suck it into a proprietary

00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:21,830
product and not contribute back at all

00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:24,620
to the community into the to the project

00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:28,310
on the other hand if you want to look

00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:31,070
very negatively at copyleft licenses you

00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:33,650
would say that they're a ball and anchor

00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:36,050
that their viral that if you use any of

00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:38,720
that code it infects the rest of your

00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:41,690
code with a requirement that it be

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,870
released under the same copy left free

00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:46,940
software licenses so it is possible to

00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:50,170
look at either of these approaches

00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:56,630
either of these regimes in a very

00:28:50,170 --> 00:29:01,360
negative way let's consider are there

00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:06,230
any incentives to release a source code

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:08,450
outside of the license if you are if you

00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:10,130
have a permissive license and you're

00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,270
allowed to take source code and suck it

00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:14,450
into

00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:16,490
a proprietary product and not release

00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:19,070
the code either to you the people you

00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:22,100
distribute your software to or to the

00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:27,170
upstream originator zuv that code are

00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:28,970
there any pressures on you to release

00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:31,430
that code anyways outside of the license

00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:35,180
what are what are things that would

00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:37,250
encourage you or make it you can present

00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:39,500
a business case for releasing that

00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:43,180
source and I would suggest that there

00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:47,450
are 11 simple example of this is the

00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:49,130
incredibly high cost of failing to

00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:52,910
upstream your code and this even applies

00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:57,740
in a copyleft context but consider for a

00:29:52,910 --> 00:30:00,860
minute you've taken code from an

00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:03,380
upstream project you've taken that code

00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:05,540
and you've modified it you've extended

00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:09,740
its functionality you've added that five

00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:11,570
or ten percent additional functionality

00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:16,670
additional features that you need in

00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:20,450
order to use it in your context or in

00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:22,850
your product but you don't contribute

00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:24,770
those source code changes back upstream

00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:29,180
you don't contribute them to the

00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:34,640
originating project how is that

00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:39,140
expensive I would propose that it's

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:41,270
expensive because every time that

00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:44,270
upstream project releases a new version

00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:47,210
of the software you basically have to

00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:49,700
redo the changes that you've made to

00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:52,490
that software now you've got two options

00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:55,580
there you could never update your

00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:58,310
software you could basically take the

00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:02,720
software from a project apply a bunch of

00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:04,430
changes and never contribute those

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,530
changes back upstream but never update

00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:09,410
the product either but you never update

00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:14,120
the code that you've modified this is a

00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:18,590
bad choice security issues additional

00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:21,140
features bug fixes that are made in that

00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:22,730
upstream project are not reflected in

00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:25,610
your product they're not reflected in

00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:27,690
the software that you've modified

00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:30,030
this is bad you've got bit rot

00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:32,370
effectively your device or your product

00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:35,760
or whatever it is that you that you've

00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:37,620
incorporated that software into doesn't

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,059
receive the benefits of the

00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:43,260
contributions that are going into the

00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:46,230
upstream project the alternative is to

00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:47,970
repeatedly every time the upstream

00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:52,080
releases a new version of the software

00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:54,660
take your changes and reapply them to

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,059
that new version of the software so

00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:59,760
they've got release one you've modified

00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:03,620
it to do something you've distributed

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:06,960
that that change version the upstream

00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:09,570
community releases release two it's got

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,700
some security fixes it's fifteen percent

00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:14,970
faster and it's got a couple of new

00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:17,580
features if you're going to take

00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:19,620
advantage of the improvement in that

00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:21,630
code you've got to reapply the changes

00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:23,640
that you originally made to that new

00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:26,700
version and you're going to be doing

00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:29,190
that forever every time a new version of

00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,840
that software is released if you want to

00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:33,450
take advantage of the improvements then

00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:37,980
you've got to reapply the changes that

00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:39,750
you've made on the other hand if you

00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,240
take the changes that you've made and

00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:45,720
you contribute them to that upstream

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,450
project and they get incorporated which

00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,919
is no small feat you've got to convince

00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:52,860
that upstream community that your

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,630
changes are valid they've got to meet

00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:56,970
the technical and engineering

00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:59,929
requirements of that community you've

00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:04,760
got to take the time to convince them

00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:07,610
and and do some social work with them to

00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:09,720
sort of squeeze your way in and and

00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:13,200
convince them that they should take your

00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:15,510
changes but if you do that then from

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,630
then on every release from that upstream

00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:19,919
community incorporates the changes that

00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:23,700
you've made the improvements and

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:26,270
modifications that you've made this is

00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:30,030
this is no small thing if it takes you a

00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:32,730
programmer full time to just keep up

00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:33,929
with upstream software releases then

00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:35,070
you're talking about a hundred thousand

00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:37,830
dollars a year you're talking about a

00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:38,580
million dollars a decade just to keep up

00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:41,990
with

00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:44,779
patches to the upstream software

00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:49,140
contributing to that upstream community

00:33:44,779 --> 00:33:50,870
can save you real money so what I'm

00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:55,440
trying to say here is that there are are

00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:59,070
other reasons for contributing code that

00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:08,129
are not necessarily forced by a software

00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:11,339
license can we take the best of both

00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:14,760
worlds if we've got free software and

00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:17,700
open source labels both applying to one

00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:20,040
piece of software can we take the most

00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:23,700
valuable attributes of both of those

00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,109
perspectives and combine them I think in

00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:27,330
order to do that we need to consider

00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:29,839
what is the best of both worlds what is

00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:33,300
the important part of the free software

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:34,619
perspective on a project what is the

00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:39,510
important part of the open-source

00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:41,099
software perspective of that project so

00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:44,659
I think from the free software angle

00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:47,760
there's a very high emphasis on freedom

00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:50,399
now we write that as a single word right

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,020
freedom but you see the expression from

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,389
the Free Software Foundation of that

00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:56,399
being at least four separate freedoms

00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:58,050
and then they break it down into

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,390
additional detail of this freedom so

00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:04,640
there's there's a number of things that

00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:07,920
are packed into that one word freedom

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:11,040
the piece that goes with that the

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,930
challenge that goes with that is that of

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:17,160
obligation right the obligation to

00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:21,270
contribute back when you're under a

00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:28,830
copyleft license from the open-source

00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:32,640
angle I think the pieces that are most

00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:34,470
valuable and the the angles that that

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,640
come out when viewed through an

00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:41,790
open-source lens our collaboration the

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,690
focus on community the focus on a group

00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:48,330
of people working together in concert to

00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:50,940
improve that piece of software I think

00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:52,170
it's a focus on quality a focus on

00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:57,180
engineering

00:35:52,170 --> 00:36:00,599
principles and the importance of a

00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:02,099
precision man a job well done and I

00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:04,890
think from the open source angle we've

00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:07,290
got a significantly stronger emphasis on

00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:14,220
business than we do from the free

00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:16,589
software angle down side some uses of

00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:20,579
open source some some perspectives on

00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:22,650
that from a free software a perspective

00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,660
involve restriction because they don't

00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:27,390
necessarily provide you with the

00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:31,020
freedoms that the free software people

00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:35,059
of value so highly so let's combine

00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:39,480
these let's return to the concept of and

00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:42,299
let's take and consider both of these

00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:45,630
pieces together when we're looking at

00:36:42,299 --> 00:36:48,420
free software when we're looking at open

00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:52,770
source because in the vast majority of

00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:55,349
cases both of these principles apply to

00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:57,440
the software that we use and we apply

00:36:55,349 --> 00:37:04,490
one or both of these labels to

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:11,520
personally I want I need I benefit from

00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:15,119
both sides I personally expect the

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,160
benefits that we get from both sides of

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:22,589
the screen here in the software that I

00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:25,170
use so I thrive on the community the

00:37:22,589 --> 00:37:26,940
community that goes into the development

00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:28,650
of open source software and the support

00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:32,450
of open source software and the

00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:37,619
deployment of open source software is

00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:41,640
exciting valuable and a source of energy

00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:43,859
to me I appreciate the quality that goes

00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:47,430
into open source software the fact that

00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:49,200
so many people have looked at it have

00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:53,190
contributed bug reports have contributed

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:57,319
documentation in many cases provides a

00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:57,319
really good piece of software

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:05,420
I am and I'm completely honest here I

00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:10,099
have lived off the business of open

00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:13,819
source for the last just shy of two

00:38:10,099 --> 00:38:17,029
decades in one way or another open

00:38:13,819 --> 00:38:23,329
source free software has put food on my

00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:25,309
table so I appreciate that angle to the

00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:30,019
software projects that i use but at the

00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:34,509
same time I demand the freedom that the

00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:37,609
free software lens is focused on I

00:38:34,509 --> 00:38:41,000
expect to be able to inspect software

00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:43,369
for the devices that I use I expect to

00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,460
be able to control my own computing

00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:49,369
environment in the way that I want I

00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:53,150
don't read the source code to all of the

00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:54,980
software that I use but when something

00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:57,670
happens when I have a question I want to

00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:00,410
be able to do that that's that's a basic

00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:05,450
expectation that I now have of the

00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:09,619
software that I use so my software is

00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:13,190
not free software or open source my

00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:17,029
software is free software and open

00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:19,940
source it's both I rely on the benefits

00:39:17,029 --> 00:39:23,390
from both perspectives and I would

00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:26,240
encourage you to to look at software in

00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:29,420
that way so look at these projects and

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,740
say don't don't put yourself in one camp

00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,420
for the other don't put yourself in a

00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:35,529
free software camp don't put yourself in

00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:38,930
the open source camp use both lenses

00:39:35,529 --> 00:39:42,440
take full advantage of both perspectives

00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:47,660
and the value that each of those brings

00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:49,250
to the projects that we work with so my

00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,690
simple request as you listen to the

00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:54,680
presentations throughout today and

00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:58,869
tomorrow value the and in free software

00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,869
and open source thank you

00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:12,670
we have some time for discussion is

00:40:10,089 --> 00:40:16,960
there any questions that you would like

00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:23,560
to raise or discuss related to this

00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:26,320
topics it's kind of a 50-point but one

00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:28,900
reason why software was open in the good

00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:33,130
old days the u.s. is believed that

00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:36,190
copyright applied to software that would

00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:40,410
change sometime in the 1970s I just

00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:40,410
don't remember exactly when and

00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:48,190
connecting it to today it looks like the

00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:51,660
trans-pacific partnership is going to

00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:55,300
make copyright even more onerous or

00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:57,880
going to extend it 20 more years I think

00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:01,780
something like that and it's going to

00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:05,140
have more tea so it does seem as if

00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:09,190
they're always forces that are

00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:10,380
polarizing I started out definitely on

00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:13,990
the

00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:18,970
putting my software in public for me but

00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:22,470
I have become very much a GPL person now

00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:26,590
seeing how open domain software has been

00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:31,840
abused and exploited and an example that

00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:34,300
you gave the tcp/ip stack our first off

00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:36,849
I think it more egregious example the

00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:39,490
Kerberos where they took their spat

00:41:36,849 --> 00:41:41,560
standard and changed it without

00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:46,119
explaining to anybody else they're

00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:50,680
interactive so I've become more militant

00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:54,010
as time goes on towards the free

00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:57,760
software side of things but I absolutely

00:41:54,010 --> 00:42:04,030
agree with your point terrific talk it's

00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:06,609
not the certainly the copyright regime

00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:11,230
has changed over these last number of

00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:14,349
decades patent regime also is a barrier

00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:17,710
to some of the work that we do there are

00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:20,980
many software patents which are trivial

00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:23,700
and stand in the way of free software

00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:32,250
and open source implementations of

00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:32,250
protocols algorithms of compatibility

00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:38,710
mechanisms file readers those sorts of

00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:42,849
things and so there's there's definitely

00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:45,940
a evolving legal landscape that is a bit

00:42:42,849 --> 00:42:50,910
of a minefield that will my appeal for

00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:50,910
us like

00:42:51,990 --> 00:43:02,700
but we go with the emerging things which

00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:11,109
do you see that there is you see

00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:15,010
difficulties or any conflicts around the

00:43:11,109 --> 00:43:17,280
idea of complying like on one hand

00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:20,830
providing a very high degree of all

00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,930
really high degree of reliability and on

00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:26,530
the other hand allowing that really

00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:28,359
excessive ility in modify ability we've

00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:30,369
already seen we've already seen a lot of

00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:37,270
Google interpret the law so effectively

00:43:30,369 --> 00:43:39,609
does not matter but do you see that

00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:41,170
there are any challenges there and do

00:43:39,609 --> 00:43:45,070
you have you proposed remedies for how

00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:48,430
we can keep the place apparently under

00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:53,890
standard rooms while also accidentally

00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:56,380
set our house on fire excellent question

00:43:53,890 --> 00:44:00,430
internet of things does anybody have a

00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:02,950
single global for internet of things

00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:07,119
right now we're in a bit of a wild wild

00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:09,910
west with respect to IOT right and in

00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,400
fact if anybody comes up with yet

00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:14,859
another Wi-Fi or Bluetooth enabled color

00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:19,510
changing light bulb i think i'm just

00:44:14,859 --> 00:44:21,940
going to stab myself and i but right now

00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:24,190
we're at the start of things there are

00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:27,339
so many different protocols so many

00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:34,200
different approaches that's that it's

00:44:27,339 --> 00:44:38,619
crazy but yes do you want do you want a

00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:41,369
tcp/ip connected light bulb to have a

00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:41,369
microphone in it

00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:56,910
what could that do if you need so I

00:44:51,660 --> 00:45:01,440
think that the the value of access to

00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:05,430
source code for modification but even as

00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:09,720
a bare minimum for auditability in IOT

00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:11,630
is going to be pretty critical I thought

00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:15,000
it was interesting you mention IRT

00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:21,320
possibly being defined as any device

00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:29,090
with a tcp/ip stack interesting piece

00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:32,250
how much do you pay for a tcp/ip stack 0

00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:34,380
20 years ago TCP well over 20 years ago

00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:36,780
tcp/ip stack cost four hundred dollars a

00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:39,360
seat it was it was something that you

00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:42,750
paid for writing for every every desktop

00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:48,450
machine you paid that kind of money for

00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:50,220
the tcp/ip stack by itself four hundred

00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:55,830
dollars per internet-connected light

00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:57,480
bulb or per one of 50 or 100 or 500 IOT

00:45:55,830 --> 00:46:02,040
devices that you'll end up with in your

00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:06,090
home is nuts right so the only real way

00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:09,420
to make IOT work is a different

00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:12,960
licensing regime than then you know some

00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:15,930
very high charges per device and really

00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:19,680
in many cases that's only enabled by

00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:22,020
free software and open source but then

00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,030
building on top of that what what

00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:26,130
happens whether is what are those pieces

00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:29,010
what a security vulnerability is going

00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:30,330
to be in your house when you've got a

00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:33,330
couple hundred devices that are all

00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:35,100
talking to each other or split into six

00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:36,540
different groups that talk to each other

00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,950
within the group and don't talk to the

00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:40,670
other groups which is more likely what's

00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:43,650
going to happen in the short run and

00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:45,690
yeah what sort of privacy concerns does

00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:47,490
that raise what's the role of free

00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:52,220
software and and open source and

00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:56,599
dressing that I feel that that that's

00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:58,250
play the key role anyone's comments on

00:46:56,599 --> 00:47:09,940
that free software and open source in

00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:15,410
the IOT space there's definitely an

00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:18,650
educational we're going to if you look

00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:21,650
at the onboard a lot more consciousness

00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:24,980
and on security the criminal element

00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:29,420
strong society have being us internet

00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:33,020
things the exempt i love the tribe who

00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:36,740
this is they're taking cheap myths based

00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:41,780
routers sticking them in the bottoms of

00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:45,260
comedy pots and kettles programming

00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:47,810
connected any of my body and forming 5

00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:50,930
knots presenting today these are shipped

00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:54,410
out through alleys brass ele screen and

00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:58,730
end up in kitchens i would raise

00:47:54,410 --> 00:48:03,200
awareness how do we teach that this is

00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:07,330
happening and how many think people to

00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,330
treat it as a public health issue

00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:11,730
although that may be strain a little bit

00:48:10,049 --> 00:48:14,759
from what we can do with free software

00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:18,140
and open source or licensing and in

00:48:14,759 --> 00:48:24,089
terms but yes valid valid concerns

00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:26,640
initiative library was it in internet of

00:48:24,089 --> 00:48:28,380
things that could have the difference

00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,920
between there's no distinction to be

00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,590
made

00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,850
we have you never compromised and

00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:37,230
effectively having your house being

00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:39,030
closed and there may actually be no

00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:40,500
distinction between having your home

00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:44,190
that we're compromised and having your

00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:47,370
IOT devices tour not that's probably the

00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:54,860
case that's that's coming at us in the

00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:58,440
back there's only to trade out the

00:48:54,860 --> 00:49:01,440
security and conveniences that for the

00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:03,570
source garage especially the place that

00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:08,400
are becoming infected our home I think

00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:12,960
if we watch it sometimes be happy

00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:16,260
security one of the things exactly of

00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:18,420
our example the privacy settings freak

00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:19,860
people out of their updates people out

00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:23,670
of the terms of security under other

00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:28,730
devices but it's sort of like what

00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:28,730
you're paying for that convenience is

00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:45,300
security price so you're saying

00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:48,420
effectively that that there's a

00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:50,250
trade-off here between what's the open

00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,900
source angle to to this trade-off that

00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:55,440
you're talking about between security

00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:59,360
convenience and funding of the stores

00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,360
anyone has access the

00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,530
why

00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:14,480
s more control over devices that work

00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:14,480
easysoft so

00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,180
r

00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:38,080
hacker a more in-depth perspective upon

00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:44,770
these devices and how so okay so raising

00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:50,730
a valid question there does open source

00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:54,100
in devices increase or decrease your

00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:55,690
security exposure I think you could make

00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:58,180
a case either way and the cases have

00:50:55,690 --> 00:51:00,460
been made by the way the fact that the

00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:02,800
code is available means that people are

00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:06,430
examining it people wearing black hats

00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:09,730
are examining it but potentially it also

00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:12,580
means that a defect which a manufacturer

00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:16,510
could just sort of gloss over can't has

00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:20,280
readily be be glossed over Mike raised

00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:24,390
an interesting point earlier about risk

00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:27,280
if we want to allow people to change

00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:29,880
software on the devices they own and

00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:32,650
free software angle would encourage that

00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:36,940
how do we ensure that they do so in a

00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:39,430
safe way so for example a device that

00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:42,310
has a software-defined radio and is

00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:45,940
serving Wi-Fi signals to your house if

00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:48,760
you miss adjusts that software defined

00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:53,050
radio you can interfere with radar

00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:55,840
systems so how do you allow someone to

00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:59,890
change that software to improve it to

00:51:55,840 --> 00:52:03,370
fix bugs and yet not allow that negative

00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:06,280
side effect this is even more of an

00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:10,240
issue when you start looking at cars if

00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:12,910
you want to allow somebody to to create

00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:16,720
an application for the in-car

00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:18,580
entertainment system or the in-car

00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,620
information system and you want that

00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:22,780
information system to be interface to

00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:24,670
the engine because you want to get

00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:26,349
performance beta and other

00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:30,000
from the engine how much gas is left

00:52:26,349 --> 00:52:33,609
before you run out of fuel and so forth

00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,670
how do you allow them to modify that

00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:39,730
software to to create applications to to

00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:44,049
deal with and have control over that

00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:46,510
aspect of the software and yet not turn

00:52:44,049 --> 00:52:49,420
off all of lushan control to increase

00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:52,510
their good mileage how do you not

00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:55,540
interfere with safety systems on the

00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:59,619
vehicle how to not interfere with basic

00:52:55,540 --> 00:53:03,460
controls like brakes how do you do that

00:52:59,619 --> 00:53:06,240
how do we provide freedom how do we not

00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:09,099
walk down the device that people can

00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:14,609
make improvements to the software and

00:53:09,099 --> 00:53:18,099
yet respect that those devices have some

00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:21,339
public impact that changes that we make

00:53:18,099 --> 00:53:23,980
to these devices can affect our society

00:53:21,339 --> 00:53:27,099
they can increase risk on the roads they

00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:29,500
can reduce the effectiveness of fairly

00:53:27,099 --> 00:53:32,260
critical radar systems or health systems

00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:34,809
and so forth this is going to be an

00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:38,040
increasing challenge there's some

00:53:34,809 --> 00:53:41,170
interesting ideas that had been proposed

00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:42,520
certification programs somebody has said

00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:45,040
that in the states where they're trying

00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:47,819
to prevent users from making changes to

00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:51,250
the software on their own Wi-Fi routers

00:53:47,819 --> 00:53:52,690
that an exception be made so that you

00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:54,730
could get a software approved by

00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:57,430
somebody who's licensed to understand

00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:59,650
the radio circuitry and impacts of the

00:53:57,430 --> 00:54:02,589
software changes on the radio signals

00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:04,210
they can sign off on it and it could be

00:54:02,589 --> 00:54:08,200
digitally signed and then installable on

00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:10,150
your machine other approaches with

00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:13,510
vehicles we have to start looking at

00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:15,430
things like can we fully isolate the two

00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:19,180
systems can we use a virtualization

00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:20,770
system to separate that same thing with

00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:22,630
the phone if you're going to run

00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:24,670
business apps on your phone actually

00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:27,670
this is a pet peeve of mine in order to

00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:32,109
connect to my enterprise email system

00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:34,420
with my phone's email client I had to

00:54:32,109 --> 00:54:34,840
agree that my employer could wipe my

00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:40,360
phone

00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:42,640
remotely wow I did not have a lot of

00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:46,810
confidence to hit the button yes I

00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:50,170
accept that that was that was a real

00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:52,480
issue for me but I can understand that

00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:55,240
my employer we want to be able to

00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:58,720
protect their information if that phone

00:54:55,240 --> 00:55:00,370
gets stolen or compromised and yet I

00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,650
want to protect my own personal

00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:06,760
information from my employer meddling

00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:08,740
with it we have some real some really

00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:12,970
interesting issues that go beyond just

00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:19,750
access to the source code to address in

00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:21,130
the in the coming days we have a few

00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:31,270
more minutes there was a couple of

00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:33,910
questions they had different settings

00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:37,060
for how aggressive they could make the

00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:46,330
driver so how are they going to go back

00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:49,620
and offer a more like when do you want

00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:49,620
to be able to modify your cart software

00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:59,500
well yeah yes I think we're headed

00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:04,390
towards some interesting questions there

00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:07,270
yeah yeah a self-driving car or soft

00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:10,870
driving cars proved to be substantially

00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:12,550
safer than human driven cars is it

00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:14,820
possible that we'll have roadways where

00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:17,900
human driven cars are not permitted

00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:24,980
that's interesting

00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:27,710
it could be so hey 11 questions often

00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:30,260
were raised when a collision is

00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:33,799
inevitable because of an unforeseen

00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:38,089
circumstance a bridge collapse or

00:56:33,799 --> 00:56:43,400
landslides something and somebody is

00:56:38,089 --> 00:56:45,289
going to die should it be we've got some

00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:48,920
interesting interesting challenges there

00:56:45,289 --> 00:56:51,020
and if as a society we decide that the

00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:53,150
person that should die the person that

00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:54,710
the software should kill if it's

00:56:53,150 --> 00:57:01,609
unavoidable that somebody is going to

00:56:54,710 --> 00:57:03,940
die the collision should be in some

00:57:01,609 --> 00:57:06,200
cases the occupant of the vehicle

00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:08,539
because there's only one occupant there

00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:11,020
and if you hit those pedestrians over

00:57:08,539 --> 00:57:15,049
there you're likely to kill four people

00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:17,690
what does that do in terms of freedom to

00:57:15,049 --> 00:57:19,819
modify your software do you allow people

00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:22,010
to modify the software and override

00:57:19,819 --> 00:57:25,400
those decisions in favor of their own

00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:28,640
life when as a society maybe that's not

00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:31,789
the decision that's in the best interest

00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:35,569
of the society there's going to be some

00:57:31,789 --> 00:57:39,819
really interesting intersections of

00:57:35,569 --> 00:57:39,819
these challenges yes

00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:48,420
very important because in the auto

00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:54,550
industry in that case event

00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:57,700
and the outcome say aww and but we can't

00:57:54,550 --> 00:58:01,390
trust them on this because that they're

00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:04,290
not attacking agriculture and we don't

00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:04,290
know what happened with

00:58:16,839 --> 00:58:22,270
we have a stressful working Defense Act

00:58:22,299 --> 00:58:29,329
audibility after a tragedy is useful for

00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:31,339
assigning liability but audibility of

00:58:29,329 --> 00:58:34,220
software before a tragedy could have

00:58:31,339 --> 00:58:37,910
even more value if we can detect

00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:42,460
potential problems the regime's for that

00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:45,200
would be the interesting to develop and

00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:47,210
that's the point I want to pick up on

00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:49,819
here what can we learn from the history

00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:52,730
of free software open doors that's

00:58:49,819 --> 00:58:54,470
transferable to the emerging problems

00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:59,420
and opportunities that will emerge with

00:58:54,470 --> 00:59:01,640
robotics cards Internet of Things we're

00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:03,000
going to be in an era of great

00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:05,550
technological change

00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:10,350
daenerys all of which will have a basis

00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:13,710
of soft ground ability and so my

00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:16,680
question is we've got one incidence that

00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:19,800
we merge the original history how can we

00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:23,790
transfer that in a predictive predictive

00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:27,300
way to offset of preventing problems

00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:30,960
that will have to go to have an example

00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:32,610
in mind of how to repeat the question or

00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,620
the to repeat the point that's being

00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:36,600
made we should learn from our history

00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:39,270
with free and open source software and

00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:40,710
apply that system of the optimal

00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:42,890
scenarios do you have an example

00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:45,510
alignment example one principle

00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:48,210
transparency in the sense that whatever

00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:50,220
is done you open it much as possible the

00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:52,080
other one is a legal principle if you've

00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:55,950
done something you have a culpability

00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:58,050
normative galvin screen you know you

00:59:55,950 --> 01:00:00,480
have a benefit but you also have some

00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:03,210
responses so when you look at for

01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:06,350
example well Volkswagens paying this

01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:11,460
price right now they misread that that

01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:13,860
you like benefit-cost kind of

01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:15,330
opportunity and they will pay a price as

01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:18,190
a result that's a learning moment for

01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:22,870
that and presumably that lesson

01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:24,610
other car manufacturers in advanced so

01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:27,190
that's kind of Prince about looking for

01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:29,400
openness transparency and as I say

01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:37,960
people and other ownership

01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:40,240
responsibility that's two there are yes

01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:43,360
I just wanted to kind of throw something

01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:45,520
out I mean the term hacker was used and

01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:47,290
i'll declare i'm i'm class of 81

01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:49,720
university of waterloo so i'm a bit

01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:51,910
dated got lots of history but in the old

01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:54,040
days you know they were called Quality

01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:56,650
Assurance folks and as we know in

01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:58,840
proprietary software has bugs and

01:00:56,650 --> 01:01:00,730
manufacturers didn't fix them in a

01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:02,770
timely fashion but if you look at

01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:04,300
packing and I'm thinking about jobs now

01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:07,800
I'm thinking about educational

01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:12,160
institutions how can you can you can you

01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:15,430
slot hackers as the good positive

01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:17,770
quality assurance style hacker versus

01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:19,960
terrorists can you can you divide that

01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:22,690
up and can you can you separate it based

01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:25,030
on your argument of free software open

01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:27,700
source open sources interesting words

01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:30,540
collaboration quality business the

01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:34,390
positive hacker that I know that to be a

01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:36,670
you know a benefit right to this

01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:40,750
discussion is sort of fits into that

01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:42,580
slot and just curious what your comments

01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:45,400
are there and you see this as a

01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:46,990
curriculum you know quality assurance

01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:49,720
curriculum whatever you want to call it

01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:51,760
an opportunity for educational

01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:54,640
institutions to capitalize on those

01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:56,830
smart people who are going to help right

01:01:54,640 --> 01:02:00,010
for the good of all ready all here for

01:01:56,830 --> 01:02:03,940
the next two days raising that an

01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:07,180
excellent question can you constrain the

01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:08,440
use of software particularly software

01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:11,200
when you're making the code available

01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:13,480
for others to modify use and

01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:17,910
redistribute can you constrain those

01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:20,890
changes to be changes only for good or

01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:24,110
as as you raise is that more of an

01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:26,600
educational issue we have in

01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:30,490
certainly here at seneca we've got

01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:33,710
ethics courses in some of our programs

01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:39,680
but not all of our software developments

01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:44,240
and system administration and hardware

01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:46,490
engineering courses should that be

01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:52,850
should that be mandatory piece do we

01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:56,330
need to you know build some frameworks

01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:58,730
as an industry for how we look at this

01:02:56,330 --> 01:03:07,480
in a standardized way how we evaluate

01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:11,840
the the good and bad angles for for

01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:14,570
hacking or modifying software so

01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:16,460
excellent questions and discussion

01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:18,860
points have been raised I would

01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:21,170
encourage you to think about these

01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:25,370
questions think about these issues as

01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:28,430
you attend the talks over the next two

01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:31,130
days and keep this discussion going

01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:34,660
let's have these conversations in the

01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:38,930
break room over coffee and lunch over

01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:41,750
over our meals and not let the future

01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:43,520
happen to us but make the future happen

01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:45,830
the way that we want it to you in the

01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:48,610
way that we needed to all right thank

01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:48,610
