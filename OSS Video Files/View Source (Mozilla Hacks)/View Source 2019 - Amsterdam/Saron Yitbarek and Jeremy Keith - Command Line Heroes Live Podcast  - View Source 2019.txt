00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:10,500

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,450
Hat we produce a podcast called command

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,840
line heroes and it is for open-source

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:22,590
developers IT architects insist admins

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:28,890

we want your feedback so later today we

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,680
are going to be at one of the

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,760
conversation corners right so at three

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,890
o'clock we're going to be a big

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,559
conversation corner and we want you to

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:12,540
and you can have your caricature drawn

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:14,280
and we have command line heroes socks to

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,759
giveaway so come by and get yourself

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,790
yeah that's right great all right so for

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,900
those who haven't heard the podcast

00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,240
command line heroes tells the epic

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,310
stories of people who transform

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,670
technology from the command line up

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:33,409
these are stories about how we got here

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:36,689
like the OS Wars the agile revolution

00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:38,909
containers the cloud committing code and

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:41,939
so much more and this is our third

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,759
season and it's all about programming

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:48,090
languages everything from Python to

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:52,700
basic to Pearl to JavaScript to COBOL

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:55,380
and go and see and our most popular

00:01:52,700 --> 00:02:00,570
episode this season can you guess what

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:02,799
it was COBOL I'm just kidding me it

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:08,440
wasn't COBOL

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:13,150
it was JavaScript so bye applause how

00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:16,290
many of you work with JavaScript wants

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:19,410
you to cheer yeah all right pretty good

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,670
but how much do you really know about

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,200
JavaScript so we're gonna test your

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,670
knowledge all right we're gonna test

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,049
your knowledge and we're gonna do a

00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:31,920
little pop quiz up on the screen so for

00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:34,780
each question I want you to applaud

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,170
whichever you think is the right answer

00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,060
all right so here's our first question

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:44,049
the first release of JavaScript was

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:52,349
created in how many days was it eight

00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:52,349
days nobody okay was it 10 days

00:02:52,440 --> 00:03:01,150
okay how about 22 days all right you'll

00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,760
find out the answer later nice question

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:06,389
so how many estimated JavaScript

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:11,319
developers are there in the world today

00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:13,510
what do you think 3 million really

00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:19,200
anybody all right

00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:25,000
20 2.8 million hey some people think so

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:27,280
how about ten point seven million hmm

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,069
all right last question the

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,870
object-oriented underlying pattern and

00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:37,470
JavaScript was taken from which

00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,470
programming language was it modular -

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,410
one person thinks that cool

00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:57,519
or Pascal a couple people okay cool all

00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:59,680
right so the answers to all these

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,220
questions are about to be revealed in

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,680
the show so pay attention we're about to

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:09,280
go deep into the language that most of

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,650
you engage with every day so presenting

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,610
a live performance of command-line

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:18,290
heroes three for season three episode

00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,290
three creating JavaScript

00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:30,649
[Music]

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,760
[Music]

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,310
all right so I mentioned this before but

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:50,170
we are going to be recording this

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:53,680
episode right here right now so actually

00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:56,080
our sound engineer Sean Cole over here

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,590
is going to be recording the episode and

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:04,870
he needs your help so we want to hear

00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:08,170
all of you in the episode and when we

00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:13,270
need you to applaud Sean is going to do

00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:15,330
this there you go nice right one more

00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,330
time

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:21,010
all right on with the show

00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:38,080
so presenting the host of command-line

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:41,380
heroes surronding bark Brendan Eich was

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,470
34 years old when he sat down at his

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:47,280
desk in Netscape's headquarters he was

00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:51,310
about to commit himself to a massive

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,070
ten-day sprint of coding to code a new

00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:57,850
language a whole new programming

00:05:54,070 --> 00:06:02,740
language in just 10 days

00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:07,680
it was 1995 and the world of programming

00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,680
languages was about to change forever

00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:15,610
I'm Saranya barik and this is command

00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:18,760
line heroes an original podcast for let

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:22,139
hat live from Amsterdam

00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,139
[Applause]

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:29,500
this podcast season we've been exploring

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:32,380
the power and promise of programming

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,990
languages how our languages shape our

00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:39,310
world of development and how they

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:41,890
supercharge our work in this episode we

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:44,650
are tracking the creation of JavaScript

00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:47,380
maybe you've heard the story of Brendan

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:51,190
Eich before but how does something like

00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:53,620
JavaScript really get created sure there

00:06:51,190 --> 00:07:00,580
was Brendan sprint but there's so much

00:06:53,620 --> 00:07:06,820
more to the story our tale begins in the

00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:10,660
midst of a war a browser war the browser

00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:13,510
Wars of the 1990s may seem like history

00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,670
but they were hugely consequential on

00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:18,370
one side of the battlefield

00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:22,270
Netscape they had formed an alliance

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:25,540
with Sun Microsystems on the other side

00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:28,060
you've got Microsoft software behemoths

00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:31,270
and the spoils they were fighting over

00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:34,090
it was a battle to decide who would be

00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:37,810
the gatekeeper of the Internet the

00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:40,270
stakes were huge the fight was over who

00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:43,030
was gonna be the main portal to going

00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:44,560
online you have to realize that in you

00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,590
know in the early 90s no one was really

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,830
online very much that's tech historian

00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:53,860
and author Clive Thompson Netscape

00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:56,440
realized the power the browser was this

00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:00,280
key piece of software that people could

00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:03,730
use to get online and look at the web so

00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:07,030
in late 1994 they offered a direct

00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:09,730
on-ramp and suddenly thousands and

00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:11,230
millions of people are able to use the

00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,880
Internet in this kind of graphical way

00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,860
they're just getting massive massive

00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,150
downloads and huge amounts of press and

00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,010
everyone's basically saying yeah

00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:20,220
Netscape is kind of the future of this

00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,960
thing called the Internet but Microsoft

00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:26,290
well their whole business model was

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,690
packaging stuff inside Windows they

00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:32,020
weren't really interested in browsers

00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:34,390
until they were Microsoft stuck their

00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:38,530
head out of the sand a year later and

00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:40,810
saw that the world was moving online but

00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:43,120
there was nothing inside of Microsoft

00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:45,550
Windows that could help them get there

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,310
all of a sudden Microsoft's

00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:52,780
industry-wide dominance doesn't look so

00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:56,710
solid and it's in that moment that the

00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:59,680
browser Wars begin the moment when

00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:02,590
Microsoft wakes up to the power of the

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,620
Internet and squints its eye at their

00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:08,830
new competition and there was a strong

00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,930
sense of first mover advantage that the

00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,310
first company that could sort of brand

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,410
themselves that's the way you get online

00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,370
would be the winner for years and years

00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,530
and maybe forever

00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,820
I remember how rapid the pace of

00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:21,100
development was I mean Netscape was

00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,870
putting on a new browser every couple of

00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,510
months Microsoft was accustomed to

00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:27,970
developing very slowly to really

00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:30,910
understand how the browser wars went

00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:33,280
down let's invite Jeremy Keith to the

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,180
stage Jeremy is the founder of

00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,270
clear:left

00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:39,520
a design studio in Brighton England he's

00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:42,280
also the author of what he likes to call

00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,050
are some books on web stuff come and

00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:53,110
join us Jeremy

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:53,110
[Applause]

00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,960
welcome to the show

00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:59,390
thank you for having me okay let's set

00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,390
the seed I'm a developer the web browser

00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:04,310
just came along what was that like well

00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:06,500
initially when the web came along the

00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,180
appeal to developers programmers we

00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,740
would have called him back then was in

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,090
making web browsers like when Tim

00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,950
berners-lee released the code for the

00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,600
web everyone was having a go making web

00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,550
browsers it was as many web browsers

00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,640
there were websites and in the early

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,710
days and mosaic was the one that kind of

00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,450
really led the way that was Marc

00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:25,670
Andreessen created that and that went on

00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:28,010
to become Netscape and suddenly there

00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,810
was appeal not just to developers as we

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:32,300
say now our programmers but to anyone

00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,920
that you could put something on the

00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,950
internet anyone could access it whether

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,680
you were an artist or a writer no matter

00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,970
what you could be heard tell me more

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,690
about that appeal what was so appealing

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,240
about it

00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:47,060
well the barrier to entry was relatively

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,690
low yes you had to learn as HTML stuff

00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:53,870
but if you could learn that then the

00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:55,250
access was was there I mean you you did

00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,390
have to have a computer you didn't have

00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,310
to have a modem you have to be able get

00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:01,100
online but it wasn't like you needed to

00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:02,990
know computer science in order to put

00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,700
something out there onto the web so

00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,830
Microsoft came onto the scene about a

00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:09,620
year later right so what was it about

00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:12,050
the browser that made Microsoft say we

00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,060
need to compete well Microsoft's history

00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:16,370
was in selling software distributing

00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:19,550
software and that used to be you know CD

00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:21,050
ROMs and you buy in a shop but I think

00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,640
they started to realize that the

00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:25,550
potential future was that people would

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,860
get their software online and if their

00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:30,050
business was software they needed to get

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,670
in on that Bill Gates famously wrote a

00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,590
memo effectively saying they'd been

00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,000
asleep at the wheel and then they were

00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,800
in this really interesting situation of

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,410
having to compete with Netscape who were

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,540
their main product was free they didn't

00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,890
even sell in that scape navigator so

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,890
here you have Microsoft who've made

00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,970
their money selling software putting all

00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,080
this effort into creating a piece of

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,960
software that was going to be

00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:53,090
distributed for free so we know that

00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,370
Microsoft's approach to building a

00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:56,959
browser is very different from

00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,220
from Netscape's approach so what was

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,379
that difference like tell me about that

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,810
well be honest a lot of the differences

00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:04,249
seem to be just pure spitefulness' like

00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,290
let's do things differently just because

00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:08,329
they're different so you know one

00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,019
browser would come up with an a new HTML

00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:10,999
element

00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,439
they'd make something up in order to do

00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:13,670
something on the web and the other

00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:15,350
browser would come up with a completely

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:17,870
different HTML element that would do the

00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:20,120
exact same thing just in order to have

00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,829
this competition it seemed like they

00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,569
almost wanted to force developers to

00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:25,639
choose which browser will you support

00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:26,839
rather than developers being in a

00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,730
position to be able to support both

00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:30,290
browsers well thank you so much for your

00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,279
insights you're gonna sit tight and

00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,870
we're gonna get back to you a little bit

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,379
later but for now we're gonna get back

00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,379
to our story

00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:48,189
all that heat around the potential of

00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:51,549
life in a browser had made one thing

00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:54,309
very clear we needed a new programming

00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:57,939
language something that went far beyond

00:12:54,309 --> 00:13:00,599
HTML we needed a language tailor-made

00:12:57,939 --> 00:13:03,699
for all that new web-based development

00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:10,319
we wanted a language that didn't just

00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:13,599
survive online but thrive there in a way

00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:17,169
Netscape was always the underdog in that

00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:20,139
battle but here's the thing before the

00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:23,559
battle was over they threw a beautiful

00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:26,499
Hail Mary this would become an

00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:32,889
incredible win for the whole world of

00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:35,649
programming so around the time that

00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:36,189
Microsoft decided to throw their hat in

00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:40,539
the ring

00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:43,179
Netscape took a closer look at Java was

00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:46,359
Java going to be the language for web

00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:50,499
development Java was this rich language

00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:54,069
it performed just as well as C++ but it

00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:56,009
did still need to be compiled developers

00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:58,019
wanted something more lightweight

00:13:56,009 --> 00:14:01,209
something that could be interpreted

00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:04,179
instead of compiled something that would

00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:09,220
appeal to all those new programmers that

00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:11,199
were swarming to the web netscape one of

00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,829
the programming language to bring static

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:18,399
web pages to life their dream to work

00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:21,039
directly on the web wouldn't it be great

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,739
they thought if they could release a new

00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:27,309
lightweight language that could run

00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:29,739
inside of the browser and wouldn't it be

00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:34,089
great if it worked right at the same

00:14:29,739 --> 00:14:40,869
time they released beta 2.0 there was

00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:46,749
only one hitch that gave them exactly 10

00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:51,519
days to create a new language actually

00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:54,119
it gave one guy Brendan Eich 10 days he

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,649
was the one tasked with pulling this off

00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:58,539
but there was no doubt that if anybody

00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:01,539
could do it he could

00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:04,209
that's because Brendan liked to create

00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:06,729
new languages for fun just to play

00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:09,189
around with syntax the key to Brendan

00:15:06,729 --> 00:15:12,579
Eich is that Brendan Eich when he built

00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:15,429
JavaScript had become sort of a language

00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:17,889
junkie that's Charles severance a

00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:21,639
professor at the University of Michigan

00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:23,679
School of Information JavaScript was

00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:27,509
sort of created an environment where

00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:31,600
Java was seen as the future and so in

00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:35,109
1994 we thought that it was the thing

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,299
was gonna solve everything one year

00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:39,669
later the thing that would actually

00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:41,439
solve everything was about to appear but

00:15:39,669 --> 00:15:43,809
it couldn't say hey I've solved

00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:48,220
everything because everybody myself

00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:50,319
included believed in 94 95 that we had

00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,329
seen the future of rock and roll and it

00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:54,999
was the java programming language they

00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:58,089
had to build a language that seemed

00:15:54,999 --> 00:16:02,489
irrelevant seem silly seemed meaningless

00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:07,329
and yet was the right solution on

00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:10,209
November 30th 1995 Netscape released

00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:15,399
this powerful little seed of a language

00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:18,699
inside of navigator 2.0 soon 28

00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:21,909
companies agreed to use it as an open

00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:24,410
standard language companies like AOL and

00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:27,510
AT&T

00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:31,800
but a lot of old pros looked down their

00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:34,260
noses at JavaScript they thought it was

00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:37,740
just a language for newbies a toy

00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:40,800
language they missed its revolutionary

00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:44,040
potential Brendan decided he would sneak

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,890
in all these super advanced concepts

00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,480
from languages that are not well known

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,790
that were very like advanced object

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,860
oriented languages and so so JavaScript

00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,910
is almost like a Trojan horse it's sort

00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,880
of sneaked into our collective

00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:58,770
consciousness with the idea that it was

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,680
silly and fun and easy and lightweight

00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:04,350
but then built in from almost the very

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,939
beginning was a powerful deeply thought

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,100
well-thought-out programming language

00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:10,800
that's capable doing literally almost

00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:13,829
anything in computer science but what I

00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:16,770
delivered was no toy language it was

00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:19,199
sophisticated in hidden ways it drew

00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:21,750
inspiration from languages that came

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,569
before it if you look at the basic

00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:27,240
syntax it's very clear that is inspired

00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:29,700
by the C language with its curly braces

00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,080
and semicolons some of the string

00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,280
patterns were taken from the Java

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,500
programming language but the

00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,990
object-oriented underlying patterns

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,150
taken from a programming language called

00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,760
modulo 2 which had this notion of

00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:43,650
first-class functions which to me is

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,450
really the one of the most amazing

00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,100
choices that made JavaScript such a

00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:48,690
powerful and extensible language and

00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,700
that is that a body of the function the

00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:53,670
code that makes up a function itself is

00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:56,190
also data and the other thing that

00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:59,130
really was a part of the inspiration was

00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:02,160
hypercard JavaScript was always running

00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:05,100
in a browser which meant it had a basic

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,690
data context of the document object

00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,540
model which is an object-oriented

00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,250
representation of a web page it is not

00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:14,250
like a traditional programming language

00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,600
the JavaScript code didn't start at the

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,150
beginning the first thing that it was

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,970
was a web page and so it ended up with

00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:23,610
this event oriented programming the

00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:26,340
result was a language native to the

00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:29,870
browser it could evolve as our online

00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:33,179
lives evolved it didn't take long before

00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:35,820
JavaScript became the de facto option

00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:37,440
for web development javascript was a

00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,860
language that I had no choices of what

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,659
to

00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,570
and literally people that learn

00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:43,529
JavaScript usually have no choice

00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,909
because they're like I want to build a

00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:46,440
browser application and I want it to

00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:48,389
have interactive elements and the answer

00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,460
is therefore you must learn JavaScript

00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:52,590
if you imagine like what is your

00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,989
favorite language the answer to that

00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:57,809
question is almost got to be X plus

00:18:54,989 --> 00:19:01,110
JavaScript right someone's might say I

00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:03,779
like Python and JavaScript or I like

00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:06,059
Scala and JavaScript because it's the

00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:09,109
one language everyone is required to

00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:11,850
learn Netscape came out the gate

00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:15,049
incredibly strong and they fought hard

00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:17,669
during the browser Wars but in the end

00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:21,239
Netscape Navigator disappeared as a

00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:24,109
serious product Microsoft was just too

00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:27,960
dominant Windows was the default

00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:30,960
software package on 80 to 90% of

00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:34,409
computers on the planet Explorer got

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,320
bundled into all of that despite being a

00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:40,320
year late to the browser game the

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:42,600
all-powerful Microsoft won the day yet

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:46,259
netscape's Hail Mary the creation of

00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:49,200
JavaScript was a success because long

00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:51,629
after the fight was over this language

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:56,609
would have an afterlife that changed

00:19:51,629 --> 00:19:59,399
everything let's say you're relatively

00:19:56,609 --> 00:20:00,989
new to web development you might take

00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:03,659
for granted that you can develop

00:20:00,989 --> 00:20:06,629
interactive web pages that can change

00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:09,119
and update and you don't need to pull a

00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:12,269
whole new copy of the page from the

00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:15,359
server and imagine for a second what it

00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:17,600
was like before you could do that when

00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:20,429
doing that was brand new

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,859
Michael client is a software engineer at

00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:26,999
Red Hat we asked him to help us

00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:31,799
understand what a huge shift that was in

00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:36,029
I want to say 2004 Google Mail was

00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:38,609
released Gmail and it was to my

00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:41,220
knowledge the first web application that

00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:44,580
really took JavaScript to the next level

00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:47,160
that used it to dynamically switch

00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:49,860
content out that you were looking at

00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:53,250
say you're looking at your inbox and you

00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:55,980
click on an email in the old days your

00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:58,350
email viewer would load a whole new page

00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,230
in your browser just to show you the

00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:05,850
email then you close that email and it

00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:07,230
would Li load the whole inbox it created

00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,640
a lot of latency there was a lot of

00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:11,370
waiting when you would switch back and

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,880
forth between views and Gmail changed

00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,910
all that

00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,890
they used javascript to in the

00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:18,810
background fetch the content that you

00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:21,240
wanted to view and just put it in front

00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:24,570
of you without you having to wait for a

00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:27,930
brand-new page view imagine how much

00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:31,440
time and energy you saved but it changed

00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:35,160
more than just the speed it changed the

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:39,290
very nature of our work so web developer

00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:41,520
as a job title has gone from being a

00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:44,580
server-side kind of behind the scenes

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,530
role to being just a very thin layer

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,600
away from the user since they're writing

00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:51,140
code directly in the browser that the

00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:54,240
user is viewing the web page through

00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:58,830
JavaScript pretty much assured in the

00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:01,260
web 2.0 revolution anyone with the web

00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:04,590
browser suddenly had a development

00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:06,960
environment right in front of them but

00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:10,170
as I mentioned before the old guard

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,490
wasn't having any of it they didn't like

00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:17,160
how things were getting so democratic

00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:20,490
that early antagonism of JavaScript I

00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:22,530
was part of that myself I had browser

00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:25,440
extensions that would prevent JavaScript

00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:29,100
from running I thought it was a useless

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,960
toy language and I kind of had this

00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,350
feeling of anger whenever I went to a

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:37,110
web page that had JavaScript required

00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:39,480
for some critical feature of the site I

00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:42,750
was like you should build your website

00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:45,630
the right way without JavaScript soon

00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:48,570
enough though the potential that Brendan

00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:52,290
Eich built into his 10-day language

00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:55,320
became obvious to everyone and now it's

00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:59,040
conquering not just the browser but the

00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,410
server too with nodejs a whole new

00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,770
territory for

00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:07,300
little language that could opened up

00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:09,850
first in the browser and then on servers

00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:12,770
JavaScript was this unpretentious

00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:15,770
secretly elegant sometimes buggy

00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:18,880
language a survivor from the browser

00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:21,650
wars that everybody underestimated

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,470
javascript has been kind of a Cinderella

00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:27,830
story of programming languages starting

00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:30,200
in that early state of being essentially

00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:32,150
whipped together in ten days going

00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,520
through a lot of derision from the rest

00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:36,980
of the programming community and still

00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,920
somehow continuing to find success and

00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:42,710
growth javascript is essentially

00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:45,620
everywhere the ability to run inside of

00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:48,410
a web page meant that javascript was as

00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:51,650
pervasive as the web is which is quite

00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:54,290
pervasive the more you look at the way

00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:57,470
JavaScript runs today the more you

00:23:54,290 --> 00:24:01,760
realize it's got its fingers in every

00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:04,730
part of our on-line life javascript rode

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,970
the coattails of the web to a kind of a

00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:11,510
language domination and with any kind of

00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:13,660
domination it got big and bloated it

00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:17,240
became something that powered entire

00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:20,270
applications even before you wanted it

00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:24,250
to nuisance things like pop-up ads and

00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:26,930
tracking JavaScript became all-consuming

00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:30,440
the language famous for being so

00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:34,010
lightweight now takes up a lot of space

00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:44,750
and energy and for that let's talk to

00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:47,390
Jeremy hi Jeremy that's right so I think

00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:49,280
that we can agree that JavaScript is

00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:52,400
basically eaten the world how do you

00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:55,400
feel about this on the one hand it is a

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,860
very feel-good Cinderella story but on

00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,610
the other Cinderella may have morphed

00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:03,410
into a wicked stepmother that has now

00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:06,560
crushed other languages in the browser

00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:08,780
under its heel like HTML and CSS which

00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,600
are great at what they do just as

00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:13,820
javascript is good at what it does but

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,119
yeah it seems like a lot of developers

00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,369
are

00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:18,529
treating JavaScript as the hammer and

00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:20,509
everything looks like a nail mm-hmm so

00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:22,579
javascript is a tool maybe maybe a

00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:24,739
hammer but we have many tools in our

00:25:22,579 --> 00:25:26,839
toolbox where does JavaScript sit in

00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:29,599
that toolbox well like I say I think I

00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:31,399
see it as part of this three layered

00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:33,339
approach to building on the web you have

00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:36,229
HTML for the content and the structure

00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:39,019
CSS for the styling and JavaScript for

00:25:36,229 --> 00:25:40,999
the behavior but javascript is so

00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:44,119
powerful that if you want you can use it

00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:46,939
to create you know document object model

00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:49,639
effectively not needing any HTML you can

00:25:46,939 --> 00:25:52,339
write Styles in JavaScript effectively

00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:54,799
not needing any CSS so if you want you

00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:58,549
can just use JavaScript to do everything

00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:00,859
but should you so you mentioned HTML and

00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:02,449
CSS are there other programming

00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:04,609
languages that we should think about

00:26:02,449 --> 00:26:06,649
when it comes to the web when it comes

00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:08,779
to programming in the web browser no

00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:11,029
JavaScript is it you kind of don't have

00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:12,349
a choice there have been some attempts

00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:14,299
to try and create alternatives to

00:26:12,349 --> 00:26:16,579
JavaScript in the web browser they never

00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:18,679
really worked out however you still have

00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:19,969
your web server and you can use anything

00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:21,619
you want there you can even use the

00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:24,109
JavaScript there now which is great but

00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:26,839
it's up to you if you want Ruby Python

00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:28,219
Perl whatever you want you can put a lot

00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:30,229
of the computation back on the server

00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:32,479
and do things with pretty much any

00:26:30,229 --> 00:26:34,969
language there so in an earlier episode

00:26:32,479 --> 00:26:37,099
we talked about Perl and how Perl has

00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:39,019
grown evolved and at this point kind of

00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:41,269
settled when you think about the growth

00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:43,099
and evolution of JavaScript where are we

00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:44,629
has it matured as it still got a lot to

00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:46,069
grow what are your thoughts it's almost

00:26:44,629 --> 00:26:48,259
the opposite story with JavaScript

00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:50,059
because it began kind of knowing its

00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:51,799
place which was in the web browser it

00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:54,499
was specifically for interacting with

00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:56,809
web pages but since then it's gone on to

00:26:54,499 --> 00:26:58,789
these new territories like servers and

00:26:56,809 --> 00:27:00,469
we get things like node and it's

00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:02,569
spreading in it you can be found in more

00:27:00,469 --> 00:27:05,149
and more places and along with that it

00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:07,279
has grown yes this evolution of the

00:27:05,149 --> 00:27:09,469
language itself it gets more and more

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,849
powerful features which in the one hand

00:27:09,469 --> 00:27:12,919
is great the people who used to look

00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:14,809
down their nose at this Toyland would

00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:16,999
now acknowledge maybe that it's got more

00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:18,979
powerful features but it kind of comes

00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:20,209
at a cost which you know that lower

00:27:18,979 --> 00:27:23,749
barrier to entry that came with the

00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:25,369
simpler toy language that that buyer

00:27:23,749 --> 00:27:26,440
tantras been raised I think now which is

00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:29,200
a bit of a shame

00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:31,000
so not that long ago you could block

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,130
JavaScript when you're using the browser

00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,510
and it wasn't a big deal maybe it be you

00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,870
know a little inconvenient it was no big

00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:37,000
deal

00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:38,260
nowadays it feels like if you try and

00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,420
block JavaScript you're gonna have a

00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:42,730
tough time so it feels like we're very

00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:45,570
dependent on JavaScript when it comes to

00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:47,770
using the web is that a bad thing

00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:50,620
frankly yes

00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:52,510
it's there's a lot of things being used

00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,220
for that you need to use JavaScript for

00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:55,690
okay fine the more you know heavy

00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,640
application like things sure but

00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:59,980
javascript is also being used to do

00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,630
things that really you could use HTML

00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,670
for just rendering some text on a screen

00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:05,320
and some people have experimented with

00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,450
switching off JavaScript today and

00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,400
browsing the web and documenting their

00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,990
findings and surprising there are some

00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,070
things that you you still can do you

00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,500
know the websites to really pay

00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:16,030
attention to resilience will make sure

00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,220
that you can at least accomplish the

00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:20,590
core functionality without JavaScript

00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,850
which is quite heartening well thank you

00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:33,220
so much Jeremy we've got one more

00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:35,230
question for you so sit tight we can

00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,810
thank JavaScript for Google Docs for

00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:41,290
YouTube for Netflix and it's pushed

00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:44,800
along by a huge number of open source

00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:46,960
libraries / data's most recent estimate

00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:50,670
of the number of JavaScript developers

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:54,400
in the world is ten point seven million

00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:58,270
over at github javascript has more pull

00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:00,820
requests than any other language power

00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:03,760
lies with the whole world of

00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:07,720
command-line heroes helping Java Script

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,940
grow like all of you out there Jeremie

00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,610
given all of that when you think about

00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,240
the future of the web and the future of

00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,770
JavaScript

00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,280
what is that future look like what do

00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:20,500
you hope for moderation is what I hope

00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,030
for I think we've gone a bit crazy with

00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,400
JavaScript and I would love to see

00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:27,490
people treat JavaScript as the powerful

00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,410
tool it is but as part of a toolbox of

00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:33,540
other equally powerful languages like

00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:33,540
HTML and CSS thank you

00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:39,060
it's worth taking a step back and

00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:43,050
remembering here just a couple decades

00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:46,250
ago in 1995 brendan eich was sitting in

00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:49,890
a room hammering out a new language and

00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:53,700

00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:56,130
we do it might sound a bit cliche to say

00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,550

00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:01,590

00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:09,250

00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:12,470

00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:15,060
