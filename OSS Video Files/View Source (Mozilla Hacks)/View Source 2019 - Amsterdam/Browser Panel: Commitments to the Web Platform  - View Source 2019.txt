you are wonderful mcs of the day and as

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,860
a manager I'm familiar with delegation

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,900
so I'm actually going to delegate

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:17,670
introductions to everybody on the panel

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:20,640
but first just intro myself so I work

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,859
for a Samsung internet I'm lead the

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,900
developer advocacy team I also co-chair

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,550
something called the w3c tag technical

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:31,650
architecture group and I'm on the

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:35,160
Mozilla or mdn product advisory board as

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,350
well so I had I'm very really honored to

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:42,570
be able to be part of this event today

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:44,879
just by my way of introduction or by way

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,680
of setting the scene this morning on

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,780
Reid talked about collaboration

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,510
I really I really like that he also

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,300
talked about respect I like to say the

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,620
web is agreement you can't really have

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:01,980
agreement without collaboration and

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:06,390
respect so last week in Japan we had w3c

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:09,659
tea pack meeting many people were who I

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,189
see here we're also at tea pack it's a

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,570
but for those of you who weren't or

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,720
don't know what it is it's a big yearly

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,310
multi group meeting that w3c runs in

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,680
which people come together from across

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,509
different stakeholders of the web

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,009
including browsers people who work for

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:27,090
big companies individual contributors

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:29,280
web developers etc everyone there was

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,799
there to collaborate Kadir from mbn

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,790
actually presented some of the

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,970
preliminary results from the indium

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:39,090
developer needs assessment amongst other

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,079
really valuable insights those results

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,060
highlighted the importance of

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,850
interoperability interoperability

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,229
between browsers that led to a lot of

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,509
discussions about Interop and how

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:52,799
important that is for the web and for

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:54,479
for to work across browsers in the w3c

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,310
tag we also recently published something

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,909
called the ethical web principles

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,219
anybody hear of it a couple of hands ok

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,899
great one of those ethical web

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:08,459
principles is that the web is multi

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:10,289
browser multi device multi-os so today

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,880
we're gonna try and channel some of that

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:14,830
energy some of that collaboration

00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,570
passion for collaboration into today's

00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,270
panel where we're going to be talking

00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:22,120
about future of the web browser the

00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,310
future different visions we hold and the

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,070
priorities we all have we're gonna have

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,170
a discussion up here but we have limited

00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:31,210
time so you should think about this as

00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,830
the beginning of a conversation you

00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:36,040
should come find us find us in the

00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,150
breaks find us over lunch come finish

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,910
the discussions that we're going to

00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,270
start up here with that I'm gonna shut

00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,420
up

00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,560
promise and I'm gonna ask each of our

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,530
panelists to briefly introduce

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,880
themselves and tell us what they're

00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,480
working on and what they're excited

00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:54,100
about bringing to the web so you might

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,140
have seen me talk like a little bit ago

00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,570
but I'm Melanie Richards I'm on the

00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,800
Microsoft edge web platform team the

00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,600
cool thing about the web is that there's

00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,010
like so much to explore and I've

00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,600
actually done like quite a few things on

00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,640
the edge team I originally joined as a

00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,250
designer developer working on developer

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,530
experiences so more recently I've been

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,800
working as a p.m. on the web platform

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:17,260
directly working on accessibility

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,110
projects such as high contrast and

00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,390
bringing UI automation to the open

00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,610
source projects things like that and

00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,440
very very recently will be joining some

00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,410
of my colleagues working on privacy

00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,060
projects so you know I did just talk

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:34,150
about high contrast but I'm actually

00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,860
really excited about it so we've

00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,990
actually wanted to standardize this

00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,790
techniques for a while and moving to

00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:42,130
open-source for our rendering engine has

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,960
provided us a really excellent excuse to

00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,180
like get that started that conversation

00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,710
started again so really happy to see

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,770
that moving into the standards bodies

00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:52,840
soon all right

00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,430
so my name is Kenji I'm actually French

00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,940
I have a Japanese name it's very long

00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:00,040
story it explains a lot of like what

00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,650
I've been ended up doing which is I

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,020
actually live in Japan I used to work

00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,730
for a very like traditional Japanese

00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,630
company called sharp referring since

00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:12,700
what was building like smartphones

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:15,280
things that we were hoping that Nintendo

00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:18,880
would use and then for some odd reasons

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,609
I moved on to Google and my main focus

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,330
has been on loading making things load

00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:26,979
fast and I think I'm going to say that I

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,960
care about making connections go

00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:32,560
gangster that's the better way of like

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,510
framing what I do and so lately I've

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,450
been working on web packaging and Polo's

00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:39,940
which are api's that we hope can can

00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:41,560
make do is like connection even if they

00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,570
are not gangster make make them look

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,580
like they are so that's what I've been

00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,830
doing

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,600
hi I'm DS Shinya I'm actually South

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,640
African but I'm based in London

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,530
my wife is Dutch so there's a connection

00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:58,300
here my kids are English and confused

00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:59,830
and I'm generally a troublemaker I've

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,810
spent the longest time almost two

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:05,800
decades in home world

00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:08,110
usual suspects eBay PayPal BBC and then

00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,990
spent the longest time at Mozilla and

00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:13,050
Firefox from Firefox 3.8 so sorry

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,610
Mozilla labs only about a hundred people

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:18,729
have only left Mozilla about a year ago

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:22,630
but I'm still closely involved with the

00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:24,070
web today I'm an individual advisor for

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,169
early-stage startups and technology

00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,450
startups but the thing that keeps me

00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:30,660
close to the web is working a new

00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:33,610
standard called web monetization

00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:37,960
alongside a protocol called IntelliJ and

00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:40,120
that's hoping to make content creators

00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,620
better remunerated on the web as opposed

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,880
to some other traditional methods that

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,740
are in front of them today which are ad

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,140
networks subscriptions paywalls

00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,580
taking your data and selling it on so

00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,970
that's the stuff that's that's keeping

00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:55,180
me super excited and in the last 10 days

00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:57,729
or so we announced a hundred million

00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,940
dollar grant there's a lot of zeroes

00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:03,580
there in collaboration that word again

00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,900
with Creative Commons and with Mozilla

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,610
and we're hoping to bring other

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,289
not-for-profits into bought into on

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,960
board and we'll be distributing this

00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:13,870
money to content creators out there so

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:18,250
web developers a good early audience but

00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:20,860
think wider field hey everybody my name

00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:23,289
is Matt nursery I am from Toronto Canada

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,789
originally from Damascus Syria and my

00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:25,780
wife is actually from South Africa so

00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:28,400
there's a completely irrelevant

00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:32,480
connection for you

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:35,890
I'm the CTO of NPM I'm super excited

00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,570
about the supply chain and the

00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:40,010
sustainability of it the thing that I'm

00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,050
most interested in is how do we

00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,180
facilitate access developers all around

00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,620
the world so topics like performance and

00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,390
documentation is Andriy was talking

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,280
about this morning are very interesting

00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,790
to me and it's a personal passion of

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,830
mine too I give the developer experience

00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:56,780
growth and access for folks not just

00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,640
speaking English or North American

00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,050
countries or Western countries but all

00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,880
around the world because the the

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,280
experiences that we are all creating

00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,420
here are shared experiences for the rest

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,010
of our colleagues all around the world

00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:11,150
and we should be able to reach out and

00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:13,850
learn from them as much as we can hi

00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,700
everyone my name is andreas Bothans I

00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,050
work at Mozilla there's actually talking

00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,110
about connections I used to live in

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,310
Japan for many years and then I lived in

00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,070
Norway where I worked for an other

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,620
browser vendor and so since 2 years I

00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:31,220
live in London I work for Mozilla I am

00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:33,380
platform lead lead a team of amazing

00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,600
product managers that focus on all

00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,690
things gecko geckos the rendering engine

00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,900
at the heart of Firefox and so with

00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:45,170
people working on runtime rendering

00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:47,030
add-ons dev tools new form factors

00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:50,510
things like VR browsers and things like

00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:53,170
that I'm so very excited to be here and

00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:55,460
one of the the things I'm really

00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:58,730
passionate about and have been focusing

00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:02,390
a lot over the last two years or so is a

00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:05,060
project called gecko view gecko view you

00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:09,350
can think of it as the Gecko engine but

00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:11,270
repackaged or packaged for use as a as

00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,010
an as a component in Android

00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,930
applications so if you build a browser

00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:17,780
or if you build an application that

00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:21,080
somehow needs a web engine you can

00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:23,000
plug-in gecko view and so we're trying

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,520
to make it really easy to use for other

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,900
folks to build browsers with and of

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,330
course also for ourselves who's been

00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,760
rethinking our mobile products mobile

00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:34,820
browser and also we've been working on a

00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,209
VR browser all of those are powered by

00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,279
gecko view and so

00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:41,729
yeah this is something I'm really

00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:45,089
excited about hi everyone I'm heating

00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:48,420
tone from Samsung and I am working on

00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:53,459
Samsung internet development for like

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:58,019
web engine features maybe and I have

00:08:53,459 --> 00:09:02,639
been working on browsers for about eight

00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:05,399
nine years all that Samsung so my life

00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:08,879
is like less exciting than all of yours

00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:11,339
anyways and so recently we have been

00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,470
working on progressive web apps and web

00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:16,470
payments and it's really important for

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:19,980
Samsung because we produce like various

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:22,980
devices with various OSS on them and web

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:27,059
is very I mean the platform that we can

00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:30,389
rely on to provide interoperability and

00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:41,160
consistency to our users so that's what

00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:44,160
I'm most excited about right now for my

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,709
part I'm from the US but I live in

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:53,389
London so I have the privilege of being

00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:55,769
part of two wonderful countries the

00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:59,009
agent you mentioned progressive web apps

00:09:55,769 --> 00:10:01,019
I think that's one in some discussions

00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:05,249
prior to the panel that's one thing that

00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:08,490
we all really touched on is there

00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:11,759
anything you do you want to talk about

00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:15,420
web APK a bit or is that something that

00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:17,939
you yeah I've been working on maybe

00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,850
March begin starting from March we

00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:24,509
started supporting web apks in our

00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:29,519
Android for Android browser and it's

00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:33,420
just it lets users and saw pwace as

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:37,730
native apps on Android phones and it's I

00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:40,679
think it helps in increasing engagement

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:45,149
to the web contents and you know lets

00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:50,160
users like manage their privacy settings

00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:54,449
more easily but one unfortunate thing

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,790
that we had to like vanish well-managed

00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:57,600
with was that we had to rely on the

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,209
store

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,049
I mean app store to make that happen so

00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:08,249
we only support let me keep web apks on

00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:11,819
Galaxy phones with Android N and above I

00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:15,899
hope we somehow find a way to expand

00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:17,370
that to all Android phones and another

00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:21,169
thing we're working on these days is

00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:24,509
trying to find a way to make more well

00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:26,339
make Peter Blaise more discoverable so

00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:30,049
inside Samsung we're working with other

00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:34,709
teams to see where we can show more

00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:37,259
suggest more web apps to users and well

00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:40,169
it's pretty difficult because in the

00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:44,429
open web it's like given that we can

00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:51,660
just link to other websites but in

00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:54,089
stores there are like so we need consent

00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:57,389
from the author or something and we need

00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:59,399
to get consent for like using their

00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:02,129
logos so we're trying to figure out what

00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:05,369
the best part I mean what the best way

00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:07,980
is for that these you mentioned web

00:12:05,369 --> 00:12:11,579
gaming to me and web games seems to be

00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:14,519
another area that has similar challenges

00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:16,230
to that's overlapping with the kind of

00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,089
progressive web app story do you want to

00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,999
talk a little bit about that yeah I

00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:24,419
think web games or html5 games is a

00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:28,619
really good use case for for progressive

00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:31,019
web apps as such you know we I played a

00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:33,929
big part many years ago in trying to

00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:37,049
deprecated flash from from the web so

00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:41,429
think back to Emscripten

00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:43,829
and what's now webassembly etc so the

00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:46,619
thing that that strikes me though is

00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:48,629
that the technical challenges will catch

00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:50,290
up to native right which is why a lot of

00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:53,019
the game developers move

00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:55,480
to the native platforms and and we will

00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:56,800
share solve things like shared array

00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,269
buffers and threading and all of those

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,100
things that the game is care about I can

00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:02,920
see cash first somewhere in the input

00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,779
from pokey going on to me about that but

00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,310
the thing that was still around maybe

00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:07,839
three or four years ago that people game

00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,670
developers asked indie game developers

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,959
asked for was two things discoverability

00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:15,819
and monetization and up to today those

00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,319
two things are still not solved and

00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:19,630
they're kicked back to me was someone

00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:21,279
like well you talk about the web right

00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,810
like you have all these great search

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:27,009
engines but I still can't get my game

00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:29,110
discovered and so on that front you know

00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:31,240
when I came away from the w3c web games

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:34,389
workshop in Seattle

00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,610
a few months ago Tom Green away from the

00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:39,040
chrome team is certainly looking at

00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,269
discoverability for web games and trying

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,910
to incorporate with some of the existing

00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:44,740
work with schema.org and those sorts of

00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,920
pieces and then on the monetization

00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:50,470
effort web monetization something I'm

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,170
working on with the team at at coil and

00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:56,529
intellectual community is something that

00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:59,680
we hope to help to solve for that we're

00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:02,470
seeing some early positive steps let's

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,649
say I think Andres is here Andres is the

00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:07,569
founder of GS 13 K which ran for the

00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:09,279
last month or so so that's indie web

00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:11,110
game developers trying to make a fully

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,630
fledged game in under 13 kilobytes which

00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:16,510
is pretty impressive in itself but today

00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:20,639
in this this last month he introduced a

00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:23,170
new category called web monetization and

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,350
somewhat even to me surprisingly we've

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:29,050
had over 50 entries in web monetization

00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:31,269
category and they are super interesting

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,860
games and as I'm playing these games I'm

00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:34,839
actually streaming money to these

00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,810
content owners and developers in real

00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:39,939
time you know game developers tell me

00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:42,459
that you know I put my games out I hope

00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:44,589
to make some money maybe in six months I

00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:48,250
get a check for 50 Cent's I don't even

00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:50,259
know if that checks going to come you

00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:54,009
know he did this on a weekend with one

00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:55,689
of his games and you know he I am me the

00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:58,510
weekend after instance like I've already

00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:59,740
got money in my account and I think

00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,880
that's that's amazing right the

00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:08,300
enthusiasm is there any other

00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:10,220
thoughts around monetization I'm really

00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:13,009
excited to see this kind of evolved as

00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,720
well I'm like thinking about publishing

00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:18,920
right you know you get these like huge

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,350
pay walls you know it's there's like can

00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,620
be a high barrier to entry to engage

00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:26,569
with content and so you see that like I

00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,850
don't know web monetization and micro

00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:30,290
payments could make it easy to say okay

00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,870
I want to read this specific article

00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:35,630
from here or this one from over here and

00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:39,440
you can see how like this could lead to

00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:41,420
you know better privacy preserving ways

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,940
of making money on the web you know cuz

00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,529
today the model that we have to me

00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,660
personally feels like it's not totally

00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:49,990
working for everybody like all this cash

00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:53,060
is flowing through like the ad business

00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:55,490
and so it'd be like really cool to find

00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,800
other ways to support creators on the

00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:00,079
web in ways that are open and

00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,910
transparent and people I think

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,889
individuals feel really good actually

00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:06,040
about saying like I love your content

00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:09,620
like here like I want to support you so

00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:13,670
yeah creatives when they when they make

00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:15,889
that content they you know if they can

00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:18,410
make some money like today the only

00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:21,110
choices are an ad network or

00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,670
subscription or paywall we have to give

00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:25,759
them more choices and so things like

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:27,199
patreon and brave and the stuff we're

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,990
doing with coil and web monetization

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:32,329
start putting more choices in there I

00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:37,639
think to see a lot of innovation

00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:39,529
happening in that space at Mozilla we

00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:42,139
also see this this problem with you know

00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:44,389
ads everywhere and users don't like at

00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:48,170
there's all this pervasive tracking and

00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:49,790
so on to put in tracking protection but

00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:53,240
you also see like the the whole the

00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:55,459
whole model of sort of ad based or

00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,959
ad-supported content it's you know

00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:59,120
they're still probably a place for it

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,339
but there's it's also there's also seems

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,760
to be room for something else so and

00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:07,280
this is the partnership with with Coyle

00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,140
was already mentioned earlier but Monza

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,669
has also been experimenting with a

00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:15,439
partnership with scroll whereby we're

00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:15,740
trying to find alternative ways to sort

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,920
of

00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:21,980
you do payments or like micro payments

00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:27,589
on the web and and and you know where

00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:29,480
users give small well sign up for a sort

00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,490
of subscription and then they get access

00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,620
to the pieces of content that otherwise

00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,910
would be ad supported so these are some

00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,160
of the things we're experimenting with

00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:39,710
but it's it's also problem Mozilla is

00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:46,610
very keen on on solving or helping to

00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:50,740
solve so the first time I when I was in

00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:55,160
Japan it was the whole I mode like fury

00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:57,800
and sure it's like a wall garden right

00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,870
but if you look at it essentially it was

00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:03,080
made of two things it was made of like

00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:06,380
web like content it was a subset of HTML

00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:08,210
I don't see any hot JavaScript so it was

00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,040
very simple but it worked very well

00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,780
entire user experience for the device

00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,880
that you had at the time and then for

00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,940
the more interactive experience it was

00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,740
based on Java at the very inner thing

00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,760
there even like hot flash which was a

00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:23,360
big mistake

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:26,150
in my book but the good thing they got

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,130
going was the payment the the way people

00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:29,660
will like browse and like disk of

00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:32,240
interesting things whether it's like

00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,070
content or games so they got the

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,760
discovery going on but also the payment

00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:40,280
it was interpreted with your like mobile

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,630
connection provider and at least in

00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,910
Japan it worked really well like people

00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:46,040
did pay for things and so there was no

00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:50,240
much for them I remember a lot of like

00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:51,890
add black supported things so it's not

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,270
like the web is not meant to work with

00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:57,500
these things that they are think we

00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:59,840
could do better and on discovery it's

00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,220
not just for web games like we hear from

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,770
partners that they care a lot about

00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,960
discovery especially on mobile because

00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:07,429
unlike desktop and laptops by people

00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,840
when you use their mobile device they

00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:10,940
want to be entertained most of the time

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,440
it's very rare where they have something

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,660
in mind and they are going to search for

00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,420
it and like find it it's more kind of

00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,830
like passive user experience and I think

00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,650
there is more things we could do there

00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:23,929
as well we're trying to create something

00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,550
with it's organic right you should just

00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:28,100
continue surfing the web as you normally

00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,880
do and not think oh I should go to this

00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,460
site what

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,990
at site and as you're doing it because

00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,460
you want to support content creators

00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:37,970
this automatically happens in the

00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:41,600
background so today that works with our

00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:44,120
service with something that's built in

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,890
with the browser extensions but

00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,750
hopefully working understand it this

00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,490
just becomes default and baked into the

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,950
browsers and then you don't have to

00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:54,440
think I want to give this create a $0.50

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:57,110
or that article two cents it's just

00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,390
happening in real time and I mean you

00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,860
know when we've got people that probably

00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,810
a lot of you know out there in the

00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:05,780
audience you know whether that's Chris

00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:09,200
coil over at CSS tricks and and david

00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:11,090
walsh blog and a number of others that

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,350
are already playing around experimenting

00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,570
with this i think that becomes really

00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:16,640
interesting and you're not thinking

00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:19,160
right you just hit a site and suddenly

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,050
you're sending them a few pennies but

00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,900
that adds up it's interesting because i

00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:26,750
think in the early days of the web when

00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:29,630
I was first doing web

00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:31,460
Topol widgets again all right no this is

00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:35,150
way back before then I mean we're

00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:37,100
talking like Oh Bruce is he a table

00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:40,550
widgets with him tables are new you know

00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:42,020
that kind of thing kind of era we you

00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,880
know we really thought like

00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,830
micropayments is going to be like a key

00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,190
part of the web and it never really

00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:52,070
happened so it's interesting to see you

00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:56,540
know new new initiatives around that I

00:20:52,070 --> 00:21:00,770
think cities the privacy aspect a little

00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:05,270
bit more it's also we've been seeing a

00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:08,300
lot happen with innovation around

00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:09,830
privacy and I mean you you are doing

00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,240
some stuff around privacy and maybe we

00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:16,070
can talk a little bit more about about

00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:17,810
that Eric that aspect yeah so we're

00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:19,550
really excited actually to see like

00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:21,260
really how much activity there is in the

00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:23,360
standards bodies today around privacy

00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,330
like so many of us coming together with

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,610
like here's an idea here's an

00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:29,529
what if we did it this way and I think

00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,809
this is like really interesting bachelor

00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:33,789
problems that will require like all over

00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:36,519
all of our creativity you know

00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:38,440
collectively a to address so I think you

00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:41,080
know we're kind of early in our journey

00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,489
really thinking about privacy and and

00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,340
how to address these issues on the web

00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:48,159
and I think first we kind of wanted to

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:50,399
come at it like before we start really

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,769
deep diving in the technical solutions

00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:54,940
we wanted to start by just understanding

00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:57,369
like what is the promise that we're

00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,840
making to our users and so we feel like

00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:00,070
it's going to take a while to work

00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,450
through all these things and so we need

00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:05,470
to like self-police a little bit and so

00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:07,059
internally we're kind of framing this is

00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,129
like a Hippocratic oath you know it's

00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:11,190
like what are we promising folks you

00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:13,869
know and the pillars of this of our

00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:15,220
transparency so we want to make sure and

00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:18,609
there's users understand what's

00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:21,730
happening we want control so put the

00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:24,609
users in control of you know any privacy

00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:26,440
preserving techniques we want to respect

00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:29,200
to the user and their choices and we

00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,269
want to protect their important data so

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,489
one of the first projects that you know

00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:36,039
we've been working on in this privacy

00:22:33,489 --> 00:22:38,109
preserving space is attracting

00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:41,080
prevention so we kind of have this like

00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:43,960
balanced view on by default in preview

00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:47,230
versions of Microsoft edge today that

00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:50,309
will you know block storage access from

00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:54,399
you know certain types of trackers and

00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:57,850
it will block resource request some

00:22:54,399 --> 00:23:00,309
other trackers from allowing them to you

00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:02,980
know get access to your data and then

00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:05,169
there's also like more strict you know

00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,279
settings that you can use so we're also

00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:08,379
looking at you know some of the new

00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:10,359
proposals are coming out we're starting

00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:12,609
to work on the storage access API within

00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:14,200
the open source projects and we're

00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:18,759
really excited to partner with everybody

00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:21,730
on this so that you in our discussions

00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:23,679
you mentioned to me something which I

00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:26,109
really it wasn't on my radar which was

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:30,460
like about how dependencies can

00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:32,499
sometimes impact privacy because of code

00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:34,299
modules is that something you could talk

00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:35,470
to yeah absolutely as we're heading into

00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:39,019
a world where

00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:41,299
the the modern web facilitates for you

00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:43,100
know fast loading of modules or packages

00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:44,929
or hyperlink into something and actually

00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:48,350
using a widget that's embedded in your

00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:49,519
website not that kind of widget like the

00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:52,309
modern web is all about web components

00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,749
all about reuse is all about sharing you

00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:55,970
know so we have a developer economy

00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:58,820
where you know you you build a you know

00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:00,409
forgit or a component of some sort and

00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,970
it's used by hundreds of thousands

00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:04,850
people have not billions of people if it

00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:06,230
gets notoriety or maybe it's embedded as

00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:08,659
part of a product that you're also

00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:10,730
reselling and other people are using so

00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:12,230
like the the network effect of that and

00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:14,929
by that what I mean is the actual

00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:17,389
network like the the URL and the web

00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:19,070
around it the model of security there

00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:20,539
doesn't translate very well if you're if

00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:22,429
you're loading things remotely and/or

00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:25,309
you're doing things on the fly

00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:27,739
we talk a lot about privacy and access

00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:29,269
controls and you know levels of user

00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:30,529
interaction that deal with the domain

00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:32,359
that you're on but when you're doing

00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:35,389
things externally and trying to bring in

00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:38,989
context maybe you've allowed a credit

00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:40,730
card level access to a domain that was

00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:42,019
using a widget from a third party but

00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,489
now you're on this other domain it's

00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:46,070
malicious it happens to use that same

00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:47,299
widget you know maybe you've implicitly

00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,309
allowed that permission to transfer

00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:50,659
through so there's all these complexity

00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:52,669
layers that we have to start thinking

00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:55,489
about where we as developers are using

00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:58,309
third-party tools or packages or

00:24:55,489 --> 00:24:59,629
services for that matter so it's not

00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:01,789
enough to think and worry about our own

00:24:59,629 --> 00:25:04,070
kind of user experience using the the

00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:06,200
business logic that we created it's also

00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,700
when you adopt and use libraries or

00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,409
tools or packages or you know

00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,299
third-party content how does that

00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:13,970
translate you know a big pattern today

00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:16,580
is using you know services like

00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:18,919
unpackage or CD nsj or others just to

00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:21,320
bring in some CSS and we've seen I think

00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:23,389
recently where even even CSS can be used

00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:27,320
to maliciously attack the target website

00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:28,940
that the visitor is on right so thinking

00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,440
of that experience as a developer is a

00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,690
thing we don't talk about it now is

00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:36,170
there more browsers need to do to help

00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:38,240
protect users when you know

00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:39,740
from from those types of attacks is

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,230
there more that that we could be doing

00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:53,900
on the on the browser side I'm looking

00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:56,030
at browsers providing well app lockers

00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,190
and truckin blockers third-party

00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:02,170
tracking blockers as an extension

00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:05,929
framework for a few years till now and

00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:08,720
early this year we started working on a

00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:11,660
feature called Smart anti tracking that

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,480
we use on device machine learning to

00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:19,250
figure out if this third-party domain is

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:22,600
trying to track you and I think users

00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:27,320
are we're also trying to educate users

00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:31,190
what that means to them and we recently

00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:34,280
saw that users are actually turning it

00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:37,880
on more and more so I'm happy to see

00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:40,130
that trend and we hope to like in has

00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:43,040
actually the machine learning part and

00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:47,260
add more features to protect the users

00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:49,970
security and privacy more also in

00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:52,580
Firefox we're shipping tracking

00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:54,950
protection in recent versions it's it's

00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:58,280
turned on by default actually so we

00:26:54,950 --> 00:27:04,070
track a number of so we we block a

00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:07,850
number of trackers and also crypto

00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:09,679
currency miners crypto miners by default

00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:11,450
and so you can the user has a choice

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,760
between the default settings or the

00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:15,650
strict settings allows which also block

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,990
finger printers so we're experimenting

00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:21,350
with on mobile to be a little bit more

00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:23,840
aggressive we feel there there is the

00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:26,330
problem with if you block a lot content

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,730
might break and so this is like a

00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:30,650
delicate balance you have to balance

00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:33,110
side compatibility and and user

00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:37,309
expectations there with providing

00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:38,990
adequate privacy protections and so this

00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:40,549
this balance is often tricky we feel

00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:43,340
there's a little bit more leeway perhaps

00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:45,590
on mobile we we see there that it is it

00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:47,000
is possible there to ramp up the

00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,570
settings a bit and provide even more

00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,340
protection

00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:56,940
and so we also recently over working on

00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:59,520
a as Melanie also said like it's

00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,260
important to show to users what is going

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,820
on or what we're doing for them so

00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,040
there's now an about Protection's page

00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:08,160
where you can see how many trackers have

00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,510
been blocked and and you know users can

00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,850
actually understand what's going on

00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:14,070
under the hood so it's yeah I think

00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:15,570
there's you mentioned a keyword machine

00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:17,700
learning I think there's definitely a

00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:19,410
lot of opportunities there because you

00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,780
know the the the level of supply chain

00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:24,120
attacks that you know we see at NPM and

00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,980
you know we have many examples where

00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,500
we're in the past we had to intervene

00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,940
and or take things off it's different

00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,950
when it's on the web right like it's

00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,630
it's when it's in your node modules and

00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:35,430
we take things offline because they were

00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:37,350
malicious or maybe a user decided to

00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:39,510
take off their package you know like the

00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,920
left bad incident it does affect

00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,870
millions of developers but it doesn't

00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,180
affect the users right it affects the

00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:47,070
developers who are relying on you know

00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,390
the tools and the packages but what's on

00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:50,310
the web it's already distributed and

00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,690
there's so many layers of caches so many

00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:53,970
layers of whether it's network level

00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:56,700
cache or you know the edge caching that

00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:58,350
we all have and you know distributed

00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,430
nature of the web doesn't facilitate for

00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,570
that but I think that's where things

00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:03,180
like machine learning are a good

00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:04,830
opportunity for us to kind of tackle it

00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,450
from both ends like even if something is

00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,670
detected and removed from the source

00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:10,440
that's you know at some point it's

00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:11,940
distributed already so how do you

00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,130
capture it from the other side from the

00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,570
user side maybe that's an operating

00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,970
system level maybe it's a browser level

00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:19,320
I don't know but it's interesting to me

00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:21,660
to start thinking about those models

00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,160
because you know there's only so much we

00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,800
can do for example and taking something

00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:28,140
it's malicious off our registry off you

00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,460
and as a developer your responsibility

00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:32,270
is now removed but then how do you

00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,590
translate that back to the user

00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:37,350
generally like privacy is hard right

00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:39,060
pristine security is hard yeah that's

00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:41,100
why we get involved in it right it's if

00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:43,320
it was you know if we just want to get

00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:46,710
around it we could do lots of cool stuff

00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:48,450
very quickly I mean even uncle Bruce

00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,010
he's someone yeah Bruce Lawson joined me

00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:52,170
a few months ago and the first thing he

00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:55,770
did was like rewrite the privacy policy

00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:57,930
101 times because it is hard and it's

00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:59,700
easy to forget about these things

00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,710
but even as we were playing around I

00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,200
think Stefan's here

00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:05,480
we found an interesting side effect with

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:09,230
web monetization that it even kicks in

00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,820
in Inc incognito mode right which means

00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:12,590
that you could be an incognito mode but

00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,570
still giving back to content creators

00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:16,760
that you that you respect sure because

00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:23,660
of the anonymous aspect of it right yeah

00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:25,490
okay we may want to shift tracks to talk

00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:28,280
a little bit about coming back to the

00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:30,470
progressive web apps story and maybe a

00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,710
little bit about api's and bringing new

00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:36,170
api's to the web is that something that

00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:40,970
we can shift up to a little bit I mean

00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:44,030
one of the one of the interesting things

00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:46,400
that I've seen is that just that we've

00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:48,470
never been in a kind of more active time

00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,180
when it comes to new stuff that's coming

00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:51,650
to the web platform right and I guess

00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:56,380
coming back to what I was saying earlier

00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:56,380
about t pack last a couple weeks ago

00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:03,230
what you know kind of new api's are are

00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:07,370
we looking at or are we excited about

00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:10,430
maybe you know who would like to start

00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:13,760
off weekend G so I think it was a key

00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:16,190
back there's this a key I'm not sure

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:20,080
about the latest name I think it's

00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:24,800
called something like storage boxes or

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,570
storage blocks anyway I think the idea

00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:30,350
is that today when you want to use the

00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:32,570
cache storage for you PWA there is no

00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:34,700
kind of like way for for you as a

00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:37,910
developer to say I'm putting a bunch of

00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:39,680
data here but it's story optional like

00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:42,670
if you run out of storage you can get

00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,450
rid of it but this set is super

00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:46,010
important to get rid of it maybe it's

00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:47,180
better for you to ask me so I can tell

00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:49,550
you though that something is going on

00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:52,820
and the reason I care about this one is

00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:57,140
that when we talk to users in markets

00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:58,490
like India they a lot of users are

00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,770
getting online for the first time and

00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:03,350
they can like afford a very low end

00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:06,410
device and if you look at the spec it's

00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:08,750
like if you're lucky you can get three

00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:11,660
four gigabytes of RAM it's actually

00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,700
pretty cheap the CPU get is like not

00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,470
great

00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:17,559
and then the storage you get is like

00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:21,129
eight Giga obviously you can you can use

00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:22,600
the microSD slot to get more but you end

00:32:21,129 --> 00:32:24,399
up in the situation where people don't

00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,769
have like a laptop and whatnot and so

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:29,230
they are like managing that storage and

00:32:26,769 --> 00:32:30,669
if you think about the pillory where it

00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:33,159
really actually has a great story

00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:35,679
because it can be as small as it needs

00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:39,039
to be except that we don't really know

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:41,590
as a browser what can we get rid of what

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,779
is important to user what is not and so

00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:47,679
this kind of API Archie super exciting

00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:49,720
for this particular use case yeah one of

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,119
the stories you told me I met about the

00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,730
about your first experiences on the

00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:56,619
internet kind of resonate with yeah I

00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:58,389
mean it comes back to a lot of topics we

00:32:56,619 --> 00:32:59,919
talked about already but like I shared

00:32:58,389 --> 00:33:03,850
the story of like my first time getting

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:07,509
online was through when I was little in

00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:09,309
Syria living in Damascus and I had to do

00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:11,289
a long distance dial-up to the country

00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:13,149
next door so I can access the internet

00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:15,070
on a dial-up connection because it was

00:33:13,149 --> 00:33:17,679
illegal for where I was from and at the

00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:19,359
time and I had to do it in the middle of

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,739
the night you know behind closed doors

00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:23,950
because if they arrest you you're gonna

00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:27,309
go to jail so you know dial-up internet

00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:28,989
long distance and hand-me-down laptop

00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:31,509
from my cousins in the US who came to

00:33:28,989 --> 00:33:33,009
visit that's how I got online and even

00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,749
though that's shifted and changed you

00:33:33,009 --> 00:33:36,519
know over the years still the

00:33:34,749 --> 00:33:37,720
limitations of developing countries as

00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:40,600
you said whether it's in devices

00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,369
portable or otherwise are still there

00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,139
whether it's a privacy concern because

00:33:42,369 --> 00:33:45,730
back there it's not about so much the

00:33:44,139 --> 00:33:47,590
browser and what you you know blocked my

00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,639
website it's about your ISP tracking you

00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:50,919
and your government want to know

00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:52,769
everything you're doing or you know

00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:55,809
monetization option as well because

00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:57,489
credit cards are not a thing people do

00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:59,830
money transfers through cell phone and

00:33:57,489 --> 00:34:01,269
SMS communication right so when we talk

00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,259
about these kind of opportunities and

00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:04,600
things that we're developing the web

00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:06,369
platform for we're leaving a big portion

00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,559
of you know humanity and people behind

00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:09,819
but over time they either they're

00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:11,559
they're the ones catching up we're not

00:34:09,819 --> 00:34:13,419
going in and trying to lean in and

00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:15,819
helping you know be where they are and

00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:17,589
to your point whether it's like new AP

00:34:15,819 --> 00:34:19,659
is and the platforms to better detect

00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:22,000
and you know adapt to the environment or

00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:24,580
creating opportunities where where none

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,870
exists right so like

00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,910
performance is a big thing and they a

00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:29,440
thing that I carried with me over the

00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:31,180
years even though now I live in Toronto

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,500
and I have a high-speed Internet is if I

00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:34,600
said the website doesn't load fast

00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,270
enough I'm not using it period because

00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,710
back in the dial-up days I only had the

00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:40,360
minute amount of time before the cops

00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,740
gonna come come on the door so I just

00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,300
needed to get online do the thing I

00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:45,070
needed to do and get out

00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,710
but that's still a pattern of behavior I

00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:48,880
do today and honestly that's a good and

00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,650
better experience for everybody

00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,930
regardless like performance is a key

00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:54,190
differentiator but especially 40s

00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:56,650
developing countries in the world are

00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:59,080
interesting that when Twitter launched

00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:01,300
their Twitter light progressive web app

00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:05,650
and that's I use that exclusively now

00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:09,040
for all Twitter stuff they launched it

00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:10,990
as as Twitter light you know address it

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,180
with with specific features that address

00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:17,020
developing countries and low bandwidth

00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:19,150
needs so yeah maybe something about

00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:21,230
progressive web maps in Firefox as well

00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,410
we're currently building em a new

00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:25,390
[Music]

00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:27,370
Firefox browser for Android it's

00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,140
currently called Firefox preview but

00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:31,390
that's not the final name eventually it

00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:33,970
will replace the the current firefox in

00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:35,860
the indy up store and so we have the

00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:38,080
luxury there to kind of reimplemented

00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:39,700
thing and so we're also rethinking how

00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,230
we implement progressive web apps so

00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,700
we're working on bringing that back to

00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:45,490
the to the browser in the earlier

00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:47,530
versions that are out now it's not it's

00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:49,270
not supported yet but so manifests

00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:52,240
support or installation support and so

00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:54,670
on is coming soon push notifications as

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,890
well so they're landing soon and we're

00:35:54,670 --> 00:36:00,100
looking there again at doing something

00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:01,360
with badging kind of surfacing to the

00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,000
user that something is installable

00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:08,710
without getting too much in their way

00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:11,470
because we see that users do find it

00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:14,230
more comfortable sometimes to or they

00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:15,970
feel more confident that the progressive

00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,470
web app is what they need rather than

00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:19,210
the native app they don't need all the

00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:21,010
the bells and whistles of the of the

00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:23,740
native app they're just fine as you say

00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:26,080
with the the sort of slimmed down

00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:27,610
experience perhaps or kind of the faster

00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,350
experience or the experience where they

00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:32,020
can control the permissions because I

00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:34,710
feel ok the browser has my back and and

00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:37,320
I don't have to give away all my

00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:40,200
you know private data or whatever all

00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:43,110
kinds of permissions and and that native

00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:45,630
apps have and so I can I can better

00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:47,640
control the the experience like the

00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:50,010
browser has my back that could be a good

00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,320
example it's a user agent right so you

00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:54,770
have to act on there you know on the

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,770
user's behalf

00:36:55,370 --> 00:37:02,310
you mentioned notifications which brings

00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:04,170
to mind the topic of permissions we have

00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:05,600
a few more minutes left some do do we

00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:09,450
want to talk about permissions

00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:13,530
notifications I can say something about

00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:15,900
that so we've we've seen that as you've

00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:18,270
all seen actually let me let me go back

00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:21,170
three years ago I was on this stage not

00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:23,040
two not two no no we want to you're

00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:25,140
standing on the stage talking about

00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,570
progressive web apps and then at that

00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,010
time notifications web notifications was

00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:30,390
something new I were saying yeah you

00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:32,550
should try this out because it will

00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:34,770
allow you to reach users and they don't

00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,120
have to subscribe to your to your

00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:38,310
mailing list you can just send them a

00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,930
push notifications and now as we know

00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:42,690
you know when you go on the mobile web

00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:43,920
you're sort of bombarded with requests

00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:45,660
to like please accept our push

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,470
notifications so we're bringing in more

00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:51,300
controls to kind of limit this to allow

00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:53,850
users to turn off requests for push

00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,230
notifications or else to kind of do it

00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,850
in a more subtle way so you don't have

00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:59,970
to deal with a pop-up but you just see

00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:01,890
something happening you know as a soft

00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:03,960
wiggle of an icon or something like that

00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:05,730
sort of say hey this side wants to send

00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:12,630
you push notifications but please

00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:15,660
continue browsing yeah always difficult

00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:18,450
to like inform users but not gonna even

00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:21,390
so I think a lot of designers in our

00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:25,920
team are also like trying to figure out

00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:27,870
what's the best way to do that I think

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,300
that's why I'm user control is like a

00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:31,410
very important tenant because you know

00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,150
every person will have different

00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:35,070
preferences about like when they want to

00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:36,690
be notified how they want to be notified

00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:38,820
and what kind of information they want

00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:40,710
so there's like two main problems which

00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,600
is like permission fatigue like you just

00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:44,369
see these things everywhere and then

00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,720
also the lifetime of

00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:48,869
rushon right you know it's like just

00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:50,849
because I am fine with you having this

00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:52,140
permission now while I'm like trying to

00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:53,880
get this very specific thing done

00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,900
doesn't mean I'm okay with you having it

00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,640
like two weeks from now

00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,749
so those are two like very important

00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,980
things that we're you know trying to

00:38:57,749 --> 00:39:02,490
think through you know we're thinking

00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:05,249
like can we extend the api's to kind of

00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:07,049
have the user control you know time

00:39:05,249 --> 00:39:08,670
limits for these permissions like okay

00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:10,589
you can have this for an hour so I can

00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:11,999
just get in and out of this experience

00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:13,529
or you can have it for a week because I

00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:15,359
come here every day or something like

00:39:13,529 --> 00:39:18,210
that so I think that'll be interesting

00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:19,920
and I like the idea of actually you know

00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:22,589
kind of pairing back the UI a little bit

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,869
in certain cases because it's still

00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:26,579
there these are you know can know that

00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:28,289
they have you know something going on

00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:31,700
but it's not like right in their face so

00:39:28,289 --> 00:39:31,700
I think that's a really cool experiment

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,400
at some point we we are like hoping by

00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:41,039
having this like UX more in your face

00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,079
like a model dialog like developer

00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:46,680
wouldn't do it but actually to keep

00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:48,900
doing it and so I think there is some

00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:52,650
some incentive problem on the web where

00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:55,950
you can get away with like annoying user

00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:58,460
experience like there is no saying like

00:39:55,950 --> 00:40:00,269
user would just keep coming back because

00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,859
maybe they would like search for

00:40:00,269 --> 00:40:03,720
something and you get on search page and

00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:06,599
they forget about the budget expense

00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:08,210
they got last time and I think there is

00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,170
a set of things we could do better here

00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:11,940
trying to incent you guys they are

00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:13,829
developers we really care about it and

00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,660
like only prompt when it's needed I

00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:17,489
think we should reward - its kind of

00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:22,380
user experience and find ways to to get

00:40:17,489 --> 00:40:26,430
more of those on the web I think by

00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:28,140
default limiting the sort of making sure

00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:31,349
the user doesn't give away too much as

00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:32,880
you say like a you know an expiry after

00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:36,150
a certain time or just default to like

00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,220
once but not always and make them do

00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:40,769
more effort to say allow permissions

00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:42,569
permant allow notifications to come

00:40:40,769 --> 00:40:45,720
through permanently or something like

00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:48,630
this is you know also we've seen a lot

00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:51,809
of examples of websites malicious

00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:55,380
websites a gaming the user experience or

00:40:51,809 --> 00:40:57,369
socially manipulating the user was the

00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,430
one that I saw recently where some

00:40:57,369 --> 00:41:02,529
there was a graphic of some friendly

00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:04,089
looking you know cartoon character

00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:06,009
pointing up towards the notification

00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:10,650
prompt saying prove you're not a robot

00:41:06,009 --> 00:41:13,059
by clicking ok right this diabolical

00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:15,160
absolutely diabolical manipulation of

00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:17,170
the user because users are used to like

00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,670
prove you're not a robot things you know

00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:21,430
they just they don't see them anymore so

00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:23,170
it's something I think we need to pay

00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:26,339
attention to you in the last three

00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:29,440
minutes maybe we want to kind of like

00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:31,239
what's the go down the road you know

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,219
like what's what's the what's the I

00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:34,869
don't know what do you want to fix on

00:41:33,219 --> 00:41:38,140
the web what's the what's the web view

00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:44,259
web we want kind of a you know a closing

00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:46,420
statement doesn't need to be everything

00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:49,690
this is one thing you know you know so I

00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:51,640
think I feel very lucky to have been

00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:53,349
able to work on the intersection of like

00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,059
technology and human rights on the web

00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:57,430
you know it's like accessibility privacy

00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:59,469
these are like fundamental things that

00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:03,339
we should all enjoy and not have to give

00:41:59,469 --> 00:42:05,499
up and so you know as we kind of head

00:42:03,339 --> 00:42:07,359
into thinking more about like how can we

00:42:05,499 --> 00:42:09,640
preserve privacy on the web I think like

00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,710
one really interesting question is like

00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,539
what do we do about fingerprinting you

00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:15,130
know so there's all these api's that

00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:17,529
allow us to do like really cool stuff on

00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:18,160
the web but they also allow you to kind

00:42:17,529 --> 00:42:20,440
of covertly

00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,059
you know create a profile of a person

00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,829
and track them without them knowing you

00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:27,099
know so they're blocking cookies or

00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:29,259
something so I think like figuring out

00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:31,239
that is gonna be very interesting and

00:42:29,259 --> 00:42:33,160
I'm looking forward to openly

00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:36,549
collaborating on standards with the rest

00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:38,799
of the folks so thank you for me it's

00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:40,420
mostly about Fiat like the discovery

00:42:38,799 --> 00:42:42,489
issue that people have been mentioning I

00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,829
think that there is a lot of opportunity

00:42:42,489 --> 00:42:46,690
for us to reward great user experience

00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:49,719
finding ways to get users to discover

00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:52,210
what is good about the web so more work

00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:54,789
on that especially trying to close the

00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:56,890
gap that we have I feel between what

00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:58,749
sort of excuse expense you can get from

00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:00,729
a native app an interval like

00:42:58,749 --> 00:43:02,140
discovering and what you get on the web

00:43:00,729 --> 00:43:04,450
today where it's still a little like

00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:06,160
hard work and you can feel that it's

00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:07,640
still very much like your page driven

00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,580
user and Experian

00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:12,590
you can see single loading and Weber's

00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:15,470
dislike press of content and if we could

00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:17,900
make discovery like seamless great user

00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:19,130
experience and - and people would come

00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,350
to realize what the web has to offer

00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:24,680
over the native and world government

00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:27,050
that people use today so I'm gonna be

00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:29,810
slightly selfish and say let's let's fix

00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:33,290
monetization on the web or have a go at

00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:36,890
it like many people have tried many

00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:38,720
times before you know we have this

00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:41,060
opportunity now you're all content

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,410
creators out there so I'd encourage you

00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:44,630
to go check out the web monetization

00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:47,210
work it's a simple meta tag that you can

00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:50,000
insert into your URLs it is literally

00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:51,670
one line we have this thing to

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,020
incentivize you call grant for the web

00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:56,690
it's a hundred billion dollars it's not

00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:58,400
it's pocket change compared to what the

00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:00,650
Amazons and the Netflix's of the world

00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:04,700
spend on their content ecosystem but

00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:07,280
it's a starting point to catalyze the

00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:09,410
web monetize web and content that can be

00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,480
web monetize on the web so go out and do

00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:16,340
it and I think it's gonna be interesting

00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:18,760
times my one thing I want to see for the

00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:22,310
web is a more inclusive web for all

00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:23,360
developers all around the world that you

00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:25,880
know I think we're missing a lot of

00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:28,070
experiences that we are definitely aware

00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,540
of but are not being represented in

00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:30,320
these kind of conversations and these

00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,660
kind of dialogues

00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,910
well there's standards or api's or you

00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:36,170
know better behaviors so I'd like I'd

00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:37,490
like us to see you reach out and that

00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:40,640
doesn't have doesn't always mean you

00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:42,530
know other side of the world there's a

00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,060
lot of underrepresented points of view

00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:45,620
and our interactions from developers

00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:47,810
communities who are part of big

00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:49,370
enterprise businesses or you know folks

00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:51,680
who don't go out to conferences or not

00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:53,240
part of a certain community I think I

00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,920
want to see more of that representation

00:44:53,240 --> 00:45:00,380
and learn from it as much as share back

00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:02,540
to them yes from my side I think right

00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:05,300
now when you browse the mobile web you

00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:07,370
see a lot of broken things they don't

00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:09,950
look visually very pleasing there's too

00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:13,100
many pop-ups too many prompts I want to

00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:15,860
see that fixed while also still you know

00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:17,859
the whole privacy aspect preserving some

00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:20,490
way to

00:45:17,859 --> 00:45:22,930
you know ties into monetization as well

00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:25,470
providing some privacy or providing some

00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:29,589
privacy preserving way of making money

00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:36,339
and making it all visually pleasing that

00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:38,740
is sort of my you know my goal well as

00:45:36,339 --> 00:45:41,380
concei mentioned there are some people

00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:44,200
that only have well ups as their options

00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:47,369
so I am looking forward to making web

00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:51,130
apps more usable like native apps and

00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:53,260
also Melanie's talked before this panel

00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:57,190
was very interesting because as a

00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:59,740
browser developer it's sometimes

00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:01,599
difficult to balance between the users

00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:04,000
needs and the content developer is

00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:06,849
intense so like we also have a high

00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,970
contrast mode built in our engine but it

00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:14,290
sometimes breaks websites so making

00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:18,970
these standards is really what we should

00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:21,010
work together on in the future great way

00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:23,319
to close out thank you very much

00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:26,530
everybody okay and we're all keen to get

00:46:23,319 --> 00:46:28,599
to lunch it were two minutes over so I

00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:34,740
really want to ask you all to thank our

00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:34,740
members of the panel today and thank you

00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,160
