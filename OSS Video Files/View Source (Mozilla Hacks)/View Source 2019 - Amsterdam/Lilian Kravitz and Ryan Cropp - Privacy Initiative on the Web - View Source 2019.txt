	#lilliankravitz #ryancropp #privacy #viewsourceconf
As creators of the web we have a responsibility to protect users privacy. This talk will discuss forming privacy principles and how listening to customers helps us know what problems to solve. We will dive into user research and how that drives changes to online privacy. We will explore the challenges of providing users with the balanced level of transparency, control and education about their online privacy. Lastly, we will look forward towards the future of privacy.

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,580
talks have been amazing right I think so

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:12,750
I think it makes us all really

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,910
appreciative to be a part of this

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,400
community and just like go back to work

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,720
started okay my name is Luanne Kravitz

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,390
later in this talk you're gonna hear

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,640
from my colleague Ryan crop we are both

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,869
work on Microsoft edge and we

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,460
specifically work on our privacy

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,439
features and we're really excited this

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,090
seems to be a huge theme going forward

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:39,000
and and so I'm gonna definitely talk

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:40,950
about okay that's good this clicker so

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,320
today we're gonna talk about a fresh

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,559
perspective set of challenges that we

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,739
are facing today as browsers we are

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,870
going to touch upon customer research

00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:54,120
privacy principles our new privacy

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,460
feature as well as a little bit about

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,960
the technical implementation and then

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:03,660
we'll talk about the future of online

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:07,020
privacy in the past we used to put

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:10,280
Microsoft at the center we were solving

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,689
problems with Microsoft atop of minds

00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,700
but now we're solving problems through a

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:17,909
different lens we're putting the

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,750
customer in the center we've learned

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:24,180
that we do not know all of the answers

00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:26,340
running comes to the web we also know

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:30,200
that we are not solely responsible for

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:33,079
the web developers and search engines

00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,450
government's advertisers and publishers

00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:40,020
surfers of the web and browsers together

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:45,000
we create the web together we create a

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:47,220
massive industry and economy we learn

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,009
from our customers that our previous

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,340
browser was not meeting their needs from

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,380
a web compatibility perspective it was

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,219
also affecting web developers ability to

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:03,420
test on so many different platforms so

00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:04,829
by putting the customer in the center we

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,580
learned that we need to realign our

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:11,910
priorities we made a new browser based

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,990
off of chromium put in the customer

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,450
center also

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,770
versus us to look at the browser and

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:21,750
look at the web from a different

00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:23,820
perspective well listen to customers and

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:27,150
their modern technology problems a

00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:32,270
signal we heard loud and clear is that

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,270
privacy is a huge issue on the Internet

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:38,760
we began as a team to look at the

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,300
privacy space as researchers and

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,190
learners not experts we went out to

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:49,110
learn from customers about what privacy

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:50,640
looks and feels like today in 2019 there

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,890
are a lot of proposals to improve

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,580
privacy

00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:56,730
there's proposals to improve

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,150
do-not-track change standards limit

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,950
fingerprinting and rethink identity and

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,750
from a technical perspective there's a

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,820
lot to keep track of in terms of

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,030
regulations on data collection and data

00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:11,670
use if you think it's complicated in an

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,290
audience full of web developers just

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,120
imagine what it's like for everyone

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:19,170
simply trying to go online and get

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,030
things done so if you're going on the

00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,510
internet and you're just trying to plan

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:27,180
a weekend trip privacy isn't necessarily

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:30,150
the top of mind but hacks and data

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:33,120
breaches compromised passwords and GDP

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:37,380
our cookie banners are scary for even

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:40,020
the technically inclined before we get

00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,000
started too far into it it's important

00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,430
to note that we've all learned from each

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,040
other in the tech industry when it comes

00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,230
to online privacy no one is necessarily

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,110
right or wrong everyone is just on their

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,130
own journey when it comes to privacy and

00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:55,560
we're starting our journey from scratch

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,230
and that's what we did and it's our

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,060
story over the past year we hope you can

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,310
take something from it and apply it to

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,690
your day-to-day and because we're still

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,340
learning we would more than appreciate

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:11,459
continuing the conversation with all of

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:13,740
you afterwards the web community is a

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:16,109
diverse and dynamic set of customers

00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:19,500
ranging from everyday cat video watchers

00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:22,020
avid video gamers web developers and

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,360
business entrepreneurs we think it's

00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:28,169
important that all voices are heard

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,759
to build the best web for everyone we

00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:32,189
started this journey building a new

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:37,409
browser by asking users a simple

00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:40,050
question if you could change one thing

00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:41,729
about the web what would it be and I

00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,969
heard this conversation happening at

00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:46,919
this conference as well and so we asked

00:04:43,969 --> 00:04:49,590
our users but we got about 5,000

00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:52,919
responses and the number one response

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:55,740
wasn't super interesting it is speeding

00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:57,780
performance users still want a faster

00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,780
and more performant browsing experience

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:04,440
not surprising so we should spend all of

00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:06,389
our time on this right the second

00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,940
largest piece of feedback it was privacy

00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:11,639
and Trust users are saying that they

00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,940
want privacy on the web they want trust

00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:17,310
with their browser but still being in

00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:20,250
performance was the number one ask from

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,740
users now the very largest piece of

00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:26,340
feedback that's where things got more

00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:28,680
interesting it was advertisements also

00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,810
not super surprising users are asking

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,300
for less ads on the web I think we've

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,370
all heard this but when you look through

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,680
the comments and read all of them you

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,960
see that users are specifically asking

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,729
for ads that don't track them they're

00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,449
saying things like I want less creepy

00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:48,120
ads so therefore if you put together the

00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:49,860
privacy and feedback items with the

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,169
users that are asking for ads that don't

00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,000
track them it becomes the number one

00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:57,389
thing that users are asking for to

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,490
change about the web so users are

00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:01,319
telling us that they want privacy

00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,930
they're saying I want trust with a

00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,520
browser and in their words I think the

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,969
number one response was users literally

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,000
just saying more privacy this really

00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:15,900
calls us to realign and focus on what

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,289
users are telling us so after learning

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,240
that privacy is top of mind we went out

00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:26,009
and interviewed customers about how they

00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:28,229
manage their online privacy we heard

00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:30,569
from users that they think most about

00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:34,770
their online privacy when creating a new

00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:35,240
account reading about news about privacy

00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,389
and

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:42,590
 and breaches purchasing something

00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:46,880
on the internet or seeing ads based on

00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:49,340
their previous browsing and we heard

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,470
from users that they try and help this

00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,819
they try and fix their privacy they go

00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,080
into the settings but they get lost

00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:56,690
because there's too many and they're

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,370
confusing they download an extension

00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:01,090
because a friend told them to but they

00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:04,220
don't know if it's actually working or

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:06,199
they do nothing because users tell us

00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:10,009
that they feel helpless at this time of

00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:12,259
technology and online privacy so after

00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:14,539
listening to dozens of users modern

00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:16,250
privacy problems our team start to

00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:19,099
quickly brainstorm and figure out how to

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,690
solve these problems technically we

00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:23,599
quickly realized that we were doing

00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:26,960
things out of order we had to stop and

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:29,060
take a step back and create a set of

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,970
privacy principles that our team can

00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:36,889
stand by we are calling our privacy

00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:38,630
principles our Hippocratic oath doctors

00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:41,570
taken Hippocratic oath to behold

00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:44,090
standards for their patients so we

00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:47,380
developed a Hippocratic oath that we as

00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:51,110
developers can behold for our users

00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:53,630
we've responsibility I mean all of us in

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,570
this room have a responsibility as

00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:58,610
creators of the web

00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:03,199
it took us time to develop exactly what

00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:06,710
our responsibility is this is not a

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:10,400
simple technical problem there is no

00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:12,770
clear answer to privacy and we need to

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,530
be cognizant of the fact that online

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:18,490
privacy affects developers publishers

00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,840
and advertisers as well as browsers and

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:27,800
it also affects users and their

00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:30,139
experience that they have on the web the

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,639
laws have not fully caught up to the

00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:34,490
degree of power that we have as

00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:37,310
developers we therefore need to

00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:39,260
self-regulate and at the end of the day

00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:44,120
we need to do what is right for our

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:46,550
users around the world we developed four

00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,690
principles that we as a team can truly

00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,870
stand by

00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:54,320
and their control transparency respect

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:57,140
and protection control we will put you

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,330
in control of your data and whether you

00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:03,470
want us to delete that data or use it to

00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:06,640
improve your experiences transparency we

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:12,380
will inform you when where and whom is

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:15,830
collecting data respect we will always

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:18,460
respect you and your choice and if you

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:21,350
do not want to select any information

00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:23,510
protection we will protect your personal

00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:26,000
information and prevent unauthorized

00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:31,490
access to it and never share it unless

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,770
we inform you so now with our new

00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:36,290
privacy principles and learnings from

00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,110
users we went back to brainstorming how

00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,340
we can solve the problems that we heard

00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,640
from the numerous customer interviews

00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:45,560
surveys group creation sessions we had

00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:50,030
identified a top problem that customers

00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:52,910
were facing users told us one of their

00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:55,010
biggest concerns was to stop sights on

00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:59,150
associated with their browsing from

00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:01,630
collecting data about them we drove into

00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:05,030
this morning what exactly does this mean

00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:06,380
and what we heard was I'm browsing for

00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:08,530
something on the Internet

00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:11,060
and then I seen ad for it immediately

00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,780
I'm uncertain who is collecting data

00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,050
about me

00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:17,780
I feel creeped out by the ads that are

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:23,180
following me I don't want my browsing

00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:24,950
being chart Selena mentioned this

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,230
earlier and it's quite interesting so

00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:29,120
one of the most common stories that we

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,010
heard in our interviews over and over

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,410
again when just asking users about

00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:35,810
technology and privacy when something

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,430
like this my husband and I were having a

00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:40,730
conversation and we just talked about

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:44,180
diapers and then I got ads for an

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,950
immediately and it feels creepy we heard

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,140
this type of story over and over again

00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,690
and people are telling us like it's just

00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,610
happening to them and no one else it's

00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,920
really indicating that there's an issue

00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:58,670
across multiple devices technology and

00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,830
apps but along with this there's another

00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,470
signal that we heard and it was very

00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:04,430
loud

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:11,330
it's different from what we heard

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:14,410
previously it's that I like personalized

00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:17,360
ads I discover new products due to ads

00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:20,830
they remind me to purchase things it

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,830
makes the internet more personal to me

00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:29,300
so we have this clear signal from users

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,060
saying that they hate being tracked but

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,080
then from the same second with customers

00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,780
they tell us that they find the

00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,340
personalized content useful so how can

00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,830
we solve a problem that is both a

00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:43,340
privacy concern but then also a useful

00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:45,110
feature of browsing we use the specific

00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,690
signals that we heard from our customers

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:50,200
our new privacy principles to develop

00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:53,720
our own version of tracking prevention

00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,850
an l ryan is going to continue to talk

00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:08,840
about putting our solution into the

00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:11,060
browser thank you so as we've discussed

00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,910
we've heard a wide range of interest

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,740
from our users about about privacy and

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,360
we got the feeling that there wouldn't

00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,340
be one solution for privacy that would

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,320
fit everyone but probably a balanced

00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:24,890
approach with options could be the way

00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,780
forward so given our privacy principles

00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:28,370
let's look at tracking prevention as one

00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,470
of the first outputs of our research and

00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,470
an example of how we can build privacy

00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,490
respecting user experiences for everyone

00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,780
so there were a lot of ways that we

00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:38,450
could have gone about creating a

00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,610
solution for tracking prevention should

00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:42,380
we just give people one privacy toggle

00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,960
that enables every tracking prevention

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,790
imaginable like enabling a VPN blocking

00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,040
third-party cookie access

00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,930
resource loads ads and randomizing

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,660
browsing data and then just saying

00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:56,990
you're protected well it's certainly

00:12:53,660 --> 00:13:00,140
possible there are problems with one

00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:01,940
switch there's little control on and off

00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,590
doesn't give the granularity that people

00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,140
have asked us for and it wouldn't be

00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:07,400
respectful of their individual needs

00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,990
there's also an or transparency on

00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,640
what's happening behind the scenes to

00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:13,450
help people get a better understanding

00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,740
with what's happening on the web

00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,750
so instead of one solution for all

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:19,120
problems we decided that we were just

00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,530
going to start small and build one

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,400
solution for tracking rich and inside

00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:26,680
the browser so we know that online

00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,210
trackers are storing and collecting a

00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,000
lot of data about users as they browse

00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,650
the web users are seeing the effects of

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,300
this tracking if your personalized ads

00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,770
but are we seeing the full picture

00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,150
because a lot of times the data is

00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:40,750
collected without their knowledge behind

00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,890
the scenes and tracking prevention is

00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,020
not a new feature in the browser

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:45,640
ecosystem other browser vendors and

00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,020
extensions already restrict online

00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,720
trackers into certain sites in various

00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,950
ways but because we aren't the first

00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,930
year were able to learn from our

00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,180
community of developers browsers and

00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,590
users to take a new look at how we could

00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:00,070
build tracking prevention that adheres

00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:02,800
to our privacy principles so from our

00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:04,420
research we knew this that there was one

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,130
group of people who just want maximum

00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,980
privacy but we can't just block

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,910
everything because that breaks the web

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,800
monetization for publishers can't be

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,620
upheld and experiences like sign-in and

00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,000
social sharing stop working but there's

00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,430
a segment of people who want this level

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,500
of protection a second group of people

00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:23,020
like seeing personalized ads but don't

00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,460
mind being tracked so much but we can

00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,620
also do nothing because malicious

00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,540
tracking and data misuse is causing

00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:30,880
problems but yet again there are people

00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:34,330
who enjoy personalized experiences over

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:43,240
generic content and ads and then the

00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:45,550
last group we heard from which was and

00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,320
then the third largest the last group we

00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,480
heard from thought it would be great if

00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,730
I didn't see so many creepy ads been

00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,250
added they like me the way I like the

00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,970
way the web as it is but they would like

00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,940
to know more about what's happening

00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:59,650
behind the scenes so overall people give

00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,540
us a very different feedback but we had

00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:03,340
to design a solution that fits everyone

00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:06,490
which is why we landed on giving people

00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,900
options and not a single checkbox so

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,280
fresh tracking prevention was designed

00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,530
with the principle that defaults matter

00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,210
will respect your privacy and most

00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:14,980
people most people will not even have to

00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,930
know that the setting exists or change

00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,250
at all this is because our

00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,760
implementation of tracking prevention

00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:23,759
protects you by default with blocking in

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:27,069
the background to

00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:31,810
automatically keep your privacy

00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:32,949
protected and so we set out with the

00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,870
three different options to create

00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:37,180
tracking prevention and what we have

00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:40,209
here is three different options that

00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,529
give the user control with the middle

00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:42,939
selection where most people will fall

00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:46,059
and choices on both sides of the

00:15:42,939 --> 00:15:47,709
spectrum we have three levels of basic

00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:50,259
tracking prevention which are basic

00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:52,180
balanced and strict so basic is for the

00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:54,879
person who wants the web to be

00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:56,230
personalized to them balances for most

00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,199
people who want the web to work as it

00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:00,819
does now but with less creepiness and

00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:02,589
strict is for the people who want more

00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:04,870
privacy at the cost of some web

00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:05,860
compatibility so to understand how much

00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,459
attending works I'll give a brief

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:11,079
overview of trackers and our first

00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:13,180
implementation we use an open source

00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:14,589
list of known tracking domains we're

00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,269
working with others to ensure that the

00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:17,800
source of the list is agnostic across

00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:19,029
companies and we don't give any special

00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,879
treatment to an entity including

00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:23,589
ourselves we're also helping to update

00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:26,559
the tracker categorization to improve

00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:27,970
web compatibility for all consumers and

00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,259
I'll know there are various types of

00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:35,949
trackers that are restricted differently

00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:38,019
depending on each setting more malicious

00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:39,610
trackers that fingerprint your device or

00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:41,199
users or devices resources to mine

00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,620
cryptocurrency are blocked across all

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,939
levels

00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,279
no one should want these types of

00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:46,360
trackers in their browser there are

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,680
other types of trackers which can

00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,420
provide value to the web such as

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,740
advertising social media and analytic

00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,199
trackers that show up consistently

00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:55,059
across sites but because these trackers

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,680
are more nuanced in the way that people

00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:57,970
prefer their web experience they

00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:04,870
restricted differently across each

00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:07,949
setting in basic we block the most

00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:10,030
malicious trackers and allow all others

00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:11,919
unbalanced which is the default setting

00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,539
will block storage access and for

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,100
advertising and social media trackers

00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:16,449
which means that people will still see

00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,610
ads but they won't have the creepiness

00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:23,620
of ads and diapers following them around

00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:26,500
the internet and in strict we block

00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:28,179
resource and storage access from

00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,520
advertising analytics and social media

00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:32,780
trackers and as many ad resources are

00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,430
also capable of tracking this

00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:38,570
a fact of possibly blocking some

00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:40,430
advertisers as well and for developers

00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:43,070
who want to see the effects of how all

00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:44,540
of these enforcement's play out you can

00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,210
check out the developer tools console

00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,920
where we list blocked resources and

00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,300
storage access and also include the

00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,980
various different types of requests

00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,140
whether it's from a script iframe or

00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,210
image and to reiterate we want the

00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,340
default experience to have no impact on

00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,990
web compatibility so if you're using a

00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,280
new edge browser and your site or

00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:03,170
another that you come across isn't

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,600
working correctly please send us a smile

00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:08,000
or a frown to let us know what's going

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,290
on your experience developing forehead

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,810
should be great for you and your users

00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:13,460
so as we gather more feedback we're

00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:15,350
continuing to update how attracting

00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,270
prevention works in the background as we

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:21,980
strive to increase web compatibility and

00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:23,870
increase privacy so after creating our

00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,580
first version of tracking prevention we

00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,590
took a step back and look back at our

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,880
principles from my Hippocratic oath to

00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:32,390
make sure that we lived up to our

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,850
standards we gave four three options

00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,170
which puts the user in control we have a

00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,550
block trackers view that provides

00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,710
transparency into what tracking

00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,120
prevention is blocking and we're

00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,580
respecting the user's choice and

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,960
protecting them by default so tracking

00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,430
prevention really only intends to solve

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,380
one problem that we learned from our

00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:50,270
users and there are many more privacy

00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,640
problems out there that we can go right

00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:54,230
for new solutions and our team is

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,520
excited to keep learning from customers

00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,550
and to keep helping you move the web

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,550
forward

00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:02,300
Ameno microsoft recently participated in

00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,920
the first web privacy workshop where

00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,410
browser vendors met to discuss the tough

00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,060
topic of privacy the two day discussion

00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:10,100
was a big step to come together as a

00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,930
group and to build mutual understanding

00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,130
and find a common ground so that we can

00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:16,040
collaborate in the open to preserve

00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,240
privacy on the web funding plan was

00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,740
allocated to discuss some tough

00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,600
questions such as the need to work

00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,750
together to find shared solutions for

00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:26,240
publishers government's monetization and

00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,980
privacy this was an incredible effort

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,700
towards alignment and collaboration for

00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,700
the future of the web

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,840
in those thoughts all browser vendors

00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,580
shared proposals for improving privacy

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,770
online including policies and

00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:44,850
protections from Safari brave Firefox

00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:46,500
Chrome Samsung amore we proposed the

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,270
tracker auditing program as a means of

00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,130
identifying trackers that are meeting

00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:53,250
privacy standards of transparency

00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:54,900
control and respect this could help

00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,580
preserve the economic business of

00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:00,200
advertising while giving users the

00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,200
respect and privacy that they deserve

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,780
one of the biggest outcomes of this

00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,550
privacy workshop was the initial

00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,980
planning for the creation of a privacy

00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,630
community group within the w3c and

00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,820
discussions began at TPAC just two weeks

00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:14,010
ago a separate will allow all

00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,300
participants to create on a collaborate

00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,700
on a vision for the future of the

00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,350
privacy for privacy on the web and

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,670
overall this is a can new and continuing

00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,410
effort and it's awesome to see everyone

00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,820
here discussing privacy as well and

00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:27,090
we're really looking forward to more

00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:29,160
progress on this in the future so what

00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:30,570
does the future of privacy look like is

00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,880
it just that there will be no privacy

00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,380
such that a segment of users are okay

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,900
with giving up their privacy or in turn

00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,640
for free services well you have to pay

00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,990
for privacy such as your privacy is only

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,660
protected if you're willing to pay for

00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:45,180
it will you be paid for your data such

00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:48,720
that you are paid for letting your data

00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:51,980
be collected or we have to specify what

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,270
data is being collected about you

00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,980
overall there's a lot of tough questions

00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,050
we have to go out and solve and it's

00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,110
ripe for solutions that we are

00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:05,100
continuing to look for and excited to

00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:07,590
keep exploring so when we went out and

00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,240
asked our customers if you could have a

00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:11,120
magic wand and change one thing about

00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,740
privacy online what would it be

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,080
we heard privacy at the click of a

00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,690
button or three levels of privacy online

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,880
like low medium and high or regulations

00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:22,200
on how companies are using their data or

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,990
even transparency on the type of data

00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,300
that's collected these are genuine and

00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:29,370
basic asks users are only asking for

00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,920
anything complicated or revolutionary

00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:33,690
there's just basic needs what they're

00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,820
asking for is transparency on what's

00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:38,460
being collected how to control and

00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,870
manage their data and so maybe it's just

00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,700
the time for us to be respectful and

00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:44,549
honest with users and to simply protect

00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,739
them that's where we

00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:48,359
with our privacy journey obviously is a

00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:49,649
forever changing landscape full of

00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:51,269
problems that we need to go out and

00:21:49,649 --> 00:21:53,249
solve through technical solutions

00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:55,440
regulations web standards and best

00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:57,450
practices the problems that exist today

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,099
won't necessarily exist in five years

00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:02,729
meaning if there will always be new

00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:04,799
privacy problems to explore it's our

00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:06,269
shared responsibility as browser vendors

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,940
and developers to keep asking questions

00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:11,940
keep users privacy as a top priority and

00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:14,369
to keep listening we must continue the

00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,839
loop of researching identifying problems

00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:17,879
solving those problems and then

00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,859
iterating again because privacy is a

00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:22,859
humbling space or there's not always a

00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:26,119
straight answer it requires a balance

00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:26,119
with our customers the top of mine

00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:31,079
so as you can probably tell we are super

00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:33,209
interested in learning from customers

00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:34,559
and that includes developers we'd like

00:22:33,209 --> 00:22:36,029
to continue the conversation with all of

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,009
you about the privacy problems that

00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:39,479
you'd face and if you'd like to reach

00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:40,889
out to us we're available on social

00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:41,639
media you can come talk with us after

00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:44,249
we've already had some great

00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:46,229
conversations of you so thanks to Larry

00:22:44,249 --> 00:22:47,489
and the Microsoft edge team and everyone

00:22:46,229 --> 00:22:50,970
who helped create this mission to

00:22:47,489 --> 00:22:56,930
advance privacy on the web thank you

00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:56,930
