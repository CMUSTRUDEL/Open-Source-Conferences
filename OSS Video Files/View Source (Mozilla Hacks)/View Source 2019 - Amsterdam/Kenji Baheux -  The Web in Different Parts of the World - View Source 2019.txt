Description: 
	#kenjibaheux 
This talk will provide insights about markets that tend to be not well-understood such as India or Indonesia. The goal is to provide an overview of what makes these markets interesting but challenging, e.g. data about the device landscape, state of the web and native apps, connectivity challenges and evolution, opportunities. Parallels will be drawn to more familiar markets to show that efforts motivated by these markets can also benefit other markets.

all right

00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,420
there are like two names on the slide

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,969
and it's because you are who is not here

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,980
actually helped me a lot to create a

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,320
slide especially the Indonesian part and

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,070
so I just wanted to acknowledge his help

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,189
on this presentation so I'm Kenji buyer

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,220
I'm a fried manager I work on Chrome was

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,920
he on making things lot faster or really

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,679
as it's being said and so I want to talk

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,840
to you about how the web looks like in

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,040
different like countries I'm not going

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,010
to talk about the whole world because

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,719
that won't fit into 30 minutes but I'm

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,360
just going to focus on Olivie countries

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,399
but before I do I want to share a little

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,610
bit of background about myself

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,530
and so as you may have noticed I

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:53,000
actually have a Japanese name and maybe

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,379
as you can tell I have a French accent

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,030
it's just because my father likes a lot

00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,670
Japan and so I decided to pick a

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,609
Japanese name because his plan was if I

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,019
named my son with a Japanese name he's

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:05,909
probably going to pick an interest in

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,640
the country and make his life in Japan

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,640
so I can come more often to this country

00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:18,659
because I went to Japan the first time

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,299
in Iran like 2000 I did a bunch of like

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,189
university research and then I

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,860
eventually joined sharp electronics and

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,380
so I was in the midst of this like a

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,790
very interesting time in Japan where it

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,090
was like a lot of innovation about

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,520
future form very fancy things like I'm

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,110
owed as I said yesterday like pushing

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,079
the meat of what you can do on a very

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,540
low spec device and I just keep on and

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,729
on and on and you can see at the top

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,799
there is like some kind of like

00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:49,290
SmartWatch and so I feel that I've seen

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,200
a future in some sense it was a bit

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,090
geeky and whatever but there's this

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,939
famous quote that Steve Jobs actually

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,549
use which is pikas who said that good

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,229
artists copy and great artists steal

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,759
which is you look at something what is

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:02,939
happening as well and you make it your

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,189
own

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,229
you refine your ID and I think this is

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,569
what happening eventually around the

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:10,679
world a lot of the innovation that you

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:12,329
see here

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,329
I think that we are still experiencing

00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:18,900
today in like we find better ways and so

00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:20,879
my hope is that by having you look at

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,769
what's happening around the world you

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,019
might pick up on some interesting like

00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:27,389
Novation that you would never think

00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:31,260
about in other ways and so we feel that

00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:33,780
goes so the plan is to talk about mostly

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:39,030
three countries India Indonesia and

00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:40,530
Japan and in minutes and so that's going

00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,900
to be very tough and so it's very going

00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,900
to be very wide and shallow and

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,090
hopefully that helps you like pick you

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,620
some interest on the topic and like want

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,810
to explore more and maybe talk with me

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,189
afterwards all right

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,950
let's talk about the different

00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:56,760
opportunities that we have so this is

00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,349
Indonesia

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,900
a lot of people as you can see on the

00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:03,629
picture in terms of like people who have

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,359
access to Internet what I did is I

00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:07,859
looked at the number of suits fibre

00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:10,530
broadband subscriber around to things

00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:12,500
like fixed connection at home activity

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,340
and mobile connection

00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,669
so if first thing you will notice is

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,709
that this market is very much a mobile

00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:21,659
market a lot of users just keep the

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:25,069
whole fixed connection and just go from

00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:28,349
a mobile device and mobile connection

00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:29,430
it's only 32 percent penetration in term

00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:31,530
of like number of Internet users

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,510
compared to the population but it's

00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,310
already number seven in terms of like

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:38,430
number of users who have access to in

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:41,549
Internet and population wise it's the

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,989
force like like most populated country

00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:44,790
in the world so there's a lot of

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,959
potential for growth and so it's going

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,109
to be very interesting how that goes

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:53,579
it's a range resting market this is

00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:55,620
Japan and this is quite different

00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:57,479
because Japan has been like connected

00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,759
for a long time and they have a lot of

00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:02,549
these users are using laptops and and

00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:05,639
things like that in terms of penetration

00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:07,259
it's very high it's 91 percent it's the

00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,030
number of five countries in terms of

00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:12,209
number of people who have access to it

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,099
in that and we're a population it's only

00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:16,049
11 and it's going to decline as rate as

00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,060
you know but it's still a very

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:19,829
interesting market a driven like trying

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,480
to drive innovation and things like that

00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:25,830
and find

00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,960
in general so this one is similar to

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,690
Indonesia in the sense that it is very

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,480
much a mobile market half a billion

00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:36,000
users using the internet through their

00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,800
mobile device in fact they just keep the

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,020
whole like buying a laptop is not

00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,110
something that people do they would like

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:47,460
prefer to buy a mobile device and we see

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:49,080
why that is the case it's also still

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,290
like very much like just the beginning

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,970
it's only 34% of penetration it's

00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,820
already another two internal number of

00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:58,800
users after China and population wise

00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:02,910
it's the number one number two country

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,670
right so a very interesting market all

00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,500
right so we do have a lot of users how

00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:10,200
about like their ability to access

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,310
Internet and first and foremost like the

00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,640
more the quality of the mobile

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,950
connection and so it's kind of like

00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:22,800
asking ourselves is the mobile

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:26,010
connection gangster or not so this is

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,130
the cost of data in 2016 for different

00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:31,530
countries so it doesn't really tell you

00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,690
much like is it expensive or not as how

00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,730
does that compare to what people are

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:39,030
familiar with and so one thing you can

00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:42,000
do is look in term of like power

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,590
approaches parity and so it's this idea

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,410
of like trying to find okay what's the

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:48,180
value of this particular currency in a

00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:51,030
different country and so that gives you

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,520
an idea of like how expensive that is

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,320
the thing it doesn't say is if you look

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,180
at this it's like it's kind of like

00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,450
roughly in the same ballpark and sort of

00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,820
it's cheap enough in 2016 but the fact

00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,860
is this is actually very expensive and

00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,560
which you find out about that is to you

00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,930
compared to how mean how much percentage

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,390
of the gross national income per capita

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:15,240
which gives you a rough idea of the

00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:18,690
average income that people have over

00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,270
there and at the time on a yearly basis

00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:24,660
it's about 3 to 2 percent for those two

00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:27,200
countries whereas in the US and France

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:30,290
it's like 110

00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:33,140
of that right and so no one income that

00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,850
people have is like lower but it's a

00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,550
higher fraction of the income and so

00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:39,880
that is very expensive right and then in

00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:44,540
September 2016

00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:47,240
there was this announcement geo was a

00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,520
new carrier in India and their chairman

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,760
was like I'm going to fix this this is

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,520
not acceptable and so he announced some

00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:58,280
very aggressive plan essentially what it

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,960
is worse free domestic called forever

00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,630
for people who sign up within like the

00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,480
certain period of time and I also had a

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:09,050
welcome pack if you signed up within the

00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,970
tree next month you have immediate

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:14,900
access to all their like geo services

00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:18,590
but also for gigabyte away for free for

00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:20,210
3 months so that is like game-changing

00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,880
right and let's look at what happened

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:26,360
after that interval like pricing today

00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:30,980
so today a roughly 2018 2019 the price

00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,670
of one gigabyte is only 0.15 percent of

00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,690
the

00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:40,160
g9 and it's the cheapest go by plan that

00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:41,810
you can see you can have worldwide so it

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,240
is very very much full of them

00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,860
it might not be a forward for everyone

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,410
yet because it's still like on average

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,090
but it's it's really affordable for most

00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,170
people that we talk to when we went

00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,580
there

00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,620
Indonesia is kind of smearing it's

00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,590
slightly higher but it's still available

00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,680
for most people

00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:03,350
all right so affability is good but what

00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,070
about the speed the number one country

00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:11,480
per the open signal research in May is

00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:14,330
Korea with 52.4 megabyte megabit per

00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,970
second and then just picked up this one

00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:19,490
is Ola is actually doing pretty well

00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:21,110
it's number five Japan you would say

00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,180
that it's like one of this country where

00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:25,070
everything is super fast it's not really

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:30,050
that fast compared to Korea it's like

00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:32,810
any patent and then suddenly okay for

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:35,030
Indonesia and India it's actually a bit

00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:36,470
like at the bottom of the pile it's only

00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,280
7 megabyte

00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:41,820
megabit per second

00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:44,670
and so people when we go there they know

00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,160
it's like marketed as 4G but interesting

00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:50,610
it's like 4G but it's it's actually like

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:54,030
3G most of the time all right

00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:56,580
and we also see that to the chrome UX

00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:58,080
matrix report that we have this is the

00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,880
effective mobile connection for

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,000
different countries and so you can see

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:06,720
that the effective 4G is only half of

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,630
the time true most of the time its 3G

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,940
and it'd be worse Indonesia's graph is

00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:15,390
meaner friends is still like there's

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,830
still room to improve things japanese

00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,570
doing pretty realm right and everyone is

00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,710
like kicking it I don't know if there is

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,840
like a company that does better than

00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,370
that

00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,170
all right the other thing that's

00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:28,890
important to note is that there are a

00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:30,810
lot of users have 74 and so depending on

00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,820
the time of the day the speed of the

00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,710
connection is going to change a lot and

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,270
might be too congested in one dot and so

00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,440
if you really want to like download a

00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:40,140
whole bunch of things you have to wake

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,970
up very early in the morning otherwise

00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,740
you're going to have a bad time during

00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,020
you come during your commute and whatnot

00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,570
and so when we look at this we found out

00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,730
that maybe having API where you can like

00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,860
track every prefetch content have ahead

00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:55,170
of time based on your engagement with

00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,870
website could be interesting so that you

00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:03,840
can offset you there are users when it's

00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:05,280
fast in and whatnot like also you would

00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,990
think that even in Japan it's not an

00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,940
issue but actually this is very

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:11,160
interesting what this shows is that this

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,660
is like for every month it shows

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,060
something like you can see there is like

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,980
an interesting pattern and it's the

00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,810
number of page load per user on the

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,940
device capable of 4G and you can see

00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:24,960
that as the month goes by this number

00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:28,920
goes down right and you might wonder why

00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:31,230
that is the case and this next one kind

00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,300
of like explain what's going on this is

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,400
the page load time for device is capable

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,110
of 4G in Japan and you can see that as

00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,230
the month goes by it like keeps

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:43,140
increasing and then it goes back down

00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:48,100
and what's happening is that most users

00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:50,139
actually have a very like unlimited fun

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,779
most of them have like speaking oh right

00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:54,940
right and after that you can still use

00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:58,170
the net but it's going to be very slow

00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:01,480
and so people just don't bother anymore

00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:04,269
like me personally I have a six gigabyte

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,889
plan and I've been like in that occasion

00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:08,170
where at the end of the month I was like

00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:10,810
so told and I didn't feel like using the

00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,399
web at all anymore and this morning I

00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:16,300
checked how many like how many gigabytes

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:19,959
are used I'm 5 gigabyte on my mobile

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:22,269
plan and about 50 gigabyte on Wi-Fi and

00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:23,800
so you can mention that for people for

00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:25,870
people who don't have a laptop and they

00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,800
only use their mobile device like the

00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:31,810
data port is super important the other

00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,760
thing that goes on in in some countries

00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:36,040
like India is that sometime the Internet

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,370
is being shut down for various reasons

00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:42,399
it could be to meet access you like chat

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,959
apps to avoid having people like go

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,089
together and manifest and things like

00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:48,279
that and they are like places in India

00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:49,019
where the Internet's been done like four

00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:51,339
months

00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:52,930
so that's also something you need to be

00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:54,699
aware of like sometimes a connection is

00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:59,860
not beatable just because the internet

00:11:54,699 --> 00:12:02,050
is like just off all right okay all

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,579
right I thought like maybe we should do

00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,579
like a quiz about the next thing

00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:22,029
[Music]

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:23,470
it's enough it has 1 billion users maybe

00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:28,079
even more than that if you believe all

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:33,670
the stuffs available something is caring

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:36,429
it works offline and in fact that's the

00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:45,119
whole point of that are any I would what

00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:48,009
it is no no one it's a tough one okay

00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:49,949
it's an app called share it and the

00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:53,800
whole point of that app is to share

00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:56,439
files offline with your boyfriend it's

00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,209
very popular in India and also countries

00:12:56,439 --> 00:13:00,189
like that where the connection is maybe

00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:02,019
not always available if he back in the

00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:03,759
days it was too expensive to use it and

00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:05,829
so if you had like the letters like

00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,290
video of the famous artists you would

00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:12,339
just share it through that up with your

00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:14,319
friend and actually I saw this like come

00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:16,779
up in my feed last week

00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:18,670
Opera Mini is now shipping with an

00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:22,660
offline sharing feature for nearby

00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:24,339
friends so it is very trendy and what do

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,019
we work on like web packaging we feel

00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:27,610
that this could enable use case like

00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:29,470
that like if you have the app it's

00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,420
already like contained in the package

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:34,839
you could share it with your friend

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:37,089
nearby and so we are settled by that

00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:38,769
also it can speed up loading because if

00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:41,980
you already have all the resources you

00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:44,470
need to have something like ready to go

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,790
on your device that you don't need to

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,829
care too much about the connection

00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,809
anymore you can have a very interesting

00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:52,360
like discovery experience where you have

00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:54,790
a feed of interesting apps or content

00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,459
that are ready to go and you can even

00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,230
make those things enticing you can have

00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:01,809
like a game that shows the gameplay loop

00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:04,149
and then when you click on it it just

00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:06,069
launched instantly and seamlessly so I'm

00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:09,819
excited about that with web packaging

00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:12,970
and polos and all the ideas like that ok

00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:15,519
let's talk about the device landscape so

00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:17,700
we actually went to enjoy get to go to

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,610
Indonesia I'm trying to do that after

00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,650
in November and so what we did is we

00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:25,530
went shopping for like devices to get a

00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:27,120
feel of like what's available and we

00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,830
quickly realized that they were a lot of

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,950
like brands that we had no idea about

00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:35,130
like for instance this device series is

00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:39,120
made by Apple which i think is a Chinese

00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:40,590
brand from a different like om and so

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,510
some very interesting things have been

00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:44,520
in there and then the other one is dudes

00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:47,870
like feature phones very popular in

00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:52,230
market like India I think there is about

00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:54,570
100 million device like that sold across

00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:56,700
the whole world there is 1.5 billion

00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,320
feature phone already still in use today

00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,850
so there is still a lot of like

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,360
potential for this like feature phone

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:05,070
device that actually like pretty close

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,210
to being as good as a smartphone in term

00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,170
of what you can do on it

00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:12,510
they have like apps a iOS is built on

00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:17,790
web tech and so that is very exciting to

00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:19,440
see so it'll not the right one cap it's

00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:22,590
essentially a lot of like Android

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,930
devices and tell us devices in terms of

00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:28,020
like what kind of device you can see

00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:30,930
it's mostly at the low end of the

00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:33,780
spectrum so for instance this one is the

00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:36,810
most popular smartphone you can see in

00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:39,420
India it's a model that only has one

00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:42,360
gigabyte of RAM there is like an update

00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:46,050
in 2018 with I think three or four

00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:50,280
gigabyte storage wise it's very limited

00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:51,960
it only has 8 gigabyte and yeah it kind

00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:55,470
of like lags behind interval like what

00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:58,530
version of Android is supported Korea's

00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:01,830
device there are about 70 to 90 million

00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:05,390
of Jews in India it's a very low-end

00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:08,640
device it only has one one 1/2 of a gig

00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:12,090
but the other thing is that it is mostly

00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,710
free like if you sign up with geo you

00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:16,320
would get this device for free as long

00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:18,480
as you are willing to pay a tiny fee for

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,290
the mobile platform I don't know couple

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,700
of years and anything like that the only

00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,040
thing we notice is that because the

00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,950
storage is like very small all those

00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,709
devices come with a micro as

00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:32,750
and you can buy a microSD come and

00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:35,480
interestingly seeing is that some of

00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:38,600
them come preloaded with content so this

00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,630
one has the YouTube go up that just it

00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,209
only it also has like content so that

00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:46,370
was very interesting to see the other

00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:49,850
things that people do when you buy a

00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:53,089
device the declared might like load up

00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,740
your device with apps on the side so

00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:59,829
that was interesting and a bit scary to

00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:03,320
be honest okay and on my way back home I

00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:07,250
bought the latest like low-end devices

00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:11,540
and so there's this G 2 version 2018 and

00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:14,949
a g6 plus from Samsung and it's like 2

00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:18,620
gigabyte of RAM a bit more storage a

00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:21,740
Snapdragon 425 and then same thing

00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:24,890
roughly for the G 6 plus with more RAM

00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:31,010
and more storage but same CPU and the

00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:32,690
price is very like a foldable okay and

00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:35,090
then the question is like okay those low

00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:38,540
end device that constitute the the bulk

00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:44,360
of what people use in this market other

00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:46,580
games all right so this is like a

00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,710
benchmark of like the different like CPU

00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,260
that are available today on different

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:53,750
devices so you have the very I n like

00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:56,510
typically iOS devices or like the top

00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,980
end of Galaxy devices and you can see

00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,410
that every year like things are getting

00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,880
like higher and higher for this ones but

00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:05,660
then if you if you look at the budget

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:08,330
one it's like no it's like very like

00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:10,280
there is like a lot of gaps right and

00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,770
then at the very low end the green one

00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:16,070
is that there's no cure to device which

00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:19,640
is like just roughly in the ballpark of

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:22,910
like 2014 like it's like five years ago

00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:27,950
and then the two device I bought this

00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:32,900
one's actually are way way way way down

00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:35,240
there right so like gigabyte of ram is

00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:37,990
one thing but a CPU that were you get on

00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:41,289
this low-end devices is like very

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:43,450
limited and it's not the father um right

00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:44,980
they want to heat a target point and so

00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,690
they are going to find ways to make that

00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,700
happen and speak either it would like

00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:52,600
cut down on the things that people don't

00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:54,340
necessarily understand but so the device

00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,960
is not gangster but at least it gives

00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,559
the opportunity for users to access the

00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,149
web so that's good about it and it's our

00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:03,100
job to make sure that the experience

00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:06,820
that we create can scale through the

00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:09,820
whole gamut of devices all right

00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:14,789
Indonesia about this meter it's a lot of

00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:17,649
like sub $200 devices so same teacher

00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:19,510
the other thing we did is we talked to a

00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:22,570
different user a special user who were

00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:24,789
like considering buying a smartphone or

00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,710
already had a low-end smartphone to try

00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:28,750
to understand what is the motivation and

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:32,529
anything like that so a couple of things

00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:34,029
we learned first of all is that they

00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:36,399
don't have the same background that we

00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:38,860
do like a little about you but I've

00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:42,240
grown up with the internet right I was

00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:46,720
using the Internet all my like page IBM

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:49,779
pension machine right and so I know what

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,549
the web is what it is for whereas do

00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:53,320
user for most of them it's the first

00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:55,659
time I did account they come online and

00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,149
so they have no expectation whatsoever

00:19:55,659 --> 00:20:00,340
about the where they buy the device and

00:19:58,149 --> 00:20:02,320
whatever is on the screen is what they

00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,450
are going to try first right and so they

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:08,860
hear from their friends about apps like

00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:11,110
what's up and see like that yeah so it's

00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,179
good to know that they don't understand

00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:17,559
like things like tab and all of that URL

00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:20,529
none of that makes sense the motivating

00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:23,020
factor for most of those users were

00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:25,510
things like they wanted to keep in touch

00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:27,940
with their family and friends or their

00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:31,120
kids as they go study in different

00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:33,730
cities for instance the other thing was

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,830
a desire to learn and so having access

00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:39,250
to information the school also is

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:41,200
investing in web websites and seem like

00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:44,590
that so all of that like were their

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,210
primary motivating factors the other

00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:48,700
thing that goes on is that most of these

00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,620
users can afford to buy one device

00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,200
and that device gets shared for the

00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:56,860
whole family right so that's also

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,320
important to note as I said like storage

00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,480
is a big concern it's very limited and

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,270
so people do micromanage everything and

00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,720
so when we talk to partners developers

00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:09,100
and and so on their main concern is like

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,230
to reduce the amount of storage that

00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:14,260
they're abused so that they stay below

00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:16,060
the radar and don't get evicted right so

00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:19,180
that's a big concern for developers over

00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:21,850
there the last one is in thermal use

00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:23,860
case it's it's really about being more

00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:26,500
independent trying to improve your

00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,960
livelihood helping your kids like grow

00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,490
and like learn and have the best option

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,910
available for them to have a better

00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:35,860
future so those were the main things in

00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:38,680
terms of like discovery they were using

00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:42,940
search YouTube there is a real appetite

00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:45,130
for videos for literacy reasons I think

00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,710
literacy right and enjoy is about 74

00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:50,830
percent so there is that and there is

00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:52,270
also a lot of like language issue a lot

00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,100
of content available in English is not

00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,960
really accessible for a lot of users

00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,610
over there and so when we talk to

00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,160
partners they wanted to double down on

00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:01,720
like content that is written in a

00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,790
language that people over there can

00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:07,870
understand and India has a lot of like

00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:09,790
different languages okay yeah that's the

00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:12,430
other one is like a finicky language

00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:16,060
reading input all of that is very hard

00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:18,550
for most users okay let's look at how

00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,930
the web is used over there so there are

00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,880
many ways we could look at it but I felt

00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:25,270
it would be interesting to do this thing

00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,070
that you one did which is compare the

00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:28,960
side that people only access within

00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:31,150
those countries but it's like the

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,840
website that we want to use across the

00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:37,240
whole world so if you look at Indonesia

00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,760
you can see that the local origin the

00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:43,570
set of sites that are only used within

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:45,340
Indonesia is much higher than the set of

00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,030
website that people tend to use across

00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,150
the whole world

00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:51,010
so that is indicative of a very vibrant

00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,800
ecosystem of developers over there that

00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:57,760
builds things for the local users so

00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:59,080
that's really good to see India is kind

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,179
of interesting because you would expect

00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,399
as expect a similar feature

00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:06,070
but it's he'll like roughly half in half

00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:08,440
and reason for that is that for a long

00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,909
time the device is a mobile data plan

00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,599
all of that was not really affordable

00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:14,169
and so the audience was kind of like the

00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:15,909
idiot

00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:18,179
people who can read and speak English

00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:21,070
and so that's what you are seeing here

00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:23,950
but the partners we talk to you really

00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:25,419
want to if you like the markets already

00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:28,059
tapped out and so they want to move on

00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:30,210
for local languages and like trying to

00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:32,799
improve the local origin situation and

00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:34,809
at the extreme I think this should look

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,749
like something like this this is Japan

00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:40,719
it's roughly only like local stuff right

00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:42,489
and for big business right the Japanese

00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:44,440
language is very specific right it

00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:46,989
doesn't look like anything like English

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,789
right and so there is a preference for

00:23:46,989 --> 00:23:52,509
things that are built for the local

00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:55,119
language and for the local needs all

00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:56,859
right and you can see that Japan like

00:23:55,119 --> 00:24:00,729
totally kills it in terms of like number

00:23:56,859 --> 00:24:02,559
of local websites enjoy still like it's

00:24:00,729 --> 00:24:05,339
it's pretty high but I would expect to

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,570
surpass Japan at some point and

00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:12,999
Indonesian might be broke in between I

00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:14,950
would say all right now if we look at

00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:17,769
what kind of like tech has been used

00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,960
over there is there like seeing anything

00:24:17,769 --> 00:24:22,149
specific to those markets that doesn't

00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,549
exist here those kind of questions and

00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:27,219
if we just look at the mobile local

00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:29,710
origin it will give us an idea of what

00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:32,440
is being used I think this was mentioned

00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:33,879
yesterday Henry mentioned that jQuery is

00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,929
the number one like most popular

00:24:33,879 --> 00:24:41,109
framework it is true for all markets so

00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:45,159
you have like in Indonesia sorry India

00:24:41,109 --> 00:24:48,519
and in red Indonesia euro is Japan and

00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:50,999
then drina's us so you can see jQuery

00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:53,549
bootstrap jQuery migrate wordpress

00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:57,070
jquery UI modernizer

00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:58,659
Microsoft asp.net and then we act like

00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:01,719
they're the new hotness is still not

00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:07,869
quite there right then a bunch of things

00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:11,589
like animated CSS lightbox okay all

00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:13,389
right so with all that what can we like

00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:15,700
is the user experience going to be good

00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:18,700
or not and so one way to look at it is

00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,440
essentially like lighthouse as I was

00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,859
mentioning yesterday the imagine

00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:26,440
lighthouse course is around 41 and you

00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:28,629
can see that Japan India Indonesia are

00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:33,159
actually doing better than the median

00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:35,320
score right and unlike let's say the

00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:37,899
country like Australia like they are

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,299
doing pretty well on that basis the

00:25:37,899 --> 00:25:42,369
downside of lighthouse is that it is a

00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:44,710
lab measurement and so it doesn't

00:25:42,369 --> 00:25:47,219
necessarily reflect the situation in the

00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:53,079
countries that people experience those

00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:55,960
websites okay and so if we look at the

00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:57,759
actual user data from from UX metrics

00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,979
this is just showing the first

00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:03,070
contentful paint for different countries

00:25:59,979 --> 00:26:04,659
you can see that the picture looks very

00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:08,469
different right on the previous slide

00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:12,429
like Indonesia was actually much faster

00:26:08,469 --> 00:26:16,509
than Japan for instance but in reality

00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:19,629
it's not the case right the opposite is

00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:21,849
true and the same for engine and

00:26:19,629 --> 00:26:24,369
essentially this is because of a

00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:26,259
combination of low-end devices and also

00:26:24,369 --> 00:26:28,929
a connection that is not always fast

00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:34,229
sometimes not beatable and so that does

00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:37,389
explain a lot of like those issues okay

00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:39,879
so in short like we got a lot of things

00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:42,159
to bank against her and so we we have a

00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:45,279
lot of work to do especially on finding

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,200
ways to avoid being too reliant on a

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,969
network connection like I think it's a

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,820
bad idea to wait until the last minute

00:26:48,969 --> 00:26:54,159
to load something I think like loading

00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,509
ahead of time to things like web

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,969
packaging and all of that

00:26:55,509 --> 00:26:59,859
no you can improve discovery but also

00:26:57,969 --> 00:27:03,009
the reliability of the user experience

00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:05,169
and do things normally makes sense for

00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:08,049
markets like dues but if you think about

00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:09,940
it even for markets like Japan u.s. and

00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:10,960
all of that there are many reasons why

00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,969
an instant

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,759
renewable experience is something that

00:27:12,969 --> 00:27:17,510
people have come to expect based on the

00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:20,030
kind of experience that they have true

00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:22,130
give apps and so there are set of things

00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:23,570
we could do that will improve the user

00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:26,450
experience for users over there that

00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:29,240
would also help our users in like more

00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:31,340
common markets and obviously there is

00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,020
still a lot more things to learn it

00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,760
would be interesting to see what kind of

00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:36,770
innovation those countries come up with

00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:40,130
because they have very unique challenges

00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:42,530
I do mention it and talk but like in

00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,060
them of like payments a lot of users

00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:46,220
over there don't have the bank account

00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:48,080
and so there is this question of K or

00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:50,780
how do I pay for goods on an e-commerce

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,700
website and so for a long time people

00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:55,640
were paying when they were receiving the

00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:57,650
good the good will be delivered to them

00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,570
and it would pay on delivery which is

00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:01,730
something that maybe people get back in

00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:03,410
the days but not so much anymore and so

00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:06,140
there is a whole set of like things that

00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:09,290
could be done better for these markets

00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:11,540
as well in Japan interesting enough

00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:14,270
there is a resurgence of payments

00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:16,340
through QR code which was the thing back

00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:18,200
in the days didn't work out so it would

00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:23,990
be interesting to you to see why this

00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:26,090
time around it will change alright I use

00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:28,160
this like picture which I took in in job

00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:31,490
because I felt it was funny to see that

00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:35,240
someone had website looking email

00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:37,010
address but actually thinking about it

00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:40,700
like what I did is essentially a burst

00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:42,050
alright this idea of like okay let's do

00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,500
a quick overview of like different

00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:48,170
markets so I hope I didn't like what way

00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,970
the countries are like other ways it's

00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:53,330
not been this way it's men what you pick

00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,860
your curiosity and like trying to have

00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,540
you think about like what is you you

00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,980
could do maybe you're a framework holder

00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,420
you want to care about low-end devices

00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,970
you want to make sure that when people

00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:03,380
use your framework the user explain that

00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:05,720
they are going to build is going to

00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,920
scale across the gamut of landscape

00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,050
sorry

00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,760
across the gamut of devices and so

00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,620
hopefully this is like eh interesting

00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,990
enough for you to think about what are

00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,820
the ways you could take those

00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:18,920
opportunities in mind when you build

00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,900
something or create something it could

00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,150
also be like just documentation like

00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:27,890
making documentation available in more

00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:28,730
languages could also help and with that

00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:34,619
thank you

00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:34,619
