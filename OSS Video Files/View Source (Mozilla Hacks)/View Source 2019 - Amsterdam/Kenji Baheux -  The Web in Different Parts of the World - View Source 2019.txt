This talk will provide insights about markets that tend to be not well-understood such as India or Indonesia. The goal is to provide an overview of what makes these markets interesting but challenging, e.g. data about the device landscape, state of the web and native apps, connectivity challenges and evolution, opportunities. Parallels will be drawn to more familiar markets to show that efforts motivated by these markets can also benefit other markets.
