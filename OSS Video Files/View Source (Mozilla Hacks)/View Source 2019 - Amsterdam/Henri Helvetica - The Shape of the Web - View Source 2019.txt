“The Shape Of The Web” is about both accomplishments and challenges that lay in the past and present of the web. In his opening keynote, Henri Helvetica looks back in time and forward into the future, at the technologies the web has employed, but also at the future of its employed technologists.

He remembers the textual academic web of the early 1990s, and the sea change that came when a browser allowed for both text and images to be displayed in the viewport. And he identifies some of today’s challenges in ensuring that the “gateway to the riches of the internet” remains open and inclusive for all.
