Title: Henri Helvetica - The Shape of the Web - View Source 2019
Publication date: 2019-11-22
Playlist: View Source 2019 - Amsterdam
Description: 
	#henrihelvetica #viewsourceconf
“The Shape Of The Web” is about both accomplishments and challenges that lay in the past and present of the web. In his opening keynote, Henri Helvetica looks back in time and forward into the future, at the technologies the web has employed, but also at the future of its employed technologists.

He remembers the textual academic web of the early 1990s, and the sea change that came when a browser allowed for both text and images to be displayed in the viewport. And he identifies some of today’s challenges in ensuring that the “gateway to the riches of the internet” remains open and inclusive for all.

thank you very much Ruth Ruth is my girl

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,360
right there it's funny I have this

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,250
saying where I usually don't trust

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,539
people with two first names with John

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:21,600
but she's still my girl still it's a bad

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,699
joke I know it's funny I was just

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,410
looking at the photo of myself on screen

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,800
and I'm I'm actually wearing the same

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,660
shirt and I have the same watch on and I

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,300
actually would have warned the hat that

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,450
I'm wearing there but I lost it so that

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,180
would have been very strange anyhow good

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,700
morning good morning Amsterdam

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,010
I'm definitely or a good morning Dom for

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,860
the few of you out there who follow me

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,020
on Twitter I like to start my days just

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,789
reading the Dom for whatever reason I

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,039
don't know how that started but it just

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:56,039
became a thing so you'll see a lot of

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,590
that for me but like I said good morning

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:02,219
Amsterdam I'm super stoked to be here

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:06,299
it's funny because I used to I kind of

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,560
came from music and I had friends of

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,580
mine who had come through Amsterdam

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,049
quite often on performances whatnot and

00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,299
I used to just kind of dream of being

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,970
out here and when I had an opportunity

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,770
to come out for this time around I was

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,540
just like I absolutely have to go to

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,100
this one venue because a bunch of my

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,990
friends performed there and I don't even

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,259
know how to pronounce this if anyone's

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,439
from Amsterdam he orders Dutch is BIM

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:34,020
BIM house I don't know whatever it is

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,659
but it's a gorgeous venue and it's

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,270
actually not even too far from here so I

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,890
plan on walking by checking it out but

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,200
like I said a lot of my friends have

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,439
performed there and I was always super

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,939
jealous but I mean I just did what all

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:52,140
sort of like successful musicians do is

00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:56,880
quit and make money and become a

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:58,829
developer so yes my name is aji last

00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,880
names not Helvetica it's just a known

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,350
poem I thought would be kind of

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,380
interesting but people seem to gravitate

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,460
towards it and believe it's my last name

00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,380
but nonetheless that is my twitter

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,000
handle that's my instagram handle if you

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,260
want to see me do nothing on instagram

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,440
I'm from the greatest city on the planet

00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:20,540
a city called Toronto I love it there

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,760
super multicultural I like we've said I

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:26,060
tend to sort of like work in the

00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,560
performance space I also run a couple of

00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,030
meetups money as the performance meetup

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,740
one is another one recently I started

00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:34,670
just out of interest which is the jam

00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:37,160
track one and as you could tell I'm a

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,800
professional bodybuilder that's what I

00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,709
do in my spare time but all jokes aside

00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:46,790
I do actually partake in some activities

00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:50,630
and I'd like to run and in fact one of

00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:53,180
my Shiro's is sarah and hassan who's

00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:55,250
actually a dutch resident she just

00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,470
recently run the 10,000 rended 10,000

00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,410
meter a championship and won so I was

00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:02,120
pretty stoked but I'm a big fan of hers

00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:07,520
and in fact I got to meet her for the

00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:09,230
first time this summer and this was in

00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,900
California but I'm keeping with like

00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,150
European rules because gdpr the whole

00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:17,200
right to be forgotten kind of thing is

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:22,030
that how it goes

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:26,900
yeah that is not me apparently

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:28,190
nonetheless I'm here a few source to the

00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,290
view source people thank you very much

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,239
for having me for the second time

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,799
I loved it the first time around it was

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,299
a fantastic experience so I want to

00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:37,459
thank you for for having me this time

00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:41,269
around as well and we're gonna talk

00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:43,370
about what I believe is a pretty safe

00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:45,769
statement or correct one the web is in a

00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,840
great place some you may have some

00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:51,590
disagreements potentially but I'm gonna

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,350
tell you why I believe it is what it is

00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:56,600
right now so let's talk about the web

00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:58,910
webs have been around 30 years we more

00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,980
or less know that but do you know what

00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,720
you were doing about 30 years ago maybe

00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,489
some of you may not have been around

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,430
some you were just super young like

00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:09,950
myself but thirty years ago this ban

00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,870
right here put out the very greatest

00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,220
record anyways this is motley crew and

00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,920
they put out a record three years ago

00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,239
called dr. feelgood their greatest

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,989
accomplishment anyhow

00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:23,390
thirty years ago we also had this great

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:24,920
cartoon can't believe it's been 30 years

00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:27,670
in chain

00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,870
but on records one the grace around and

00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,640
we had one of the greatest

00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,100
disappointments in music history right

00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,930
here milli vanilli we all know what

00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,240
happened if you didn't it's a bit of a

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,160
sad story but you know it was the

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,410
greatest ruse what I'll say

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,580
but three years ago around there some

00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,770
people were starting to get on the web

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,900
and not you know shortly after that I

00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:50,600
did and I went out and got one of these

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:53,270
things which is obviously a modem it

00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,070
allowed me to do things like this go to

00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,840
news groups and news groups for those

00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,090
who don't know that's what I consider

00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,170
sort of like the original social network

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,850
you're hanging out with people you

00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,440
didn't know and you're like oh dude I'll

00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:07,460
totally trade you mixtapes or whatever

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,560
and you actually did that I also did

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:12,070
things like this I went to Alta Vista

00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,420
which was my preferred search engine

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,420
shout out to all the people from the big

00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:20,600
G that I know who were in the building

00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:24,880
and I also did this I used Netscape

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:27,650
Navigator and it was one of the first

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,630
browsers I was introduced to but it did

00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,670
everything I needed needed to do and I

00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:34,490
loved it

00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:36,770
sidenote I go to California so often I

00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:39,950
have some family out there I was super

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:42,290
stoked one day and I went and drove to

00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,790
the original offices of Netscape and I

00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,700
just sat in front of the address and

00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:49,310
took a photo I don't know why but I

00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:53,830
thought it was so cool nonetheless and

00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:56,030
at 6:50 Castro's magnitude California I

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:59,000
like them so much this is my avatar

00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:00,470
right now so if you ever see this you're

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,070
like I don't know if that's him really I

00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:06,670
don't see a face that actually is me but

00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:11,210
when Netscape

00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:13,100
was released this statement was made the

00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:17,270
software is going to change everything

00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:19,400
I mean you probably had a decent idea

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:24,170
that I was gonna do something all right

00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:26,390
but to further things the original p.m.

00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:29,090
on Java came police he added this

00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,350
statement things started exploding with

00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,180
the invention of the browser because

00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:34,670
suddenly the internet was accessible to

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,650
the average person and that was more or

00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:39,110
less correct because your average

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,030
claspers person was getting a modem you

00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,610
know buying a dumpy computer may have

00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:47,030
had one already and was able to access

00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:49,580
the net at the time and what happened

00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:51,560
was we had 65 million users in 18 months

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,050
that was an adoption rate that I'd never

00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,759
been seen before so much so that the

00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,009
people at Microsoft were like clutching

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,520
their pearls and just like what's going

00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:05,210
on here but fast forward to today we

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:09,020
have 4.5 billion users online that's

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:10,610
just over in around 55% and you might

00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,530
think like man that's like a large

00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:15,080
number like what's going on how are

00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:17,300
things progressing so quickly that so

00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,490
many people would be online now you know

00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,260
there are a lot of things in business

00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,600
that happened that are kind of like

00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:27,169
happy accidents or things you just could

00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:36,169
not predict that go extremely well like

00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:38,539
velcro like viagra but one thing that no

00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:41,270
one predicted was this the mobile phone

00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:43,490
no one realized that first it was going

00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:46,160
to be created second it was going to be

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,380
as powerful at it as it is as you know

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,570
some people have said before some of

00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:53,320
these phones are more powerful than the

00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,880
technology that took people to space and

00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,400
that's really important because that

00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,620
also drove the adoption and the adoption

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,570
it was so strong that you had moments

00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,370
like these and this is one picture that

00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,979
I actually love talking about because

00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,180
you're talking about a community that

00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:12,830
generally has shunned all things

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:15,320
technology you know it's like manual you

00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:19,639
know mowing the lawns I kind of but

00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:21,560
somehow they have a smartphone this is

00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:24,560
another another powerful picture that I

00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,030
like to sort of parade around now think

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,820
about this if you're talking about

00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,409
remote locations you're talking about

00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,970
suspect connectivity but they're

00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,200
actually on a phone now it might not be

00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,270
a smart phone it might be a feature

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,150
phone but they're actually on a phone

00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:40,520
and they have access to the Internet and

00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,870
like I said it might be a feature phone

00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,310
because we've seen a little bit of

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:49,430
resurgence in that area of sort of like

00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:53,290
devices and in fact whoops

00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:55,610
work alright this is a quote that I

00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:57,170
lifted from an interview with Mike

00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,410
Taylor where he talks about and I think

00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:01,640
he's in the room somewhere still a lot

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,260
of feature phones out there in the

00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,050
market tons of people are using them

00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:08,649
using these phones right now and this is

00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:11,720
absolutely correct you talked about

00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:14,270
areas of the globe where you know these

00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,100
moderate to low power devices are the

00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:19,730
ones that people are picking up due to

00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,709
price points these are these things are

00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:24,709
very important but they're actually able

00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:25,910
to get on the net so what are we doing

00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:27,080
with some of these phones whether it be

00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:30,050
featured but especially with the

00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:33,070
smartphones what can we do today in 2019

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:34,190
well we can do a lot of different things

00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:39,640
whoops

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:41,420
pardon me like we might go on a date

00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,320
online dating is big

00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,790
I've never partaken but I here it is and

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,740
you know to go on this date we'll might

00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:52,430
get dressed up so we'll go online

00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:56,870
shopping then we'll go rent a car to go

00:09:52,430 --> 00:10:00,200
on this date here a Chevy Impala we

00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:02,209
might listen a tame impala through our

00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,420
mobile device while we're on this date

00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:10,550
and we'll go ahead and order over eats

00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:12,700
online and eat empanadas see what I did

00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,700
there

00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,510
but there's so much more you can do and

00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,640
what I want to do in the next little bit

00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:22,550
we're going to talk about what I feel is

00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,839
the shape of the web the technology the

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:27,020
technologists that are going to be

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,170
involved in making things a little

00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:32,630
better along the way so one thing I like

00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:35,600
to talk about and how important this is

00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:37,130
is collaboration collaboration is key in

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,950
a lot of different industries and it

00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:41,870
absolutely will be in the web for sure

00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:43,270
we have front-end developers that's for

00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,190
sure

00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:48,529
any back-end developers in the room not

00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:51,560
that I can see all right be proud throw

00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:54,040
that hand up we obviously have designers

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:58,400
designers are important in this process

00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:00,709
we have user experience professionals we

00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,000
also have author experience people this

00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:03,230
is something that I picked up a couple

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,090
weeks ago is out of conference

00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,380
and someone mentioned author experience

00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:10,310
I'm like what is that

00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:11,780
but the CMS developers talk about the

00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,030
author experience because they need to

00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:17,810
create tools for the authors who are

00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:20,660
then also releasing product out there

00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:24,680
for users in the end so at the end the

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:27,410
day all of these people work together to

00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,500
create a proper developer experience

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:34,640
than in the end that that comes out as a

00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:37,970
good product for the user I think it's

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:41,540
actually dope I think it's an amazing

00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:42,410
process and again for short I'm just

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,240
gonna call it dope

00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:47,540
but speaking of dope let's talk about

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:51,680
dope who's heard of a language here

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:53,900
called dope all right I didn't think so

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,790
it was a failed language but it was a

00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,910
language nonetheless it stood for

00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:02,300
Dartmouth oversimplified programming

00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:05,330
experiment like I said a fade failed

00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,980
language and it was released by this

00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:11,330
gentleman right here his name is John

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:13,430
Kemeny Hungarian math mathematician was

00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:16,640
a professor at the University of

00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:20,680
Dartmouth he believed that he could put

00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:25,570
a team of stem and non-stem people

00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:28,910
together with the goal of getting

00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:31,370
non-stem students to get into

00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:34,160
programming and he felt that this could

00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,050
definitely happen because dope the

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,000
language was something that he was

00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,340
basically working on that was going to

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,590
do that get non-stem types into

00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:45,380
programming so he had these teams work

00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:47,900
together collaborate and eventually they

00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:50,900
released another version of the program

00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:56,060
or the programming language and that was

00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:58,850
called basic who's here who hears heard

00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,730
of basic or used basic alright that's

00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:08,300
what I'm talking about

00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:12,230
basic I consider a success basic was a

00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:16,250
collaborative effort and as you know it

00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:16,460
became the big language that it was it

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,070
was

00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:21,320
seen as what many will now call an

00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:24,470
inline team and this is a quote from his

00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,720
daughter it was a successful project as

00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:30,770
a collaborative effort

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,330
I mentioned the meetups why because we

00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,880
mean most of us probably attend meetups

00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:37,280
at some point I believe that the best

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,110
meetups out there because some meetups

00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,200
are poorly attended some you mean

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,990
moderately the best meetups or the are

00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,300
going to be the collaborative efforts

00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:50,000
you know I may have a speaker who deals

00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:52,310
in mobile but he also deals I don't know

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,380
and react native and I may reach out to

00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:56,720
the Iraq Meetup and say hey let's come

00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:59,540
together and create a better meetup for

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,280
the developers so that they can all sort

00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:04,010
of take something back again the

00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,600
collaborative effort with a success at

00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:09,140
the end that is going to be the shape of

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,990
the web I like to talk about respect as

00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:15,440
well having respect for developers

00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:19,070
imagine that how about we talk about

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:22,160
things like documentation writing proper

00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:25,190
documentation who here has had to read

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,800
some wacky docs in the past yeah I

00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:32,180
thought so I'm just gonna leave this one

00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:34,760
up here you have good docs

00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,650
people will talk about them people talk

00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:41,180
about your good docs people start

00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:43,130
reading them so next year I'm going to

00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:47,420
I've been invited to a conference it's

00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:48,980
going to be in Atlanta and can someone

00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:57,580
tell me what the date of the conference

00:14:48,980 --> 00:15:01,100
is going to be yeah I thought so a

00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:03,410
developer said that the main problem is

00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:07,640
when the whole interface doesn't work

00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:13,720
very well with your culture and he was

00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:16,160
talking about specifically dealing with

00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,940
countries outside of North America or

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:23,630
like the english-speaking countries and

00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:29,010
we're talking about specifically I 18n

00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:33,600
what most will call internationalization

00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:37,110
how important is that well shopper she's

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,360
polyphonic pjv de duque monkey-dice a

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:42,060
but remind me it could stop out the

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,300
airlock hisses Rafael who understood

00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,990
that a few of you but the majority

00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,630
didn't

00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:50,370
now imagine that imagine getting some

00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:58,350
documentation that just looks like Lord

00:15:50,370 --> 00:16:00,389
Epsom you're just gonna drop that this

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,980
will quote that I lifted off a Microsoft

00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:04,889
site one of the many pages that they

00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,870
have but he hit the nail with the

00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:09,240
growing software market far beyond the

00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:11,310
English speaking language in speaking

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,500
world it's important for the software to

00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:16,139
support various text data formats to

00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,579
reach other potential customers but I

00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:23,790
mean it's a language thing at the end of

00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:25,589
the day West boss couple weeks ago

00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,779
released a bunch of information about

00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:29,579
some of this some of the people who were

00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:33,560
picking up on his courses and etc etc

00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:37,139
and he was stunned at the amount of

00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:40,380
users he had beyond the English speaking

00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:42,920
nations and he shared it online it was

00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:47,490
very insightful he was talking about

00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:50,339
having some of the the users in Africa

00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:53,720
and then he released some additional

00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:56,220
data here and if you look at the top 25

00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,529
you know you could count the English the

00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:03,660
native English speaking countries on one

00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:07,770
one and a half hands maybe two sorry now

00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:10,949
I get back to this photo again this is

00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:15,179
why I like to circulate this photo think

00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:22,230
about what is happening beyond our

00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:24,959
shores now let's look at the number of

00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:27,809
Internet users across the globe so

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:33,720
number one China through number ten

00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:36,590
Mexico the USA's in there where the

00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,590
English speaking countries

00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:44,510
the great the greatest growth Egypt

00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:51,430
through India were the english-speaking

00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:53,900
countries now I'll tell you this much

00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:58,070
for other spanish-speaking countries

00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:59,750
github is ready they recently announced

00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:02,600
they have some documentation entirely in

00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:07,850
Spanish ready for these territories

00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:10,930
ready for these new developers let's

00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:13,670
talk about internet internet

00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:16,730
internationalization in real life I'm

00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:18,950
away here yesterday ran into a developer

00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:23,680
from Toronto I think he's somewhere in

00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:30,680
the room here and he talked about

00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:31,970
growing up and playing around computers

00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,060
and playing around with a bit of

00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:38,020
programming but around his area he was

00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:41,230
the only one he was able to why was that

00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:45,560
he was taking some English classes

00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:48,590
because he had a tutor so he was the

00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:51,680
only one in a group of kids who were all

00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:54,290
interested in software or programming or

00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:56,630
maybe you know playing around with basic

00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:58,850
back then but he was the only one who

00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,620
knew what to do because he had a tutor

00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:07,160
and he was learning English at the time

00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:10,070
I think that's totally wild and before I

00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:12,740
get into this point right here I want to

00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:14,600
talk about the fact that and this is

00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,690
something that I believe Bruce Lawson

00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:20,600
had said he talks about where's your

00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,830
next user coming from I'll go a step

00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,370
further and say where's your next

00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:27,560
developer coming from that's why the

00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:29,600
documentation is important proper

00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,250
documentation proper translation that's

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,590
going to be the future the shape of the

00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,630
web so let's talk about developer

00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,440
diversity and I know what you're

00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:41,120
thinking right now

00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:43,280
but it goes beyond that I mean I'll

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,410
start with this women technology we know

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,660
what you know we have to celebrate wins

00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:50,960
you know do not

00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:52,250
out and necessarily you know question

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,660
their accomplishments like you know that

00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,700
was actually pretty cool you know you

00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,440
want to test their acumen somehow it's

00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:05,660
like nah man they did it you know how to

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:07,040
program celebrate wins you know and I'm

00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,830
gonna touch on this very quickly

00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:12,380
shoutouts to teach us who kind of

00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:14,690
reminded me about this but I've spoken

00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,460
about this before yes I do hang out in

00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,970
the performance circles so I know who

00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,030
this is

00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:23,360
hands up if you know the name Lenna okay

00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:25,430
a few as you do but if you hang out

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,020
performance we talk about images we talk

00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:29,690
about image processing we talk about

00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:33,050
compression somehow this is the photo

00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:35,120
that became the standard photo for that

00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,870
kind of research oh you might think it's

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,360
totally cool

00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:41,120
all right well this is Lena what she's

00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:46,850
in her 20s she's like a retired person

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:49,160
now but this picture was picked up on a

00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:50,810
whim one day you know someone who was

00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,130
going to do a presentation was kind of

00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,690
sick and tired of looking at the same

00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:55,310
photo he's had all the time so he

00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,740
grabbed a magazine and he was like flip

00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:59,450
flip flip flip oh I'm gonna use this

00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:02,600
well you may think that that's pretty

00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:06,770
innocent what it kind of was until you

00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:10,220
found out that it came from a playboy 40

00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:15,020
years ago but somehow it remained the

00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:17,300
standard image unofficially so much so

00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:19,300
that's people start to ridicule the idea

00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,530
that a centerfold just remained

00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:25,760
centerfold from the 70s remained the

00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:28,610
standard the photo and I argued a few

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,020
years ago that this photo should just be

00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,970
retired because you're talking about two

00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,680
million photos two billion photos are

00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,750
uploaded to the net every day but

00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,090
somehow you still want to use a Playboy

00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:42,380
centerfold I don't think these are kind

00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:46,490
of things that really are respectful of

00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:49,220
the people that we work with let's talk

00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:51,440
about cultural diversity I mean I'm from

00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,790
Toronto and Canadian Canada is going

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,040
through a little bit of situation right

00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:57,590
now with a prime minister you know in

00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,600
his younger days he was widely now but

00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,549
these are important these moments are

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,039
important

00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:08,249
respecting the cultural diversity of

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,869
your team and they talk about all men

00:22:08,249 --> 00:22:13,879
you know you know you're gonna have such

00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:16,799
an advantage by having a cultural a

00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:18,629
culturally sort of like diverse a team

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:24,029
of developers well how about just being

00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:27,539
like a cool person first let's talk

00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:29,100
about language diversity and I'm

00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:32,730
specifically talking about things like

00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,289
CSS versus j/s and the ongoing battles

00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:38,820
that are going on there which I think

00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:41,940
Carol arias but specifically I think the

00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,679
way some developers kind of maligned CSS

00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:47,730
thinking like oh no that's no big deal

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,320
that's your CSS and I love this this

00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,850
quote from Rachel Andrew I'm not even

00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,190
sure she's here but she's due to be here

00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:55,379
around this week and I think CSS is too

00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:57,179
trivial for real developers to worry

00:22:55,379 --> 00:23:01,470
about yet too difficult for them to

00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:04,460
understand how about we just have

00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:07,739
respect for everyone and there's

00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:11,749
specialties you're good at yes that's

00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:15,149
awesome you're fantastic at CSS great

00:23:11,749 --> 00:23:17,549
you have a knack for HTML fantastic I

00:23:15,149 --> 00:23:20,369
remember Chris Corey used to say he felt

00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:22,139
that there was room for to employ

00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:24,570
someone who was just absolutely

00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:26,669
brilliant in CSS think about how

00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:29,279
complicated CSS has become these days

00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:32,580
and complicated not in like in a bad way

00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:34,080
but just it's fantastic the way CSS has

00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,330
evolved in the things that you can do

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,720
with it this start respecting the people

00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:45,749
who sort of like you know are skilled in

00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:48,749
that craft and respecting these people

00:23:45,749 --> 00:23:52,109
is the shape of the web browser

00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:54,239
diversity ah that's gonna be a good one

00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:56,669
you know we got the heavyweights here

00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:59,820
today you know I know Samsung's here

00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:03,529
shout out Google Microsoft came through

00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,529
with the troops I saw them downstairs

00:24:04,249 --> 00:24:08,489
shot us the Safari was not here WebKit I

00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:11,370
shot them a little email you know

00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:14,440
they're caught up it's all good

00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:16,030
but I know Mike Taylor again I think

00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,880
he's here but he's I believe he's gonna

00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:21,370
talk about this throughout the two days

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,410
but browser diversity is important and

00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,880
you know what long before or maybe not

00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,860
long before but right around the time

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,510
you know there was like a browser war or

00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,630
the first one as you want to call it

00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:36,730
these there was another war going on BAM

00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:40,480
oh yeah I know a few you are like you

00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:44,950
are better this one VHS versus Betamax

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,740
and you know unfortunately VHS won out

00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:50,050
the battle even though a lot of people

00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:56,590
believe that Betamax Betamax was a

00:24:50,050 --> 00:25:00,610
better product hopefully we won't end up

00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:04,170
with just like you know all of us using

00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:06,700
UC browser or something of the sort but

00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,900
browser diversity is important we're

00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,270
going to hear from some people were

00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,640
going to talk about it making sure that

00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:16,660
we have a diverse set of browsers is

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:20,790
going to be the shape of the web also

00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:22,810
open source super-important any

00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:25,840
WordPress developers in the building

00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:28,510
don't be shy throw your hands up okay we

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,120
got love for you even though your days

00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:34,420
are numbered

00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:37,750
I'm just played but you run about thirty

00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:40,300
five percent of the web who worked on

00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,810
jQuery here don't be shy we got love for

00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,290
you too

00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:45,610
just celebrated thirteen years recently

00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:48,790
number one framework out there right now

00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:50,440
to this day obviously you know some

00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:53,650
antiquated work but it's out there and

00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,360
it's you know it's there and obviously

00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:57,100
you know react is out there yeah I know

00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,600
I know I know I know react react react

00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:08,340
but guess what they're all open source

00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:08,340
but also hey thank you for having me Oh

00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:17,180
all right I mean they're doing God's

00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:19,220
work let's go specifically you know it

00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:21,140
is the act of collaboration across an

00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,180
open platform which is essential to

00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:30,200
individual growth and the collective

00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:34,310
future the collective future out of the

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:39,160
12,000 contributors to Firefox over

00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:39,160
seven just over just about 750,000

00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:46,220
contributions sorry I'm French so I get

00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:49,640
the accents wrong sometimes but just

00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:52,640
under 10% were code so what does that

00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:57,800
mean we have a collaborative team of

00:26:52,640 --> 00:27:01,100
people building a product not all

00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,780
developers not all designers I mean I

00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,730
can get into the weeds as to you know

00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:09,740
who did what but these are important

00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:12,680
moments and moments like these are the

00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:16,510
shape of the web now believe it or not

00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,510
I'm gonna speed through this deck

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,550
perform it's gonna be important I mean

00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,930
we're gonna hear about it I know there

00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:27,260
are a couple talks going on there's some

00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:29,930
tooling talks and there's a talk is it

00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:31,490
fast yet I believe it's called speed is

00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:33,350
important speed is important because

00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:35,540
you're going to be working in these

00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:39,400
territories where connectivity is kind

00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:44,240
of suspect outside of the g7 it's

00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:46,850
connectivity is not gangster you know

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:51,650
we're gonna get into things where we

00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:55,970
demand fast responses you know all these

00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:59,720
acronyms like TTFN b FC plcp that's a

00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:01,970
new one things like the speed index you

00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,730
know all these performance EP is and I

00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:10,280
think the best thing right now about you

00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:13,130
know browsers specifically is that the

00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:15,920
new EP is the adoption across the

00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:17,330
clients is getting faster and faster

00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,860
once upon a time maybe a particular

00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,540
client is like you know we're gonna do

00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,860
this and then like eight months later

00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,990
others were like okay

00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:27,350
we're gonna come aboard but now that

00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:32,299
time is reducing so all users are having

00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:34,130
a better experience I mean I like to

00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:36,530
talk about image formats all the time I

00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:38,840
mean these things are being researched

00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:40,309
as we speak today there's a format

00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,679
they're talking about called the JPEG

00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:45,140
Excel just when you thought the JPEG had

00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:47,150
seen all its variants but we have a new

00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:50,870
one being worked on again it's called a

00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:52,490
JPEG Excel and I'm sure everyone's heard

00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:55,820
well a few of you have heard about the

00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:58,490
WebP eat yes hands up maybe maybe not

00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:01,220
supported by Firefox support obviously

00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:04,250
by Chrome by the way the web P turns

00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,780
nine today I believe I'll have to double

00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:10,790
check but I believe it's an anniversary

00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:13,429
today these are important moments in the

00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:15,230
future of the web the shape of the web

00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:17,960
because we want to make sure that the

00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:20,570
web is as fluid and smooth as possible

00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:25,520
and image formats performance are going

00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:27,169
to be part of that solution you know a

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,390
lot of people are using lighthouse these

00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:31,429
days was just fantastic because you're

00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:34,610
talking about a product that has seen

00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:36,169
some great adoption despite the fact

00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:37,970
that we've been sort of beating the

00:29:36,169 --> 00:29:39,470
performance drum for a while but people

00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:40,940
are now going around saying hey my

00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:43,730
lighthouse score is this mile a higher

00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:45,559
score is that that's fantastic did you

00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:47,120
know that the median lighthouse score on

00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:54,980
the web is 41

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:56,390
yeah there's work to do hello so like I

00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,820
said there's gonna be some tooling tops

00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:00,200
during the the two days here you'll be

00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,700
able to I think there might be one today

00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,360
in fact but you'll have to double check

00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:07,549
the schedule and of course it'd be tough

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,040
for me to not mention at the very least

00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:12,380
privacy because that's obviously top of

00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:16,010
mind these days

00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:18,650
I know I was having this conversation

00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:20,299
individually about it and the fact that

00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,460
there is a challenge with privacy right

00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:24,890
now I think again is a bit of a

00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:28,340
testament to the success of the web in a

00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:30,440
sense that the challenges we're having

00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:32,990
with privacy are only happening because

00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:36,290
the web is fully here it is fully

00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:39,040
established now we just have to wrangle

00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:43,790
the challenges of tracking and all that

00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:47,380
so that leaves us with these two words

00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:50,330
the web are we in a good place

00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:55,100
again I argue that we are and I'll tell

00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:56,510
you why despite the fact that enough

00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:01,270
love this quote because it came from

00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:03,830
like a I was watching the news and

00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:06,500
what's your name she was like a little

00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:10,760
can political candidate but the dark

00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:14,210
psychic forces of privacy yes they're

00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:16,190
here absolutely and it's tough but we're

00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:18,440
gonna hear about it again this week I

00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:22,070
was gonna see this weekend sorry this

00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:26,780
week I mean we have speakers like dying

00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:29,950
Hass felt and Ryan crop and Wendy

00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:32,510
Seltzer we're gonna talk about privacy

00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:34,700
but it is kind of weird actually and

00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:38,690
I'll share a quick story last year at

00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:42,860
the view source in fact I was having a

00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:44,560
side conversation about this once upon a

00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:47,420
time there was a company that sold like

00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:51,770
rubber boots and tires

00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:54,950
they're called Nokia and they also sold

00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:56,360
phones but we talked about this super

00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,980
old phone that they had called the

00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:01,550
virtue and it's like blah blah blah

00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:03,170
super expensive and you know I never

00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,740
knew anyone else who knew about it no

00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:06,050
big deal

00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:08,360
like three or four days later it popped

00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:10,910
up in my feet somewhere a phone that was

00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:14,150
like antiquated that was nowhere near

00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:16,040
the market anymore but somehow it showed

00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:17,750
up on my feet and I was just like yo man

00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:21,290
this privacy stuff is tracking stuff is

00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:23,240
absolutely bananas but we're gonna talk

00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:26,270
about it and like I said next few days

00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:29,840
and we'll be able to figure out what we

00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:34,580
can do and one few semi blemishes of the

00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:39,110
web so when it comes to sort of like

00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:42,020
measuring the successes of the web I'd

00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:44,240
like to quote a gentleman by the name of

00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:47,150
Jason lang strophe who used to work a

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,250
Gatsby who's has he has this great

00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:49,669
program called learning with Jason right

00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,339
now

00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:55,609
and I love this quote if you want to

00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:58,429
talk metrics he wants to say commute II

00:32:55,609 --> 00:33:00,019
as a primary metric is what you should

00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:03,229
be looking at and I think it's

00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:06,139
absolutely true if you have engagement

00:33:03,229 --> 00:33:08,829
with your product that's the community

00:33:06,139 --> 00:33:12,229
responding that's a fantastic way to

00:33:08,829 --> 00:33:15,109
gauge what's happening you have

00:33:12,229 --> 00:33:17,899
fantastic framework adoption that's the

00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:20,659
community responding why because you may

00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:22,249
have had proper translation so people in

00:33:20,659 --> 00:33:26,359
other countries were able to sort of

00:33:22,249 --> 00:33:28,209
like pick up on it and adopt this

00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:33,409
framework faster than they would have

00:33:28,209 --> 00:33:35,749
prior you get people bragging about

00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:37,249
their lighthouse score that's again

00:33:35,749 --> 00:33:39,919
that's community responding because

00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:42,440
somehow you've been able to create these

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:45,649
conditions that they can sort of like

00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,690
work with the tooling get the results

00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:52,070
they want and go out and get get on

00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:54,829
Twitter and and and see the things so

00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:58,339
that being said I think the web is

00:33:54,829 --> 00:34:00,409
absolutely in great shape the fact that

00:33:58,339 --> 00:34:04,009
my parents my dad especially can get

00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:09,259
online and brag about how he updated his

00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:11,690
insurance or he bought his ticket for

00:34:09,259 --> 00:34:16,369
this 60-day trip he's going on with my

00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:20,659
mom you know across the world the idea

00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:23,450
that you know on across two days here in

00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:27,470
Amsterdam we're gonna have a multitude

00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:30,309
of dev rails we're gonna have PMS all

00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:33,559
here talking about all things Web I

00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:34,819
think that's fantastic I know we're

00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:40,190
gonna have there's going to be a talk

00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:42,109
about I believe they are and I remember

00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:44,839
thinking about a are like oh yeah I

00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:46,970
remember that and again I came from

00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:49,669
music I remember holding up a CD in

00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:53,210
front of my laptop camera one day and I

00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:56,059
don't know where these exclusive music

00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:58,970
files showed up on my desktop I was like

00:34:56,059 --> 00:35:00,829
what the hell just happened here and I'm

00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:02,550
thinking to myself like man the

00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:06,660
technology involved

00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:09,870
voodoo these days is amazing but I was

00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:12,540
wrong that was the web at work so that

00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:13,920
being said I think we're all gonna be

00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,900
here we're gonna have an amazing two

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,300
days I'm really looking forward to

00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,920
having conversations with like I said

00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,300
some of the edge people in the building

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,790
I know some Google people in the

00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:27,270
building I know some Samsung people in

00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:29,430
the building and everything in between

00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:32,190
I think the next two days we may get

00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:33,630
some decisions that you know some

00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,550
products may come out of it

00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:38,910
two months from now six months from now

00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:41,250
it may come out next year but I know the

00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:46,590
people here all of us were gonna be here

00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:48,870
building better products building much

00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:52,500
better products for users in the end and

00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:54,690
in the end we are going to create better

00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:57,360
conditions and what I like to call a

00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:59,520
better shape of the web so thank you

00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:05,739
very much and have yourself a ball

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:05,739
