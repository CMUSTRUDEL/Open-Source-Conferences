This talk covers CSS as we know it today, alluding to the specification's colorful (pun intended) past and examining how things have evolved: from clear: both; to grid. We will explore pragmatic solutions to problems web developers consistently face with CSS, as well as talk in-depth about upcoming CSS APIs and conventions that extend the language and allow a wider community to contribute to its ever-growing featureset.
