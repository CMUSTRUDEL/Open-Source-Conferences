	#@tejas_kumar #tejascumar #CSS #viewsourceconf 
This talk covers CSS as we know it today, alluding to the specification's colorful (pun intended) past and examining how things have evolved: from clear: both; to grid. We will explore pragmatic solutions to problems web developers consistently face with CSS, as well as talk in-depth about upcoming CSS APIs and conventions that extend the language and allow a wider community to contribute to its ever-growing featureset.

[Music]

00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:17,480
it's like thanks game to get started and

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:20,520
that is unlocking my computer but also

00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,960
that's good I want some participation

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:30,210
because they just got a break so humor

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:32,340
me I save you you say source view you're

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,530
the greatest crowd I can't see any of

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,020
you but I love you very very much

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,420
my name is Tavis that's pretty that's

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,940
pronounced like contagious for those of

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,460
you who need to get used to my exotic

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,930
Indian name a bit my slides aren't

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,100
changing on this machine I have no idea

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:53,699
why my laptop does show the latest slide

00:00:50,100 --> 00:01:02,300
so I'm not sure what to do here but the

00:00:53,699 --> 00:01:02,300
clock is ticking so what you drop

00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,960
there's a person back there his name is

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,110
Marcel and he's been working really hard

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:19,860
to make sure all the stuff works

00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:22,920
everybody yes that's pronounced like

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,180
contagious disease I don't have anything

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,100
containers I'll give you anything

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:32,460
besides hopefully a good talk and I work

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,320
in Germany at a company called con TM we

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,780
help our customers kind of access their

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,119
own data and enable AI use cases and

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,880
that's a lot of buzzwords but really

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,130
what I love about my job is the people I

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,110
work with like these are the people I go

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,670
see every day and they are smart and

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,320
funny and all kinds of wonderful

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,430
we're not even hiring right now I don't

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,470
think I just thought I'd share that

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,210
because I like them but we're not here

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,960
to talk today about me ready to talk

00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:01,680
about CSS the cascading style sheets the

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,350
style sheets that cascade we'll talk

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,600
about CSS kind of how it was back in the

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,080
day we look at CSS

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,050
and we'll look at CSS today and we might

00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:15,050
if there's time do some CSS that's

00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:16,160
coming up and you know we have quite a

00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,300
bit of content so I think we should just

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,530
maybe get right into it

00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:23,150
CSS back then was marvelous and I

00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,310
started with CSS when I was like 8 years

00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,940
or 10 years old and it was very

00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,860
different

00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:33,320
something like animating graphics or

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,390
placing transparent backgrounded images

00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,950
on a page was not easy like you'd

00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,440
usually have to have something looking

00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,810
like this and this is a gif or gif

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,080
depending on you know how you speak and

00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,790
prefer to pronounce the word but they

00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,260
didn't support very many colors back in

00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,590
the day so like transparent background

00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:55,390
and things would look a little bit odd

00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:57,860
moreover to do things like this was

00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:00,170
really difficult and when you did it you

00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:03,890
felt this like satisfaction whoa I

00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:05,660
created something with rounded corners a

00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,790
drop shadow

00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:14,000
you know alpha transparency gradients

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:17,269
and so on this in my day Wow old back in

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,250
my day this was a tabular layout with

00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:21,680
you know three columns and the top left

00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,150
had like a gif or Jif with a rounded

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,739
corner the middle was like a one pixel

00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,170
white thing that stretched with

00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:29,209
background repeat' and the top right was

00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:31,040
a rounded corner so this is it was hacks

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,959
upon hacks upon hacks and in some cases

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,150
we didn't even do the tabular we just

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,280
did a background image of this fixed

00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,769
size box and we're very careful with

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,980
padding to not overflow it because if we

00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:47,780
did everything would break sometimes we

00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:49,670
get the rounded corners wrong and your

00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:53,480
box will kind of bleed out of your hack

00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:56,360
and and I tell you these things because

00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,190
I want to just appreciate that all of

00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:06,560
these things and hacks that we once used

00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:08,299
to write are now two lines you can do

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,090
this with two lines now moreover I used

00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:12,590
to struggle with I don't struggle

00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,730
yeah anymore thanks to who Jing who did

00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:19,430
an incredible job just before but this

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:21,070
like what is clearfix like growing up I

00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:24,410
struck clear:both

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,850
clear but what does that mean and I

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,760
think I didn't even figure this out one

00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:30,320
flexbox became a thing right but this is

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,460
kind of how we used to do side by side

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,020
column narnia and of course this hack or

00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,190
maybe you work around or whatever has

00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,660
been reduced to more or less one line

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,830
incredible and so what I'm here to tell

00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,320
you today I tell you these things to

00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:48,500
drive home the point that CSS is

00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,690
evolving and CSS is growing fast and is

00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,479
enabling all kinds of beautiful user

00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:56,240
experiences on the web in fact because

00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:59,479
CSS is evolving today we need to talk

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,610
about CSS on today's web platform I tell

00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:03,080
you why because it might evolve before

00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,850
we stop and appreciate it today and

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,169
that's what I'd like to do with you so

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:10,610
we'll talk in detail about three topics

00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:12,650
first one is layout we won't spend a lot

00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,710
of time here because again cui Jing oh

00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:17,180
my goodness I learned so much I didn't

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,760
even know you could animate a grid that

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,830
is I'm gonna play when I go back to work

00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,539
second topic typography what's what's

00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,590
coming up with what do we have with

00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:29,120
typography today and third extensibility

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,930
and as I said we need to move a little

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,760
bit fast so let's get right into it

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:37,100
[Music]

00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,680
because again wonderful talks before but

00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:42,169
what I am gonna do is kind of go through

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,590
the way we do layout and try to answer

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:49,490
one question that comes at me very often

00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:52,520
like even in my job today let's try and

00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:55,850
do this so I'd like to show you today so

00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,919
we're gonna write as Ruth said I've been

00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,710
talking quite a bit so I'm gonna write

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:04,850
encode for most of this so let's make a

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:07,280
folder let's call it talk and we'll go

00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:12,620
into it can you all see is that font

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:15,220
size okay okay to a viewer it's

00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:19,070
wonderful I'm gonna make an HTML file

00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:21,820
let's get the font size up here and we

00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:25,070
will just write in HTML documents

00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:27,410
and what I want to do is I want to

00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:31,600
create a container with two boxes so I

00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:35,420
will just use the shortcut and box and

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,460
another box and we'll say this is box

00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,010
one and this is box - and I want to

00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,660
illustrate a use case that actually

00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,210
people on my team even asked me about

00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,980
and try and solve it today we will

00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,400
create another CSS file that will

00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:56,060
reference right here so I think it's

00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:58,460
linked and let's spin up an HTTP server

00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:02,600
to kind of show us what's going on here

00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:05,300
so we'll do that with no cache and so

00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:08,210
what we have running here is literally

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,640
nothing I'm so proud of myself this is

00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,050
the pinnacle of my career right here

00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,090
blank page

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,220
technically it's fast because there's no

00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,690
code anyway

00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,520
let's write some code so let's give our

00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,890
boxes some color here so we'll say

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,400
background red and we'll give it

00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:28,220
dimensions so with 50 height 50 and

00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,390
let's see what they look like you look

00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,600
like nothing I think I may have written

00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:34,430
some wrong Oh what is that okay

00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,020
there we go so they're both red but I

00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:39,530
want to distinguish them so we'll say

00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:42,290
box two has a blue background right and

00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:44,630
so layout we're doing layout positioning

00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:47,750
things is what people sometimes struggle

00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:49,370
with I want them side by side and so

00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,670
I've seen this on the web today where

00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:54,050
we'll try and do something like this you

00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:56,960
know and and I don't fault you that

00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:59,030
works but there's some odd space between

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,910
them that comes from I don't know where

00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:05,270
and if we inspect this what we'll see is

00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:09,110
there's no margin or really anything

00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:10,520
splitting them up let's go here and what

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,850
we see is that there's just space

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,410
between them that's okay but what

00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:18,470
happens if the height of the second one

00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:20,450
is uneven so if I have these right and

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,220
it goes to the bottom for some reason

00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,080
but I want to align it to the top so

00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,540
I'll use a vertical-align:top and this

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,340
follows I'll use vertical-align:middle

00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,700
because really I want them centered and

00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,660
then

00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:34,040
it goes under the bottom I I don't know

00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,970
why this is not too ridiculous platform

00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,919
there's something that I've struggled

00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:39,650
with and other engineers I know struggle

00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:41,480
with personally and lastly there's

00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:45,410
bottom which is also not quite the

00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:47,690
bottom but baseline is and so this is

00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:50,080
something we collaborate on extensively

00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:53,240
and full of requests at my work

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,320
there's obviously flexbox which many of

00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,600
you have heard of according to this

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,580
state of CSS the survey 90 plus percent

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,550
of people have heard of in use flexbox

00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:03,920
and flexbox is an amazing mechanism

00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:06,350
because it allows it moves the

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,790
responsibility of layout to the parent

00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,950
which is kind of where I'm going and I

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,210
believe that's the right way to do it so

00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:15,590
we'll style container and we'll say

00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:17,090
display flex we will remove the rest of

00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,560
the inline block stuff so the children

00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,980
don't know about their placement the

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,780
parent does and what we'll see is BAM

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,120
they're side by side we want a gap

00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,710
between them this unfortunately doesn't

00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,580
work in chrome but it does in Firefox

00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:33,530
it's coming instead let's talk briefly

00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:36,470
about how we space these children that's

00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:39,380
what I want to answer today who owns the

00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:42,770
margin some would say well I do margin

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:46,580
right on both or one and so do that

00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:49,340
their space is that the best solution

00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,380
I'm not convinced and I'm not convinced

00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,090
because in a situation say on mobile

00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,940
where children would rap and we'll

00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:57,680
simulate that here what would happen is

00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,950
this which kind of looks ok except

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,050
you've lost your gap and there's some

00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:06,740
ghost margin going on here

00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:08,780
this is accentuated if you apply a

00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,950
margin left to the second child instead

00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:13,370
and then on mobile you have this odd

00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:16,910
space offset so who should own the

00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:18,710
margin and my answer from experience

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,480
that seems the most correct to me I may

00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:23,090
be wrong correct me if I am the answer

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,640
of who owns the margin seems to be the

00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:29,300
parent so if we turn this flex into a

00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:32,360
grid we can get rid of this simulation

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:35,570
here and what we do is we describe our

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,000
grid template columns to be min content

00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,320
and min content or you know again Hui

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,510
Jin's talk will tell you what to use

00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,330
here

00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:45,160
we have the same layout what happens on

00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:48,220
mobile I could V immediate queries

00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:50,740
specify a different CSS rule and I have

00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,410
a wrapping layer with its minimal

00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,630
character changes now Rose apologized

00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,490
and that's what it that's what it looks

00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:01,660
like so to answer the question for

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:03,550
layout who owns the margin for me the

00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,350
answer is the parent the parent kind of

00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:09,990
lays things out and the children sit

00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:14,050
there and look absolutely pretty next

00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:15,940
all the web typography allows us to do

00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:18,430
incredible things like we create these

00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:20,560
experiences on the web that allow people

00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,600
to feel things and that's what I love

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,010
about the web it's about expression we

00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,240
do that with fonts unfortunately however

00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,730
fonts have come under some fire

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,100
particularly the famous web fonts and

00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,350
this is because some of them can be

00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,600
quite heavy like you ship a lot of code

00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,700
to you you ship like a hundred kilobytes

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,200
in some cases of just fonts and that's

00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,050
because you load character sets and

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,670
glyphs that maybe you don't need you can

00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:49,360
use things like gzip and broccoli to

00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:50,650
compress them but there could be a way

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,880
you could help this and that's kind of

00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:54,640
my goal to talk about this I want to

00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,500
show you a trick I learned from the

00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,140
documentation of like google fonts that

00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:02,200
could help you with web fonts let us

00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:05,200
explore so let's go back here let's go

00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,150
to google fonts and what we'll see is a

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,880
beautiful set of fonts let's use big

00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:13,240
shoulders display I like this name I'd

00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,440
like big shoulders someday I'll use it

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:22,270
and there seems to be a bug here because

00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:25,230
I can't really excite and I will that's

00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:29,740
good feedback for you Google I love you

00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:33,310
let's try to serve let's import that

00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:36,940
font right here and tell the body tag in

00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:42,070
CSS everything is now big shoulders font

00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:44,650
family is big shoulders display and fall

00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:48,040
back to a serif if you can't find the

00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:53,880
glyphs and that looks like how we need

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,880
text of course h1 views

00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:04,580
P lorem ipsum are no save there we go so

00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,750
it looks like this looks pretty cool but

00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,520
let's look at the network what am i

00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,110
loading here let's take a look at the

00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,430
font in the dev tools and I'm loading

00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,990
eleven point nine kilobytes which is

00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:16,370
actually not that bad I've seen way

00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:19,339
worse can we do better I've learned that

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:21,800
you can tree shake your thoughts which

00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:23,870
is quite cool so I have view source here

00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,080
and let's say I want to just look just

00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:30,440
those glyphs from Google Fonts I knew

00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:32,570
that by going to this where are we here

00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,300
and adding a quarry print and text

00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:39,680
equals these characters maybe the

00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:42,050
exclamation point and reload so this is

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,670
the font but this is serif and we're

00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:47,180
loading from 11 kV we're loading 1

00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:48,380
kilobyte we can even you probably

00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,610
shouldn't do it you should find a better

00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:54,970
way to do this but I'm just gonna you

00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:58,940
know whatever let's try this dot replace

00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:04,220
globally with nothing so we've stripped

00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:06,620
the spaces I love the web and then we'll

00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,140
save this and now we're loading just the

00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,660
glyphs on the page from 11 kilobytes to

00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:13,640
3.2 kilobytes or shipping less code

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,350
because we're tree shaking our fountain

00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,180
that makes the impact the performance

00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:20,029
impact from your web fonts significantly

00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:23,930
less but I think we can do even better

00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:25,850
and this is where variable fonts come

00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:29,750
into play variable fonts are incredible

00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:33,170
they allow you to express different

00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:36,560
types of typography pun intended with

00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:38,120
just one font and and this is great for

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,339
performance but also it's great for

00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,920
sending fewer requests and waiting for

00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:45,470
fewer responses just imagine your user

00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,300
use in in a country where the internet

00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:50,959
is intermittent or going through a train

00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:53,000
right you don't want to load in this odd

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,440
state of I have some of the font but not

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,180
all and then you have all kinds of flash

00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,920
of content variable fonts allow you to

00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,160
load one

00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:04,269
file and then tweak them a great example

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,089
of this is this ampersand is a web

00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:08,889
typography conference and their webpage

00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:10,540
was built using variable fonts like on

00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:13,420
this page I'd encourage you to go

00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:16,870
explore there's I think two fonts if not

00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:19,269
less I inspected I saw two and they're

00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:21,279
variable the variable fonts are highly

00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:26,440
customizable and they're customizable

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:29,019
using axes axes are equivalent I'd say -

00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,730
like parameters of customization think

00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:32,199
about a function in JavaScript if you're

00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,790
more familiar with that with input

00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:36,310
parameters it's kind of like that with

00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:39,850
axes and variable fonts there are

00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:42,730
built-in axes kind of standard I'd say

00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:46,420
that have CSS equivalents at least

00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:48,880
mental model II these axes are it tau

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,220
which will use an italicized font or a

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,250
italicized glyph of the font with

00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:57,160
different placing there's the slim or

00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:59,079
slant and this will not use italicized

00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,380
lists but will use Roman glyphs maintain

00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:05,860
the baseline and slightly slanted them

00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:09,430
there's what good am I saying that right

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:12,490
also known as weight thickness there is

00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:14,800
wood which is the width of the font how

00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,899
wide are your glyphs and lastly there's

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,550
the optical size and this optical size I

00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:22,750
love because it helps you with let's say

00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:24,250
when your text is smaller it will

00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,649
emphasize them a bit more they get

00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,970
thicker strokes nicer wider serifs and

00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:29,709
when it's bigger they get the more

00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:32,370
gentle stroke so it it's a really

00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:36,880
beautiful optimization these have

00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:38,740
equivalents in CSS rules that you can

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,910
there are these essentially that can

00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,399
help you think about them a little bit

00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:44,470
better but how you use and customize

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,110
variable fonts are through this CSS

00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:51,459
property fought variation settings and

00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:53,380
when you use it it looks like this you

00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:55,899
have a it's kind of like a key value

00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,940
pair right you have the axis and double

00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:59,680
quotes and the number comma separated

00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,589
until you're happy with what it looks

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,850
like and I'd love to show you practical

00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:08,430
application of this in a little bit so

00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,720
what we've got here

00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:14,730
is the fun I'm just going to pull up my

00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:16,740
variable font here so I have a font and

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,690
I'll just paste it in here now it's

00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,150
available to us so it's called recursive

00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:24,750
recursive is free open-source and beta

00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:26,460
so if you want to play github let's go

00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:32,040
ahead and import that font so we have

00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:35,850
fun cool font face I'll say the family

00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:39,270
of my font is recursive and it's located

00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:42,300
right here that's all I'm gonna do and

00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:46,260
I'm gonna say use recursive instead of

00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:48,060
the other thing and what we'll see is I

00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,550
have recursive recursive is like a mono

00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,410
space coding font now let's try and

00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,910
customize it a little bit let's say I

00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:56,610
think this is too rigid this is too

00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:59,250
straight I want to make it look playful

00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:04,740
and handwritten let's explore how we can

00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:08,070
do that font variation settings and will

00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,930
customize a custom axis so far authors

00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,540
can do custom axes that don't really

00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,710
exist by default and you can do all

00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,050
kinds of cool things with them let's use

00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,760
a custom axis they're expressed with all

00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:20,600
caps letters that's how you know they're

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,960
custom so let's look at the expression

00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:26,130
axis set it to 1 let's see what happens

00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,080
so the expression as you can see has

00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,670
changed to be a little bit more playful

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:34,800
a little bit more informal let's look at

00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:36,900
zero right it's harder in fact you can

00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:41,130
transition between them so we say body

00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:43,230
on hover I want you know I want to have

00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:50,130
a more playful approach and we'll

00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:52,560
transition font variation settings 0.6

00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:55,170
seconds ease okay and what we'll see is

00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,760
when I hover things get a little bit

00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:58,530
more playful let me zoom in here so you

00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,410
actually see that look at that you see

00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:06,510
that transition incredible we can also

00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:08,790
use a default axis for weight and we'll

00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:16,470
set it to 400 here and then transition

00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:17,430
to 900 so make it really like thick look

00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,030
at that

00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:22,740
and that is just one font with so many

00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,930
different variations absolutely

00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,640
incredible you can fine tune you can do

00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,520
all the design or you want to and that

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,630
is variable fonts very I'm really

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,960
excited about because it's good

00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:36,360
performance with good customization and

00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,300
a better user experience on speed and

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,790
with typography variable fonts is

00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,380
supported by like 86 percent of all

00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:45,000
browsers according to can I use so you

00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,830
can actually use it as part of CSS today

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,810
and I'd highly recommend it if you want

00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:51,600
to get some variable fonts and play V

00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:53,820
fonts calm is the place to do that and

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,250
I'd highly recommend it alright let's

00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,860
talk about the last topic and then we

00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:03,630
will end this plane the last topic is

00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:05,520
extensibility CSS is so sophisticated

00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:09,000
have you ever thought about what happens

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,580
when you write displayed grid or display

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,260
flex you probably haven't because it's

00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,940
so declarative and beautiful people have

00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,470
even gone so far as to say it is not a

00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,660
real programming language because it's

00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:21,120
so beautifully declarative well let me

00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:23,580
tell you friend it is sophisticated

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,790
there's an engine underneath now so far

00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:29,220
I couldn't tap into it but according to

00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:31,500
a new set of API is coming up in your

00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:35,400
browser you can tap into the engine and

00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:37,440
make CSS do its magic and extend it that

00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,210
is so that should get you excited if it

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,570
doesn't already just to imagine the

00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:44,160
things you can do

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:46,860
Houdini is let's actually just do it

00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,020
demo man I haven't talked too much let's

00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,880
let's go and look at some stuff so we're

00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,920
gonna look at a website by the

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,220
one-and-only Surma who just spoke before

00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:59,130
me and this is Houdini ready yet calm

00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,060
what we'll see is a lot of it isn't and

00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,070
that's okay because it's very

00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,140
sophisticated there are two things that

00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:06,540
have shipped in Chrome Opera Samsung

00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,940
internet and is in a candidate

00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:11,580
recommendation by the w3c and these are

00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,410
really exciting let's dive right into

00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:16,020
them and look at what we can do the

00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:17,880
first one is typed on wim and this is a

00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,900
typed object model for CSS in your

00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,180
browser I know if you knew this but

00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,460
there's a global CSS object available to

00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,950
you in the browser that allows you to do

00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,660
all kinds of interesting things for

00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:29,560
example you don't really need to work

00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,800
anymore with like straight

00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:35,470
like 10 pixels instead you could say

00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,460
this and you get a type 2 value of

00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:40,350
pixels which you can use for

00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:42,760
calculations and other things

00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:44,860
type 2 M is making things possible in

00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,960
the web that weren't before and part of

00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,670
that is animating gradients like you

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,230
just can't do this let's let's look I'm

00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:52,020
almost out of time so I might move a

00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:55,330
little bit fast but let's let's go

00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,740
background is a linear gradient 45

00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,990
degrees

00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:01,150
you know it's green to white alright

00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,370
nothing nothing magic here and then

00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:10,750
onhub let's let's use keyframes even why

00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:12,690
not change from this right to instead of

00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:17,640
green to white we'll do blue to white

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:21,130
and then we'll set the animation here

00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:23,670
animation there we go change and let's

00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:33,160
take one second go infinitely and

00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:35,950
alternate so go back and forth and it's

00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:39,010
not JavaScript I'm sorry there we go so

00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:41,260
it kind of just flashes and doesn't do

00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:43,150
anything and would type to M and we're

00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,870
almost done here with type 2 and we'll

00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:48,100
look at how we can animate this smoothly

00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:49,360
we need a bit of JavaScript for this so

00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,750
we'll create a JavaScript file here

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,760
called index KS and we will register a

00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,320
property this will use CSS local

00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,930
properties also known as CSS variables

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:03,760
and we'll tell it it's a color property

00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:08,950
write its name what is let's say color

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:11,940
stop it inherits it really does and its

00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:14,200
initial value its default is black and

00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:16,330
so we have a property that we can now

00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,770
animate and watch anime as a gradient so

00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:22,660
we'll animate the property it's it's a

00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:27,460
color stop and it was green we will move

00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:29,230
it to blue and we will here instead of

00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,770
green with just reference the variable

00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:34,830
color stop now as you can see animating

00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:47,130
doesn't work but with this approach

00:23:34,830 --> 00:24:41,970
have whoever said that saved give that

00:23:47,130 --> 00:24:45,330
person a look at the API the paint CSS

00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:48,840
paint API it'll be quick to do that we

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:52,559
need to write some CSS CSS paint worklet

00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:55,080
dot add module these live in worker

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:58,070
threads and they work differently so we

00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:02,039
need to kind of import them pwj s right

00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:03,809
we will create a file PWD is and paint

00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:08,130
worklets are just classes really so my

00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:09,570
thing they have a paint method here with

00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:12,720
a context and this is the context on

00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:16,799
which you draw so we have this and we

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:20,190
will register paint the name of my work

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:23,039
tip is I don't know dots my thing right

00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:24,330
here great and what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,279
gonna go here and maybe style

00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:27,750
I don't know style the h1 how you use

00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,399
pain worklets is with background

00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:33,149
properties so I'll say background is

00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:34,830
paint dots this will do absolutely

00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:37,710
nothing because I haven't written any

00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:41,580
code let's let's fix that so we have a

00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:43,570
context and we will begin a path we

00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:46,090
won't be in the path will begin a path

00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:50,650
and we will set the fill style to read

00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:56,310
from there we'll draw a circle eight

00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:59,680
pixels by 8 pixels radius is a pixels

00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:03,160
start angle is zero and angles math.pi

00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:07,570
times to circle and we will see TX dot

00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:09,670
fill this should in theory get so we

00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:10,900
have a red ball and the cool thing this

00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:13,110
may not look very cool but what I'm

00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,370
doing is I'm hooking into CSS and

00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:17,350
exposing this beautifully declarative

00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:26,860
API I could do anything I want I could

00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:28,510
draw the face of like but I can do all

00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,880
kinds of things so just imagine an

00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:33,610
ecosystem of paint worklets that give

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,560
you unique effects maybe not so unique

00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:37,090
if they're distributed but that give you

00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,710
special effects that you can just use

00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:40,140
with a background property we're making

00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:43,420
that we're maintaining the beautiful

00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:46,000
declarative nature while giving

00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:48,010
developers superpowers quite frankly the

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,620
layout API and Houdini allows you to

00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:53,230
hook into the display property and kind

00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:56,700
of like how you'd say display flex or

00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:59,140
display grid you can say display masonry

00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:02,530
hypothetically you like a Pinterest

00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:06,030
style beautiful masonry layout display

00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:08,470
masonry this is the power of Houdini and

00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,580
with that I was super excited about it

00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,440
just in that and then there's an

00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:13,330
animation worklet where you can in

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,270
theory turn the scrollbar and do like a

00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:17,410
seeker you could make like scroll Aramis

00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:21,580
tell you I'm getting ahead of myself

00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:27,970
this it's very very very exciting and

00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:30,310
with that let's talk take aways honestly

00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:32,530
just thinking about I love CSS I have

00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:34,240
loved CSS I've loved the hacks I've

00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:36,130
loved watching it become more

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,110
declarative what do we want to take away

00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:40,870
I wants to take away a couple things

00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:43,650
number one CSS has come a really long

00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:47,980
way do you remember the first few slides

00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:50,770
we had rounded corners with gifts that

00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:53,860
overflowed it's come a long way it is

00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:55,260
developing rapidly oh my

00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,630
[Music]

00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,670
just a global thing in JavaScript it's

00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:01,830
developed and it's developing rapidly

00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:04,350
because there's a working group that is

00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:07,170
open and that cares about developers and

00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:08,520
users and is listening you can do

00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:11,070
border-radius that's because there's

00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,780
listening and for those of you who would

00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:15,600
disagree with me I just have to say the

00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:17,730
CSS is a real programming language like

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,670
if I if I'm a CSS engineer that's a

00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:22,410
thing yeah in earlier in my career

00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:23,910
people told me oh DS go push your pixels

00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:27,990
leave the real engineering to the

00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:31,170
JavaScript developers I disagree

00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:32,910
CSS is a real programmer like I think my

00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:35,910
friend Adam who's here actually shoutout

00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:37,800
Adam says it so eloquently CSS is the

00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:40,350
easiest language to pick up but the

00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,210
hardest to perfect and this is something

00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:44,280
he said at a social event that I really

00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:47,370
really liked and so with that the last

00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:49,470
thing I'll share CSS is open and I'd

00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:51,960
invite you to get involved because it's

00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:53,550
really really really exciting with that

00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,830
hey thank you so much for listening to

00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:57,450

00:28:55,830 --> 00:29:03,380
