Every new medium looks to what has come before for guidance. Web design has taken cues from centuries of typography and graphic design. Web development has borrowed metaphors and ideas from the world of architecture. Let's take a tour of some of the most influential ideas from architecture that have crossed over into the web, from pattern languages to responsive design. Together we'll uncover how to build resilient, performant, accessible and beautiful structures that work with the grain of the materials of the web.

your time is precious and I appreciate

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,330
and appreciate you've stuck with it for

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,280
the day also thank you to someone who

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,700
isn't in the room but has been here all

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,490
day

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,440
Amanda thank you very very much for the

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:22,680
live captioning you've been doing thank

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:24,000
you to Mozilla and like a bit of

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,050
housekeeping

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,609
just I'm contractually obligated by the

00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:33,899
public speakers guild as the last

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,460
Speaker of the day to say that I am the

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,340
only thing standing between you and

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,870
going for a beer so with that out early

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,950
I feel like in this situation now

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,260
because it's been two days of like

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,210
intense talks I just want to point out

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,640
that you are the only thing standing

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:53,969
between me and going for a beer so I

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,770
would like to talk to you which is kind

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,539
of weird when you think about it I mean

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,120
I'm two levels wanted I'm good I'm here

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,280
to talk to you like some clerical error

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,460
on the part of Mozilla that's ended up

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,560
with me here but I'm gonna talk to you

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,950
I'm not really gonna stand here on the

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,979
stage why do my jawbone up and down move

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:17,280
a fleshy piece of meat and muscle around

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:20,280
inside my mouth and pass air through my

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,170
throat for like half an hour or so right

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,409
and you're just gonna sit there and take

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,950
it it's kind of a weird activity what

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:32,009
we're doing here me talking but of

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,470
course the reason why it works is

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,360
because I will be using language as I do

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,860
it and hopefully we're all well got the

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,979
same codebase in this particular

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,150
language to English in this case

00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:43,950
language is amazing I mean language is

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,630
one of the things that kind of makes us

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,000
human do but it was certainly one of the

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,920
great leap forwards and in human

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,350
civilization maybe fifty thousand years

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,079
ago the dates are fuzzy I mean through

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,000
language just through moving my jaw and

00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,250
waggling this piece of fleshy meat and

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,960
passing air through my vocal cords I can

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,689
tell you something that happened and

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,210
then you are able to revisit the past or

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,099
I can imagine something in the future

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,379
and relay that to you and you are able

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,319
to travel to the future through language

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:15,290
the language is a kind

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,420
time travel from a basic level it's a

00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,219
form of communication which is also

00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,519
amazing in other words I can have an

00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:24,200
idea inside my brain and then I move my

00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:25,849
job and down flap the piece of fleshy

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,310
meat pass air over my vocal cords

00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:30,560
vibrate the air between us and transfer

00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:34,909
that idea from my brain into your brain

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:37,849
so then languages is like a virus right

00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:40,579
it's almost involuntary I can say don't

00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:42,230
think of an elephant you thought of an

00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:44,299
elephant right that's kind of thing

00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,250
that's there the auditory equivalent of

00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:50,419
the chicken game you've pulled the

00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:52,639
chicken game and lost that phase don't

00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:54,949
think of an elephant that's from a book

00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,230
by George Lakoff he's written a number

00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:59,060
of books on language and one of the

00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:02,049
Israel women fire and dangerous things

00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,400
and he wrote this one back in 1980

00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:05,930
metaphors we live by it seems to be

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,870
particularly interested in how he is

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,430
metaphor in language in this conceptual

00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,169
metaphor which is the kind of metaphor

00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,939
we're always used to where you talk

00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:15,709
about one thing in terms of another

00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:18,109
thing and it's really useful when you're

00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:20,060
talking about something intangible so

00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:21,680
time is a classic example we can talk

00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,199
about time like it's a physical object

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,049
we talk about time moving through space

00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:28,849
time fly as time drags or we can talk

00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:31,729
about time as though it's a resource

00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:33,079
saving time and wasting time you can't

00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:34,849
do any of these things with time time

00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:38,090
doesn't do that time is is intangible

00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:42,259
but talking about time with a metaphor

00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:44,680
like that helps us conceptualize it but

00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:47,419
what George Lakoff was interested in is

00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,549
cognitive metaphors politically a

00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:50,840
political language in particular is

00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:53,120
something that's kind of fascinating

00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,430
it's the idea that the framing news and

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,439
language could maybe affect the way we

00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,719
approach thinking about things not a

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,790
sapir-whorf way but just a simple

00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:04,790
example is he says if you could have a

00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,829
debate about tax relief well before the

00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,959
debate has even begun you framed

00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:11,030
taxation as something you need relief

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,530
from all right so that's framing our

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,150
thinking I think we are guilty of this

00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,949
too on the web you know I'll give you an

00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,139
example we talk all the time but what

00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:23,210
you can do now in the browser the

00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:24,620
browser singular not browsers maybe this

00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,300
frames our thinking

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,099
so I'm fascinated with the

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,530
and the metaphor we use to talk about

00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:32,780
the medium and also to talk about

00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,819
ourselves the language and the metaphors

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,220
we borrow to talk about ourselves so the

00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:38,599
words of relatively new medium and what

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,720
happens with new mediums who tend to

00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:43,039
borrow from the medium that came before

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,690
this isn't new this is something that

00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:47,360
Scott McCloud talked about in his book

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,210
understanding comics this book I have

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,759
actually read because it's a comic book

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,620
and he's talking about how every medium

00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,919
borrows from the one before right he

00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:00,020
points out that you know many early

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,729
movies were like filmed stage plays and

00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,159
then a lot of television was just like

00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:06,169
taking radio and just adding pictures to

00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:08,360
it and it takes time for the the new

00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:11,240
medium to evolve its own vocabulary its

00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,560
own metaphors don't ropes now this

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,389
resonate with me because it reminded me

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,050
of something I had seen written

00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:17,120
somewhere else

00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,729
and that was in an article called add

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,469
our web design written by John Alsop and

00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:23,569
published in a list apart in the year

00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:25,580
2000 who is read show by show of hands

00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:28,430
who has read add our web design good

00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,810
good that's what I like to see John

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,340
makes the exact same point in this

00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,599
article nerd sorry says every medium

00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,960
borrows from the medium before and it

00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:36,590
takes time terrific article by the way I

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,750
recommend you go and read it if you

00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:40,819
haven't even though it's 19 years old

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,909
it's more relevant now than when it was

00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:45,710
written which is kind of amazing when a

00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:48,440
new medium borrows from an existing one

00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:50,870
some of what hours makes sense but much

00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,300
of the borrowing is thoughtless ritual

00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:56,599
and often constrains the new medium and

00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,460
over time the new medium develops its

00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:59,719
own conventions throwing off the

00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,360
existing conventions that don't make

00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:04,279
sense so in the word the early days of

00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,400
the web the medium that come before if

00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:09,500
you were designer was print and there's

00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,370
a lot to be learned from print but it's

00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,199
not the web and design is kind of wanted

00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,409
to recapture that control that they were

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,180
used to in print on the web that's where

00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:23,449
we got stuff like this creating killer

00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:26,270
websites by David Siegel this is 1996

00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:31,909
does anybody remember this my fellow

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:33,289
gray-haired friends yeah this was this

00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:34,849
was the guy who came up with tables for

00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:35,960
layout and spacer gifts all the stuff

00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:38,350
that a giass was talking about earlier

00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,150
um you know soda you could get

00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,640
control and this is what kind of what

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,200
John old sock was pushing back on in a

00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,750
dog web design that maybe you know

00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:49,150
control shouldn't be what we're after on

00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,790
the web here's what John said where does

00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:54,010
a new medium has emerged from the medium

00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,930
of printing who skills design language

00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:59,380
and conventions strongly influence it

00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:02,770
yet it is too often shaped by that from

00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:05,170
which it sprang killer websites are

00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:08,350
usually those which tame the wildness of

00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:11,220
the web constraining pages as if they

00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:14,710
were made of paper desktop publishing

00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:16,810
for the web he does acknowledge that yes

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,540
we have a lot to learn from this history

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:22,000
of not a sprint but preprint right

00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,800
layout you illuminated manuscript you

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,690
can see things like drop caps and there

00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,760
and all this stuff evolving over time

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,800
you know reaching its its zenith with

00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,110
the Swiss school of design and 20th

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,810
century this is the next leap forward

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,490
after language is writing now we can

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,260
communicate ideas and you don't even

00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,600
need to be in the same physical space we

00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:43,240
don't have to vibrate the air between us

00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,820
anymore I can just make marks on wood

00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,150
and I can put an idea into your head

00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:51,460
kind of amazing so what this kind of

00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,990
debate I guess between you know John

00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,060
also I was talking about the Dow and the

00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,430
flow and the flexibility of the web the

00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,290
wildness on one hand you've got David

00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:02,440
Segal talking about constraining things

00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:04,810
into you know control on the other they

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:09,640
seem to be you know two very opposing

00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:11,680
viewpoints right and they they also have

00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,390
an agreement because what they were

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,760
agreeing on is the language they're

00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:17,410
using as they talk about the web because

00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,590
both of them are talking about making

00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:23,740
web sites web sites

00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:25,150
I thought itself as a metaphor oh it's

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,320
very unfashionable these days to talk

00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,260
about web sites none of us make websites

00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:33,640
anymore right we're all making

00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:36,640
experiences web sites are very day we're

00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:39,160
making web sites um it's not that idea

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,130
of a site it's something you go to any a

00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:44,020
building site ake a construction site I

00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:47,700
know is literally how we thought of it

00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:53,190
in the early days right under construct

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:56,010
beautiful nostalgic effect this is under

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,810
construction that's it it's always under

00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,060
construction we just stop putting these

00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:02,400
animated gifts on our websites whatever

00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,980
is constantly under construction so I'm

00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,990
interested in in these metaphors we talk

00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,970
about ourselves on the web we talk about

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,580
our work now here's one that I hear a

00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:14,190
lot I'm talking about what we do and how

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,550
we borrow from another medium we talk

00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:20,220
about our work as though we are

00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:21,330
architects right everyone wants to be an

00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,980
architect which is funny because you

00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,980
actually talk to architects about the

00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,360
industry like it's terrible it's yes it

00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,160
dumpster fire like it's all about

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,970
competitions and prizes and

00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:35,400
a little spec work no but still anyone

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:38,670
wants to be like an architect I painted

00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,140
for this it's kind of become shorthand

00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:44,370
in screenplays that you know you want

00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:48,800
likeable person they're an architect is

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,800
never an architect in the movie

00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,760
architecture just as we can learn a lot

00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:55,380
from print I know many UX designers who

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,480
consider this book to be the best book

00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,660
they've ever read on UX design

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,250
it's not about UX design its 101 things

00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,630
I learned in architecture school by

00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,150
Mathew Frederick it is about

00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:08,370
architecture but a lot of the ideas and

00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:12,930
the messages are absolutely transferable

00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:14,490
to other mediums there's another book in

00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,200
architecture that's definitely had an

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,690
influence not just on the web but before

00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,490
the web on software in general that's a

00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:24,720
pattern language by Christopher

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:27,240
Alexander this is a classic book by

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:32,490
classic book I mean a book everyone's

00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:34,980
heard of and nobody's read it's 1977 and

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:36,750
it influenced people you know Ward

00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,220
Cunningham who invented the wiki he was

00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,470
influenced by a pattern language the

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,360
Gang of Four did design patterns

00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,100
elements of reusable object-oriented

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,240
software directly influenced by

00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,210
Christopher Alexander because he's

00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,990
talking about breaking things down into

00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:52,910
modular reusable components I mean come

00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,800
on that

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:59,240
Design Systems right so hot right now

00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,870
this absolutely resonates there was a

00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,649
book by Molly right Steenson

00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,480
intelligence where she specifically

00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:07,790
looks at the influence of product design

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,470
designers architects on the digital

00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,790
world and she points out that yeah

00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,410
Christopher Alexander has had a huge

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,899
influence in the digital world and

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,579
almost no influence in architecture like

00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:19,850
architects don't like him they think

00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:25,130
he's kind of preachy but in the web do

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:27,500
we ever like it components and patterns

00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:32,329
and design systems I did it for a couple

00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:36,410
years at patterns day and all these

00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:38,120
fantastic speakers we really should have

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,190
had a drinking game during the day which

00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,480
was a if someone mentioned a pattern

00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,269
language by Christopher Alexander you

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,370
take a drink because it was that

00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:48,430
prevalent here's the full drinking game

00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:51,019
I came up with was anytime someone says

00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:54,500
Christopher Alexander take a drink any

00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:55,819
time someone says Lego take a drink any

00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,189
time someone points out that naming

00:11:55,819 --> 00:12:00,110
things is hard take a drink

00:11:58,189 --> 00:12:02,209
anytime someone says atomic or atomic

00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:06,610
design take a drink and anytime someone

00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:06,610
says bootstrap you puke it all back up

00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:19,220
how building was learned by Stewart

00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:20,779
Brand again classic book 1994 was the TV

00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,579
series that went with it as well and in

00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:24,560
this book Stewart Brand looks at the

00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:27,589
work of a British architect named Frank

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,350
Duffy and Frank Duffy had this idea of

00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:34,069
buildings being not so much structures

00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:35,720
in space but layers of structure in time

00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:38,240
he talked about something called

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,689
shearing layers he's what he said was a

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,810
building properly conceived is several

00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:46,880
layers of longevity so he mapped out

00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,410
these layers these shearing layers right

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,029
you got you say think about the site

00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,759
that a building sits on you're talking

00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:54,319
about geological time scale and in the

00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:56,329
structure itself you hope the last four

00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:58,780
centuries and then you know the walls

00:12:56,329 --> 00:13:00,310
the plumbing the timescales get shorter

00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,660
you're talking about furniture inside a

00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:04,270
room that you can change at a daily

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,220
basis right so all these layers moving

00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:09,250
at different speeds

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,320
this is sheering layers so he's

00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,210
interested in the timescales here but I

00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,950
spotted something else about hearing

00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,990
layers which is that each layer depends

00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,000
on the layer before you can't have the

00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,830
structure until you have a site to build

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,180
on you can't move stuff around in a room

00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:25,390
until you've made the walls and the

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:28,000
doors right so this idea of each layer

00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,680
in the sheering layers depending on the

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,270
layer before it reminds me even

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,070
something I've come across in the work

00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:35,230
of Steven Johnson it's been a number of

00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:38,620
books about where good ideas come from

00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:40,930
and he keeps going back this idea of the

00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:43,330
adjacent possible that certain things

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:45,580
need to exist before you can create

00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:48,550
something right the adjacent possible he

00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:51,400
says is why you don't get the microwave

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:53,140
oven invented in you know medieval

00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:57,010
Europe there's too many other steps need

00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,880
to happen like there's so many steps

00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,620
that first you have to have

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,570
industrialization so we get to have

00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,490
electricity which leads to circuitry

00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,650
which leads to computer is the internet

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,330
you can keep going further right on top

00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:09,400
of this you build services like Facebook

00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,780
Google they depend on the web which

00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,350
depends on the internet depends on

00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:16,060
computers so these layers of you know

00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,860
stuff that's built up and again probably

00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,930
with the time skills too and they depend

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,690
on the layers below the adjacent

00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:25,210
possible and shearing layers now Stewart

00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:27,790
Brand revisits this idea of shearing

00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,450
layers in a later book the clock of the

00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,970
long now

00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:34,570
sister plants one of the cofounders of

00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:36,040
the long now foundation anybody heard of

00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,290
the long now foundation raise your hand

00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:42,000
any members of the long now foundation

00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:44,230
all right once there's a member great

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,840
long term thinking long now foundation

00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,790
long now org is the website if you'll

00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,620
notice that all there are years use five

00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:53,050
digits they begin with a leading zero

00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:58,150
you know I've got to avoid the white NK

00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:59,200
problem that will tell time for ten

00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,430
thousand years which is really

00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,350
fascinating a hundred when looking at

00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,060
design principles for something that

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:07,990
supposed to last for ten thousand years

00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:09,760
so in this book and responsibilities the

00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,920
idea is behind the world's slowest

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,920
computer

00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,820
Stuart brand kind of abstract shooting

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,440
airs from architecture and applies it to

00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:22,470
everything that Schilling layers are

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,420
just everywhere and he calls this pace

00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:27,660
layers this idea of just different

00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:30,300
layers of timescales and it gives an

00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:32,730
example by taking the human race and

00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:36,000
looking at the pace layers of the human

00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:38,130
race slowly and you've got our

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,899
physiological nature you know our DNA

00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,459
that doesn't change for tens of

00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:43,350
thousands of years physiologically does

00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:46,019
there's no difference between a you know

00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:48,209
Kailen and then astronaut culture builds

00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:50,310
up over centuries right how we identify

00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:52,139
as tribes with language with countries

00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:54,389
all this kind of stuff governments not

00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:56,190
government's govern and systems of

00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:57,959
governance they tend to stick around for

00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,510
quite a while but they can change maybe

00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:01,290
sometimes through revolution

00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,430
infrastructure needs to move faster than

00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:05,160
that but not too fast

00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:07,079
commerce very fast moving in fashion

00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,050
fashion moves really quickly so he maps

00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:11,850
these pace layers onto this diagram

00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,680
right well you got the really fast

00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:15,839
moving stuff up the top and the slow

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,010
moving stuff down the bottom when he

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,709
comes up fashion he's talking more stuff

00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:21,029
like pop music where everything supposed

00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:22,800
to change really quickly you know try

00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:25,529
this know try that what about this you

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,480
know that's good that it moves fast but

00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:29,790
it'll be really dull if fashion moved

00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,519
slowly right you wanted to and

00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:35,399
interestingly some stuff the good stuff

00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:38,130
and the fast layers will make its way

00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:41,060
down into the lower layers like a really

00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:43,740
good pop song may become part of culture

00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:45,750
so the way the Stewart Brand talks about

00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,660
the interactions between these fast

00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:52,560
layers and slow layers is he says fast

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:57,380
learns and slow remembers fast proposes

00:16:52,560 --> 00:17:01,050
and slow disposes fastest discontinuous

00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:03,630
slow is continuous and fast and small

00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:06,209
instructs slow and big by a crude

00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:09,990
innovation by occasional revolution but

00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:13,620
slow and big controls small and fast by

00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:16,770
constraint and constancy and he says

00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:21,179
fast gets all our attention but slow has

00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:22,740
all the power now this idea of pace

00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,760
layers I'm hopefully gonna be

00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,230
transferring from my brain into use

00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,910
I kind of feel that it's because the

00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,240
problem is I see paste layers everywhere

00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,130
now

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,440
you know like we a typographer points

00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:35,020
out bad kerning to you it's like thanks

00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,240
you've ruined my life now I can't only

00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:40,180
see that that's what it's like to paste

00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,830
layers for me like I just it's a joke at

00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,180
work if they left we will sell time to

00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,560
pay Slayers how long before somebody

00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,300
points out that this is like paste it

00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,580
it's like maybe the first time someone

00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:51,760
points out the arrow and the FedEx logo

00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:53,500
right that's all you see now FedEx truck

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,630
goes by will you see is the air you see

00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:59,380
you see in the air oh right yeah right

00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:01,990
yeah okay good okay what about this one

00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,140
what the Toblerone logo who sees the

00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,140
bear

00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:13,440
you see okay you won't be able to unsee

00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,440
that

00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:25,090
consider the duck a perfectly normal

00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:28,720
duck until you're on the internet and

00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:35,320
someone points out all Ducks are

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:40,330
actually wearing dog masks actually

00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:45,929
wearing dog masks and now when I show

00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:45,929
you the same picture of the same duck

00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,400
you cannot unsee that and that's what

00:18:49,630 --> 00:19:07,350
it's like with pay snares for me it's

00:18:51,400 --> 00:19:10,539
like you've got the Internet itself

00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:12,010
tcp/ip hasn't changed since you know Bob

00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:14,559
can have been Cerf basically wrote the

00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:15,940
protocols in 1974 and that feels right

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,100
we'd have to rip everything out and

00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,559
start from scratch

00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:22,390
HTTP protocol sit on top of tcp/ip right

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,679
we got protocols for email protocols for

00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:27,370
file transfer and protocols for

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:30,580
hypertext now HTTP has changed

00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:32,679
we've got 82 now but the pace of change

00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,750
tends to be pretty gradual it takes time

00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:37,299
and again that feels right it feels like

00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:39,970
it shouldn't move too quickly then we

00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:42,520
put URLs on the web

00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:45,669
if URLs were down here at the bottom

00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:47,830
layer URLs never change I wish that were

00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:50,110
the case we must acknowledge that URLs

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:51,730
absolutely change disappear they Rock

00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:54,010
but we can fight against the rock I

00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,630
think I think we should and what do you

00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,940
put at that URL

00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:00,130
the obvious answer did you put some

00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,809
hypertext with HTML right you got

00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,549
structured now HTML has changed I mean

00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:05,500
makes you know first created by Tim

00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:09,220
berners-lee borrowed all these tags from

00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:13,890
from sgml and was about 25 26 tags or

00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:13,890
elements as we would say today over 100

00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,020
with HTML the pace hasn't been too quick

00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,270
like I feel like I've been able to keep

00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,730
up with the pace of change with HTML and

00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:24,530
CSS I feel like it moves faster

00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:26,570
certainly these days there's more and

00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:28,310
more newer stuff coming in CSS which is

00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,440
great I mean now that we've got glued up

00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:33,710
creative flexbox and all the sort of

00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,480
stuff this is good I can keep on top of

00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,850
this you know follow the right blogs

00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,060
like keep track the right people and

00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:42,320
then there's the JavaScript ecosystem

00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:44,660
the language I'm talking about

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,480
javascript and friends right like the

00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:49,700
library is the the tools we use for

00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,110
JavaScript and this is like I give up

00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,390
it's too fast

00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:55,370
he's still using that light of so last

00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:58,240
week we've switched over to this I can't

00:20:55,370 --> 00:21:00,410
believe you're still using that to

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,700
anyone else feels like this when it

00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:04,160
comes to the pace of change with

00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,750
JavaScript now keep your hands up keep

00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:09,460
your hands up and just take a look

00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:16,940
around okay you're not you're not alone

00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:19,190
this apparently is the new normal slow

00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:24,650
remembers so it's kind of the point of

00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:27,200
JavaScript to go and over time the good

00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:29,240
stuff makes its way down consider you

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,250
know you know is first making things

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,200
with JavaScript showing my image now but

00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,690
the common uses were things like image

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,620
rollovers right you mouse over something

00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:40,970
the the image changes validations

00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,770
somebody's typing something into a form

00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:45,800
field is that actually an email address

00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:49,820
was that required field filled in I use

00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:52,310
JavaScript to do that how would you CSS

00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,560
to do a rollover call on hover I would

00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:57,110
use HTML input type equals email

00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:01,040
required to do form validation right

00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:02,930
fast learns slow remembers those things

00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,280
filter down you know we needed a

00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,930
solution for responsive images we

00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:10,850
figured out in JavaScript and then it

00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:14,450
moves down into HTML so mapping these

00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:16,400
things helps me with feeling overwhelmed

00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:18,410
by the pace of change in JavaScript

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,810
because I realized it's kind of supposed

00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:22,580
to be that way it's the tippity-top of

00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:23,990
the layers and it's meant to be trying

00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,430
not to new stuff and changing things

00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,800
quickly you know if I want to go

00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:29,290
somewhere that's a bit you know

00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:32,200
slow moving I can spend my time in one

00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:33,580
of those other layers so something else

00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,520
I noticed when I mapped this out like

00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:38,650
this it's like huh this is order of

00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,230
things this layered structure that's

00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:43,660
kind of how I build websites to write

00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,310
I've seen the presence of the internet

00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:49,030
on our service workers you can even get

00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:51,040
around that okay you design there's a

00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,750
place to start I think it's a great

00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,640
place to start designing something and

00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:57,040
then thinking about yours the structure

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,230
of your content with HTML before

00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,330
thinking about the presentation and then

00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:02,890
having JavaScript on top of that for the

00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,930
behavior and the really powerful stuff

00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:07,570
right

00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:11,950
this really maps to I'd like to build in

00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:13,870
layers it is a testament to the

00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,480
flexibility of the web that you don't

00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,820
have to build this way if you want to

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,450
you don't have to use all the layers you

00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:27,880
can if you wish don't like this you can

00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:32,620
assume the presence of the internet URLs

00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:34,240
routing JavaScript in the client if you

00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:37,270
I'm gonna put some text on a screen

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:40,570
yeah let's use JavaScript for that CSS

00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:43,150
in J's please and of course everything

00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:44,860
on top of that now this is nearly the

00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:49,150
architecture of single page apps right

00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:50,920
so you can use this architecture rather

00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,050
than using delayed architecture now

00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,370
personally I don't like this

00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:56,650
architecture it doesn't sit right with

00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:58,720
me I'll tell you why it because you've

00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,880
kind of turned it into this single point

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,220
of failure rather than you know

00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,590
gradients of failure where if you got

00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:07,420
JavaScript everything is great if you

00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:09,280
don't have JavaScript you get absolutely

00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:11,770
nothing so it turns it into a binary

00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,540
situation you did works great or it

00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:15,340
doesn't work I love people switching off

00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,930
JavaScript something happens on the

00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,940
network something happens in between and

00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:20,950
you get absolutely nothing now this way

00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,270
of thinking this binary way of thinking

00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,940
between something either doesn't work at

00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:27,940
all or or great makes total sense in

00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:30,880
other mediums if for example you're

00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:33,560
building a native app for a phone you're

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,490
building an iOS and I have an

00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:39,590
device great I get 100% of what you've

00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:41,180
designed a built it works great if

00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:44,180
you're building an iOS and I have an

00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:46,220
Android device I get zero percent of

00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,060
what you've designed and built it just

00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,220
doesn't work at all

00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:52,450
so mindset makes total sense in a lot of

00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:55,070
software situations but not on the web

00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:58,250
under where that is possible for us to

00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:59,330
build like this where you can build in

00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,710
layers so something goes from not

00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:02,300
working at all to just about work and

00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:04,460
working better it working really well to

00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,020
working great now you might design

00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,120
something and you're imagining it works

00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,400
100% and maybe because of the device I'm

00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,650
using on my browser or my network I

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,550
don't get 100% of what you've designed

00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:18,980
and built I probably won't get 0% they

00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:21,320
made it 80% may get 90% depending on the

00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,210
situation in the circumstances I feel

00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,970
like that's better than the binary

00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:28,490
situation what's really nice about this

00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:31,250
approach to building on the web is that

00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:34,010
it maps so well to the technologies we

00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:36,830
use for building on the web a layered

00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:38,450
approach now I'm not the only one if it

00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:42,590
thinks this way I'm gonna quote from

00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:45,920
Ethan Marcotte he says I like designing

00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:48,680
in layers I love looking at the design

00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,390
of a page a pattern whatever I'm

00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:53,000
thinking about how it'll change if say

00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:55,190
phones aren't available or JavaScript

00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,500
doesn't work or if someone doesn't see

00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:00,440
the design as you or I might and it's

00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,990
having the page read aloud to them it's

00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:05,510
just kind of anticipating the the

00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:07,940
unexpected ease and of course we all

00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:09,500
know from writing an article on our list

00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,970
apart this time I was back in 2010 it

00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,780
was called responsive web design you

00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,210
might have heard of it

00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,890
right what's interesting so same place

00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:19,010
where John also published his article in

00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:21,470
2000 and even begins his article by

00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:24,680
quoting John Alsop's article by building

00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:26,900
on top of it another layer if you will

00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:29,360
and this term that Ethan comes up with

00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:31,490
responsive web design it was borrowed

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,320
directly from architecture in

00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,850
architecture school thought called

00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,780
responsive design about buildings

00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:40,820
responding to the people within them so

00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:42,380
architecture actually a pretty rich

00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:45,410
scene for

00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:49,520
metaphors and language to describe our

00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:52,580
work there's another area of work that

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,510
we've we've taken from so that will do

00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,419
nicely very much

00:26:53,510 --> 00:27:01,730
and that's when we describe ourselves as

00:26:55,419 --> 00:27:03,919
engineers software engineers for the

00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:06,320
term software engineering not because

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:10,820
the words itself the metaphor but Coomer

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:12,410
comes from Hamilton she coined this term

00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:15,020
software engineering Margaret Hamilton

00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:16,490
wrote the code for the Apollo command

00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:19,400
module code that was then literally

00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:21,890
woven into the computers for the

00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,390
greatest endeavor that our species has

00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:26,990
ever been involved in I think like the

00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:30,470
perfect mixture of software hardware and

00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:32,690
human beings working together to get

00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:35,059
human beings onto the moon absolutely

00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:36,559
amazing by the way I should point

00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:39,380
something out about this particular

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,419
picture you're familiar with the selfie

00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:43,669
a kind of self portrait photography

00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:47,530
popular with the youth this is one of

00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:50,600
the few examples of an everyone else see

00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:53,600
it's Michael Collins Buzz Aldrin and

00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,549
every human being alive at the time the

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,289
only person not in the picture is Sark

00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:59,059
development and emails from Michael

00:27:57,289 --> 00:28:01,070
Collins taking pictures the only person

00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:04,760
who is not in this picture it is an

00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:06,110
everyone else see so engineering

00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,630
software you know I feel like if you're

00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:10,429
sending people to the moon yeah feel

00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,929
like engineering all kinds of

00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:13,490
engineering Chemical Engineering

00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:15,980
mechanical engineering Industrial

00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:18,770
Engineering that's genes you would what

00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,750
you need these various disciplines often

00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:22,730
that fall on it as engineering umbrella

00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:24,080
I think aspect that you've got

00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,270
why are you working with is the

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,429
materials what are you working with and

00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:30,530
the tools that you use to work with

00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:33,080
those materials so let's see if that can

00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:36,650
apply to the web well as we've seen I

00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:39,350
think the materials of the web are HTML

00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,710
CSS and JavaScript hopefully in that

00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,720
order

00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:43,700
and that's what the end users are going

00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,350
to get no matter what tool to use to

00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:48,890
build it that's that's ultimately what

00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:50,750
the end users will get now what tools

00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:52,549
you use to design and build on the web

00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,230
there's the obvious tools like graphic

00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:55,900
design tools you know the photo shops

00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,900
and the sketches yep

00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,730
graphic design tools just feel like

00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,840
graphic design tools can influence our

00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:04,419
thinking in much the same way as

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,890
political language can right like you

00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:07,210
open up a Photoshop document to make a

00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:09,100
new Photoshop document first thing you

00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:10,330
do is put in a width and a height the

00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,490
straightaway you're thinking in back in

00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:14,860
that killer website constrained way

00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:17,470
these are obvious tools to build with

00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:20,260
less obvious tools that we definitely

00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:21,909
use for working on a web project you

00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,010
know we have to communicate whether it's

00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:26,529
email or slack and calendars and

00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:28,210
meetings and all that stuff these are

00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:30,220
productivity tools though I know

00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:33,390
sometimes it feels like we are not being

00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:35,620
productive when we're using these tools

00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:38,020
oxymoron to say productivity tools

00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:40,059
because that's really what a tool is all

00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:43,809
tools are productivity tools that's what

00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:46,659
tools do acknowledge these are also

00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:49,539
tools that are necessary to build

00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:50,980
something and then let's deep this

00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:53,890
specifically what about when we're

00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,440
developing write designing communicating

00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,669
collaborating and then we go to develop

00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,390
there's a whole bunch of tools we can

00:29:57,669 --> 00:30:04,419
use version control and task learners

00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:08,470
build tools pipelines pre-processors

00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:09,970
post processors all these tools and all

00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:12,700
of these together because what they

00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:15,250
share in common is that they sit on your

00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,919
computer and they did productivity tools

00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,809
they're there to help you work faster

00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:22,240
the end user doesn't see any of that

00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:28,240
I didn't directly touch the end user you

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:29,470
can say directly so when it comes to

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,539
these things I feel like well because

00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,080
they sit on your computer use whatever

00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:34,960
you want

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,600
muse whatever makes sense to you or your

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,500
team like that that should be the

00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,890
defining factor

00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:46,059
I admit again like what the JavaScript

00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:47,890
ecosystem I'm a bit overwhelmed with the

00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:49,899
pace of change again if I call you're

00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:51,789
still using that particular task liner

00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:54,610
well we changed last week to this new

00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:55,960
one it feels like maybe sometimes I

00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:58,419
understand you working at scale you need

00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,919
these complicated tools but does it

00:30:58,419 --> 00:31:03,630
always have to be that way does it

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,630
always have to be so complicated

00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:08,759
is remember that startup that was like

00:31:06,749 --> 00:31:12,929
before bodega the Silicon Valley

00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:15,539
poster-child juicer oh right it was like

00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:17,460
a really expensive machine and I was you

00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:19,409
excuse and you'd buy the expensive

00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,940
machine nearby the expensive packets of

00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:22,859
juice and you put the expensive packets

00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:25,289
of juice into the Machine and you got

00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:27,119
two so supposed to do juice

00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:29,549
well somebody pointed out you could just

00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:32,759
squeeze the packet by hand

00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:38,190
I'm just saying you can't just squeeze

00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:39,840
the packet by hand like if you're just

00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:42,389
making juice for a few people you can

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,639
squeeze by hand if you have to scale to

00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:47,539
giving juice to thousands or millions of

00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:50,249
people across the globe then you need

00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:54,720
say this is where the four breaks down I

00:31:50,249 --> 00:31:57,539
think so I'm gonna leave that as one of

00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,039
the materials and the tools and you're

00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:00,899
saying if you choosing those kind of

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:03,090
tools right your task runners you

00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:05,460
minifiers whatever ya use whatever works

00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,720
for you that's fine there's a holes

00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,859
where that's not true and that's the

00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,139
tools that are actually written in the

00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:12,570
materials themselves so if you're using

00:32:10,139 --> 00:32:14,639
a CSS framework to make your life as a

00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,989
Productivity tool that's fine but now

00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:17,429
you're making the user download the

00:32:15,989 --> 00:32:18,720
framework so you're making a user

00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:20,429
download the framework so you the

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,999
developer get the benefit if you use a

00:32:20,429 --> 00:32:25,470
JavaScript framework and the client-side

00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:26,909
then you're making the user download the

00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,919
framework so you get the benefit they're

00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:30,480
paying the tax that's used on the server

00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:31,919
side then it goes back to being one of

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,559
those tools that's basically sitting on

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,359
your computer right just pointing I

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,830
think when it comes to the tools that

00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:39,269
are built in the materials frameworks

00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,409
and libraries built in the languages

00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:42,749
that are and those things that then

00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:44,700
delivered to the end-user you cannot

00:32:42,749 --> 00:32:46,499
just say hey use whatever works for you

00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,499
use whatever is best for you or your

00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:51,690
team I think you must consider the needs

00:32:49,499 --> 00:32:55,710
of the users over the needs of the

00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:58,320
engineers to be had there and I would

00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:02,159
rather wait the balance in terms of

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,989
users than engineers developer

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,440
experience as much as the next developer

00:33:03,989 --> 00:33:10,019
but user needs they've got to come first

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,059
now when you're choosing tools there's a

00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:13,830
lot of questions you can ask about is

00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:15,460
this an appropriate tool is this gonna

00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:17,410
help me

00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,940
and one thing to ask is well how well

00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:20,740
does it work that's the obvious question

00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:23,140
should I use this too how well does it

00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,280
work but something to ask especially if

00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:27,160
it's something that's going to be used

00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,870
that in it to directly impact the end

00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,850
user something the end user is going to

00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:32,920
have to download and a really important

00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:40,240
question to ask is not how well does it

00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:43,750
work how well does it fail what happens

00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,130
when things don't go perfectly and now

00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,330
we're back to that situation of the

00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,890
single point of failure because if

00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:49,720
you're building that binary way where

00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:50,500
it's like the internet and JavaScript

00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,880
and nothing else

00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:57,730
it fails really badly either works great

00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,370
or it doesn't work at all but this

00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:03,820
layered approach to building fails

00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:06,520
really well something does go wrong you

00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:08,650
know one of these within delaio itself

00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:15,490
you use some CSS that isn't 100%

00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:18,010
supported in every browser it's fine you

00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:20,410
some HTML isn't 100% supported that's

00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:23,470
absolutely fine these technologies fail

00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:25,900
well which brings us to something

00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:27,610
interesting so you know Java scripts the

00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,800
more powerful technology but it doesn't

00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:31,380
fail as well as HTML and CSS you make

00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,550
one mistake in one line of JavaScript

00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:36,310
everything after that won't get parsed

00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:38,770
right well this is kind of a good

00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:41,020
example of a principle a law of nature

00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:44,260
that was kind of underlying the creation

00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:46,990
of the web itself the principle of least

00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:49,140
power which states that you should

00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:52,090
choose the least powerful language

00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:54,010
suitable for a given purpose that seems

00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:56,110
a bit weird on the surface why would I

00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:57,910
choose the least powerful language to do

00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:59,470
something but when you think about it

00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:01,080
the least powerful language is also

00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:04,420
going to be probably more ubiquitous

00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:07,180
probably gonna last longer less prone to

00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:10,980
failure Derek Featherstone puts it this

00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:14,410
way in the web front-end stack HTML CSS

00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:16,750
JavaScript and Aria if you can solve a

00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:20,200
problem with a simpler solution lower in

00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:22,930
a stack you should it's not fragile it's

00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,820
more foolproof and just works actually

00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:25,960
starting up the resiliency of it yes you

00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,930
want to build a clickable button you

00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,700
could do that with JavaScript

00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:31,710
generative and then you've got to add

00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:34,280
the event handlers and put the Aria

00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:37,290
roles on it or just use a button

00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:39,119
alright the lazy solution is the better

00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,950
one that's a classic example of the

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,619
principle of least power I think this

00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:45,450
really matters on the web particularly

00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:47,609
what it runs straight into another law

00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:49,940
of nature that definitely applies on the

00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:53,309
world wide web and that is Murphy's Law

00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,030
anything that can possibly go wrong will

00:35:53,309 --> 00:35:57,359
go wrong

00:35:54,030 --> 00:36:00,210
Edward Aloysius Murphy jr. aerospace

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:04,020
engineer and because of this attitude no

00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:05,700
one ever died on his watch alright I

00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:09,119
think we're a bit quick to say

00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:10,619
everything will be fine right edge cases

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,960
I think you might have other industries

00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:14,609
did that you know car manufacturers they

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,319
strap crash-test dummies into cars and

00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:17,400
smash them against walls at high speed

00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:18,930
admittedly

00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,430
you know initially they didn't have to

00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:22,430
be regulation to make them do it but

00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:26,450
still they're considering these

00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:28,710
situations trying to make things safer

00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:30,900
if you might have been hey we've been

00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:33,089
looking at the data and we're gonna stop

00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,680
strapping crash-test dummies into cars

00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:36,900
and smashing against walls at high speed

00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:39,030
turns out most of these cars are being

00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,700
driven by humans not crash test dummies

00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:43,290
and this will be driven on roads I'm not

00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,750
being smashed into walls at high speed

00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:47,700
like yes of course that's the that's the

00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:49,170
happy path that's the situation we hope

00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:52,170
for but you hope for the best and you

00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:54,329
prepare for the worst and we are not

00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:58,170
preparing for the worst

00:36:54,329 --> 00:37:01,140
edge case here's what Trent Walton says

00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:04,079
he says like cars designed to perform an

00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:06,750
extreme heat or on icy roads websites

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,950
should be built to face the reality of

00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:13,799
the web's inherent variability the

00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:17,309
reality of the web's inherent

00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:20,210
variability it's exactly what John Alsop

00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:21,900
was talking about nineteen years ago

00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:24,150
whenever there's discussion of

00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:28,619
engineering something always comes up as

00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:31,049
bridges it's it's a metaphor but I'm

00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:34,980
gonna use it I'm gonna talk about a

00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:38,020
particular bridge this is the Quebec

00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:40,030
bridge cantilever bridge

00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,940
instructor started in 1904 after there

00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:44,020
was an architecture competition

00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,430
Theodore Cooper was the engineer in

00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,050
charge of the firm that won that

00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:49,150
particular competition and when the

00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:51,610
first things he did was he lengthened

00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:54,390
the bridge from four hundred and ninety

00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:56,260
meters to five hundred and fifty meters

00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:58,270
missing as he wants to be longer than

00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:01,060
the first bridge right to be like the

00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:03,790
longest bridge in the world but he

00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:07,210
didn't recalculate the already high

00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:09,190
stresses being put on the steel also a

00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:11,860
theater Cooper wasn't based in Quebec he

00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:15,670
was based in New York and he refused to

00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:17,740
work on-site an idea was people could

00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,640
double check his numbers he really

00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:21,430
didn't like that

00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:24,580
there will be no code reviews on this

00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:28,360
project so construct is happening that's

00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:30,370
1907 and August 6 the young engineer

00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:33,700
norman McClure he noticed that there's

00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:35,680
this bending is starting to happen he

00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:42,670
sees it again on the 27th of August and

00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:45,580
it's gotten worse he sent a telegram

00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:48,600
back that says place no more load on

00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:52,890
Quebec bridge until all facts considered

00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:54,700
he didn't explicitly say stop working so

00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:58,630
they didn't know how to interpret this

00:38:54,700 --> 00:39:00,760
telegram and they kept on working and it

00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:02,440
was day or two later it was was right

00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,740
before the end of work like the whistle

00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:12,960
was just about to blow when the bridge

00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:12,960
collapsed and 75 of the 86 workers died

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:20,020
something interesting happening in

00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:23,290
Canada years later it's 1925 and

00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:25,870
Canadian engineering schools started

00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:27,760
holding a new private ceremony this is

00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:30,550
separate from your qualifications and

00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,910
getting your degree this was the ritual

00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:37,540
of the calling of the engineer you'd

00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:41,200
speak an obligation and you'll be given

00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:47,140
an iron ring a symbol a metaphor of

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:49,340
pride yes but also humility you know the

00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:51,350
little finger of your working hand

00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:54,050
so it would you don't brush against the

00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:58,970
paper or the keyboard and there's a

00:39:54,050 --> 00:40:00,740
constant reminder of responsibility and

00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:05,330
that's why I take issue with us just

00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:10,760
deciding to call ourselves engineers we

00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:13,540
haven't earned it so how do we call

00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:18,410
ourselves architects engineers

00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:19,850
developers not bad I think maybe we got

00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:21,830
it right back in the Geo cities days

00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:24,020
when we just talked about building

00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:26,480
things yeah

00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:30,590
put builders we're just like working

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:33,950
bricklaying together to make things I

00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:36,770
mean is that so bad that we work

00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:39,170
together and we build maybe it's not

00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:41,690
engineering maybe it's not architecture

00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:43,490
but Christopher Alexander did say this

00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:45,200
influence is thinking he said most of

00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:50,380
the wonderful places of the world were

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:53,090
not made by architects but by the people

00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:55,100
I don't mind thinking of myself as a

00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:57,410
bricklayer no one we've got such amazing

00:40:55,100 --> 00:41:00,350
bricks to work with right yes it's a

00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:03,710
metaphor again but think about the web

00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:06,530
hypertext link I mean what an amazing

00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:09,620
brick the link is right I can make a

00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:11,090
page at a URL and I can link to another

00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:13,790
URL

00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:16,250
I'm simply URL over there I mean that

00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:19,910
combination of links has never existed

00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:22,540
before in the history of the web that's

00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:26,390
an amazing thing it's kind of magical I

00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:27,860
think we forget the magic I honestly

00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:29,000
think it is the next step in our

00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,040
civilization that we've gone from

00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,360
language and then writing and the

00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:38,120
printing press to the world wide web and

00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:42,710
hypertext that it's the next layer on

00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:46,430
top of all those layers and that we can

00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:49,190
choose to build amazing things official

00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:51,560
is the apocryphal story you know about a

00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:53,780
traveler the older days comes across

00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,890
three workmen who are you know putting

00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,930
stones want to talk to you out of

00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:58,370
building something this is to the first

00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:59,630
worker what what are you what are you

00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:02,330
doing there

00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:04,090
I'm you know putting stones stacking

00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:07,010
stones okay

00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:09,110
bricks sister the second marker what are

00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:10,550
you doing I'm making a wall they're all

00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,400
doing the same thing right but they give

00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:15,500
different answers I'm making a wall

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,720
stacking bricks he says to the third

00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:21,350
builders what are you doing because I'm

00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,910
making a Cathedral so maybe you know

00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:25,490
it's less about how we describe

00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:29,750
ourselves what language we use much more

00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:32,390
about what we build together we are

00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:35,210
bricklayers and over the last two days

00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:38,510
you've heard from some amazing

00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:44,300
bricklayers people who are building

00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:48,080
websites businesses building communities

00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:50,210
building the web what an honor and a

00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:53,870
privilege to be involved in the

00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:55,790
construction of the web after two days

00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:58,730
of hearing from these bricklayers my

00:42:55,790 --> 00:43:00,800
mind is full I feel like we need to stop

00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:02,690
now so I'm gonna stop moving my job up

00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,490
and down and slapping the fleshy piece

00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:07,670
of meat in my mouth and moving the air

00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:09,940
of my vocal cords and simply say thank

00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:09,940
you

00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:15,110
