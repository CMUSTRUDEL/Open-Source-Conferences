As the owners of web performance, my team is often asked some version of the question “Is the site fast yet?”. While it sounds simple, it's actually impossible to answer without asking more questions. “Is our site fast in New York but slow in Sydney? Is it fast on all devices or just on desktop? How fast is fast enough and most importantly, what does fast even mean?”. In this talk, I’ll share what we've learned while finding an answer to this question, including how to conduct a performance audit, how to talk about performance with your teammates outside of engineering, and how to advocate for your users by making performance a priority.

hello everyone I'm really excited to be

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,269
here and I'm really excited to speak to

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,059
you all about performance to just come

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,320
up quite a bit today and it's exciting

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,439
to be with a bunch of other people who

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,609
are excited about performance and

00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:23,670
specifically what I want to talk to you

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,760
all about is how am i interested in web

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,480
performance and specifically how I've

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,800
got about trying to answer almost

00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,190
impossible questions to answer like is

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:39,809
the site fast yet and maybe together we

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:42,149
can get an answer for that and so it all

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:44,250
started when I started working at my

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,840
current company that I work at now to

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,410
tie my three-year anniversary they're

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,050
just really exciting globally and we're

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,660
based in New York City and we're called

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,270
teachers pay teachers or TBT for short

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,489
and we're an educational community and

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,140
marketplace where teachers house tours

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,449
on our site where they can share and

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,909
sell resources that they create to other

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,920
teachers and I was really excited to

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,350
start working at TVT as a software

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,729
engineer my mom's a teacher when I

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,830
explore I was interviewing there she was

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,320
like I use it all the time and I was

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,090
really excited to work on a product

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,670
where I felt like I could use my tech

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,710
skills to make a real impact in people's

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,070
lives especially for teachers who work

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,869
so hard this is a picture of team TPT I

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,909
think a little bit after I enjoyed we've

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:36,000
grown quite a bit since then and this is

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,549
a very posed picture humanity made on

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,310
the team I worked on but I really loved

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,200
how collaborative it was and I started

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,500
out as a product engineer on the search

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,360
and discovery team and so on TPT I think

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,509
now we have over four million resources

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,280
on our site so part of the objective of

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,320
our team was to figure out how do we

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,110
deliver the right resource at the right

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,140
time to the right teacher and I

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,119
specifically was working mostly at the

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,190
front of engineer and this is my second

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,950
engineering job so

00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:09,410
really excited to dig into owning a

00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,480
bigger project this is what the site

00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:15,350
looked like when I joined it in 2016

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,870
which was interesting and I was really

00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:22,400
excited to work on a new project to

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:24,140
bring it into a modern-day design but we

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,160
didn't want to change too much about how

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,510
it actually functioned this is for a few

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,920
reasons we first wanted to take an

00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,290
approach to moving into a completely

00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,060
different stack as well that they had

00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,560
decided on I think finalized look the

00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,360
weekend I got there I thought I was

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,330
gonna be working on a PHP monolith

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,250
legacy site and ended up we were going

00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,140
to rebuild something where I'd be

00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,090
working on no doubt that called out to

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,910
an elixir graph API was is really

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:52,130
exciting and working with Reax so my

00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:54,590
first project was working on the front

00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:58,100
end of that my teammates to rebuild this

00:02:54,590 --> 00:03:00,170
and in addition to learning our new tech

00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,360
spec it involved figuring out what are

00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:05,150
all the different pieces of this page

00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,040
and not only the visual pieces you see

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,200
but how does filtering work what

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,690
tracking do we have on the page and how

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,850
do we want to rebuild all of that and so

00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,130
it's not really good about where we were

00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,600
after working super collaboratively with

00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,790
the team this is what it looks like now

00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,480
spoiler alert that we launched it but

00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:25,820
before we launched there was a problem I

00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,760
thought we were all future ready to go

00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:31,310
but it turns out that even though the

00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,130
legacy code base was a little difficult

00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:37,040
for developers to work in it was very

00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:39,739
fast and it turns up the new search page

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,800
we had built was much slower and that

00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:45,200
was collage bloggers so you can imagine

00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,060
I was a little nervous about this didn't

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,670
really know what to do but knew we had

00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,650
to work collaboratively so one thing I

00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:54,890
really loved about the structure of our

00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:57,680
engineering team is that we have product

00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:59,720
engineers but then we also have platform

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,459
engineers so like I said I was working

00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,989
on a search discovery product team

00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:05,900
product engineers are working on a

00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:09,000
specific part of the site but then we

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:12,150
have platform engineers and so I

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,610
with our web platform team to figure out

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,769
how can we update our text stack and

00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:19,650
look look into this problem so that we

00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:22,440
would be unblocked for lunch and it

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,850
turns out that this was so much to me

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,040
that I actually ended up switching to

00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:28,050
that team because I really enjoyed those

00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,420
problems and now the tech lead and

00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:35,070
hinder for that team which is very

00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:37,050
exciting and so we answer a lot of

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,360
questions generally about a friend

00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,190
things that TPT but today I'm going to

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,660
be talking about some and make those

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,250
questions that can be hard to answer

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,800
that we get specifically about

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,560
performance so imagine you have an

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,419
anxious engineering like me back when I

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,370
was trying to help my team loves the

00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:55,320
page and they come to you and they say

00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,780
we're really trying to launch a new

00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,810
feature but it's too slow what should we

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:03,150
do I definitely want to help out this

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:08,130
anxious engineer let's see what we can

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:09,870
do or you might have a frustrated user

00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,270
maybe this is somebody who wrote in to

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,460
our customer experience team saying

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,800
something to the effect of the home page

00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,780
seems slower than usual is something

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,710
wrong

00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,479
if you've ever been on the other side

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,830
I'm trying to answer these questions you

00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:31,020
can be like oh that's not enough

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:32,880
information I have no idea um you can

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,770
also imagine that once you tell people

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,320
you're working on something like web

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,040
performance things that might come up in

00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,400
the kitchen

00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,780
or in various meetings might be so

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,600
you're working on web performance like

00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:48,600
it's the same fast yeah which is also a

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,300
really hard question to answer but I

00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,520
didn't realize until I was the person

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,080
being asked these questions also as I

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,540
started to work on web performance with

00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,280
my team we had to think about hey we're

00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,819
doing all this work like what are we

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,879
actually trying to gain and where we try

00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:09,050
so I want to get some answers for all of

00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:11,209
our various users and I really love

00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,679
mysteries and before I was a software

00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:14,959
engineer and did a lot of scientific

00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:18,800
research but I love these like ambiguous

00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:21,469
hard to solve problems and my favorite

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,569
way of getting closer to solving a

00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:27,050
really hard question is to ask some

00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:29,119
follow-up questions so for this talk I

00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:32,809
want us to put our detective hats on and

00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:35,689
to ask five follow-up questions that can

00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:37,369
get you closer to an answer about how we

00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:38,929
can learn more about the performance of

00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:41,990
our current site and what it means for

00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:43,999
whatever you're working on and also how

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,499
this has to do a lot with communication

00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:46,879
and with really being aligned with

00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:50,389
different stakeholders and whatever

00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:54,740
you're building so we'll go through

00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:57,469
first why do we care what is fast even

00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:01,429
mean I've been using that term a lot how

00:06:57,469 --> 00:07:04,489
do we measure performance how fast is

00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:06,699
fast enough and then if we're feeling

00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:09,529
good how do we make sure it stays fast

00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:11,119
so let's go ahead let's hopefully by the

00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,499
time we finish these questions we can

00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:16,009
have some answers for an anxious

00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:18,589
engineer or frustrated user so the first

00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:21,289
one is why do we even care at the site

00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:24,709
as fast and I'll first mention that

00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:26,569
maybe we don't and that's a valid answer

00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:28,939
but I think even taking time to think

00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:31,599
about that is a step in the right

00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:34,399
direction activity we don't have a

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,469
specific performance team like my team

00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,969
has that in addition to a bunch of other

00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:39,319
things to work on so it can be really

00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:41,689
really hard to figure out when to

00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,519
prioritize performance and imagine if

00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:45,919
you have smaller teams it's even harder

00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,679
and there could be use cases where you

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,149
have to make trade-offs I think there

00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:52,729
are some use cases where maybe you're

00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:54,259
experimenting with something you just

00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:55,969
want to kind of see what it looks like

00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:58,339
you're gonna throw out the code or

00:07:55,969 --> 00:07:59,839
something and you don't want to worry

00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:02,689
about performance but at least you made

00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:05,929
an explicit decision or maybe you're

00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:07,099
prototyping something and again it

00:08:05,929 --> 00:08:07,980
doesn't really make sense for your

00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:09,900
specific use case

00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,220
though I will say I would caution

00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,390
against thinking that any

00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,830
experimentation

00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,450
you should have think about performance

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:18,450
in the beginning because it's much

00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:20,010
easier to think about it have a baseline

00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,480
for thinking about performance when

00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:24,150
you're getting started rather than going

00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,890
back at the end so I don't more people

00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:28,830
about this but did want to call it out

00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:33,300
but let's say in almost all cases you

00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:36,060
are concerned about performance and so

00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:38,010
what is really helpful for us is for to

00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:41,880
think about how this performance affects

00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:45,630
our users like I said TPT is a site for

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,190
educators and everyone is really on

00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,350
board with our mission which is why I

00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,720
love working there empowering educators

00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,910
to teach of their best so when we talk

00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,070
about performance I like to get everyone

00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,750
bought in by figuring out like how can

00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:03,300
we align that really critically to our

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:05,280
mission so if the websites lower you can

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,320
imagine that cause a lot will cause a

00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,150
lot of stress or frustration for

00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,310
teachers where I have a really stressful

00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,530
job and I definitely don't want to do

00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:17,700
that and that's definitely not spurring

00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:20,820
our mission also like I mentioned my

00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,130
team's mission was to find their

00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,490
teachers the right resource at the right

00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:28,830
time and if we are making a fast website

00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:32,010
that's literally saving teachers time

00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:33,810
and so this is a really powerful way to

00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,580
get people bought into what we should

00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,970
even think about what performance so I

00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,250
would encourage you to think about what

00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,390
how you might do that for whatever

00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:46,520
products you're working on or whatever

00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:49,260
tech you're working on as well okay so

00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:53,270
we figured up that would care about

00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:55,620
performance but what is fast even mean

00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:57,300
this was really hard to explain to

00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,090
people who kind of wanted like a yes or

00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,250
no answer when they asked me about site

00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:05,550
performance or like give me a number

00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:07,500
like in seconds and I was like oh it's

00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,410
not possible but I can give you some

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,610
various answers but I think first it's

00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,680
in we're into a lot

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,600
what we actually want to measure

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,339
together and again I don't think that

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,560
should just be the job of engineers or

00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:21,209
people who are engineers working on

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,130
performance I think this is really

00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:25,230
collaborative it could be with other

00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:27,029
people in marketing or also in product

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,519
various designers I worked with a lot of

00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:32,730
people on aligning on what these metrics

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,880
are like and this involved identifying

00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:38,490
key metrics that for our organization

00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,950
that made sense we decided it was

00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,200
important for us to look at metrics that

00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:46,200
other that are like industry standards

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:50,430
as well speed index so we could

00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:53,100
understand the average time way things

00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:55,019
were displaying on our page time to

00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,980
first byte we wanted to get measurement

00:10:55,019 --> 00:11:00,540
on also responses from the API calls

00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,010
that were being called on the page so

00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,950
that we can have an understanding of

00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:07,890
what was contributing to our timings

00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:10,529
across various pages also identifying

00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:13,829
what those key pages are the search page

00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:15,450
is one page but depending on what your

00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:18,149
search query is where you're filtering

00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:21,449
is it can be an infinite amount of pages

00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:23,120
so how do you test that what metrics are

00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:26,940
important for you this was an ongoing

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,850
conversation and what was really helpful

00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,589
was the communication aspect of this so

00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,600
there's lots of documentation out there

00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:35,130
that we would link and was awesome and

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,290
sometimes that was enough to send to

00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:39,839
other engineers but maybe it's more

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:43,260
impactful to show a designer or product

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,329
person the film scripts and of your site

00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,980
loading and how that I actually will

00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,360
appear to the user depending on what

00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,180
device you're on or different

00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:55,290
connectivity or speeds and so I think

00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:56,820
aligning your metrics to actually what

00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:01,589
other people might care about was

00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:03,420
actually very critical as well as since

00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:04,100
we talked about why you got everyone

00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,779
bought it on

00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:09,709
performance let's go ahead and also

00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:12,829
connect those metrics to that so for

00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:14,120
example for the search page we know we

00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:15,290
really want teachers to be able to

00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,290
interact with the page is probably

00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:20,480
important that we keep track of

00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:22,459
Metroplex time to interactive so this

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,410
was a really good example to get us all

00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:26,000
aligned on what fast means and even

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,940
though I couldn't get like a one-word

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,459
answer this was really a great way to

00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:36,410
get on the same page okay we have our

00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:39,620
foundations so like really how fast to

00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:42,589
say let's get some more concrete answers

00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:45,230
and the way we've got about this is by

00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:47,720
conducting performance audits so I'll

00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,600
use the example of the search page

00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,860
before to get we've done a few of those

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,050
moving over to learning stock which has

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,240
been really exciting and performance

00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,190
audits have been a way for us all to get

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,949
aligned and work on it collaboratively

00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:03,259
and we've used various toolings that

00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:06,769
we've decided to use at CBT to get like

00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:09,589
a whole overview picture of what we want

00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:11,870
to measure so we've used tools like like

00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:15,350
house we use tools like speed curve that

00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:17,420
bring in data from webpagetest and like

00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:19,699
house also but also make great graphs

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:22,399
that we can show to people outside of

00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:26,449
engineering too that are clear we've

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:28,370
also used a cap point where we could run

00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:32,000
synthetic monitoring tests across

00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:33,740
various nodes throughout the world and

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,029
all of these have given us a better

00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:40,670
picture of what the current page or

00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:42,949
feature that we're trying to work on is

00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:45,019
like right now and then also help us

00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:47,329
figure out like as we make our changes

00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:49,519
can we test that as well and compare

00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:50,810
them and then that could give us a

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,980
better understanding of where we're

00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:57,380
trying to go and what I really learned

00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,320
from doing this exercise speaking of

00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,580
testing on multiple browsers

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,070
this is really important for performance

00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:06,190
and also for us to take into account

00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:09,220
like what type of browsers teachers

00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:12,670
might use and who use of our website are

00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,500
they on their school Wi-Fi what types of

00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:16,720
devices are they using they probably are

00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:20,530
not using the same types of devices that

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,690
have the same power as we do so it's

00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,970
really important to test in different

00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:27,790
ways and so we used a lot of synthetic

00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:29,080
testing for this as well and also it

00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:32,110
helped us to make decisions for example

00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:35,560
we were doing a homepage port we decided

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:38,800
to launch and work incrementally so we

00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,750
first launched a lot at home page that

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,280
we felt good about on desktop knew we

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,190
still needed to do work on performance

00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,660
for mobile and doing a performance

00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:50,350
product really to help us think about

00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:52,720
those trade-offs and I mentioned catch

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:56,200
point but that's been a really cool tool

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,650
for us for availability and performance

00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,270
monitoring because we're able to see run

00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:04,990
synthetic tests from different nodes

00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:07,120
across the world and so TPT's used I

00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,710
think by the new number seventy percent

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,880
of teachers have downloaded a resource

00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:14,500
from us in the US but we also have users

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,570
who use us outside of the US and

00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,580
important for us to understand what

00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:20,560
their performance experiences like as

00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:23,400
well so this was something we wanted to

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,350
do as well and our performance on it and

00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:30,490
that helped us get a good sense of how

00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:35,260
fast is the same but so you've done this

00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:37,540
work you collected some metrics and from

00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,910
those metrics then you've taken the

00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:43,570
steps to figure out what you might want

00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:46,420
to try maybe you realized okay we could

00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:49,690
we're loading to large images let's work

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,520
on that or we want to wait less spots on

00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:54,250
mobile let's try that and see how that

00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:57,810
affects metrics or somebody else to go

00:15:54,250 --> 00:16:00,490
and figure out what we can lazy load in

00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:02,020
so what everyone's working on that I

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:05,170
would suggest the first

00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:08,050
is just the lining on how like what are

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:09,880
you working to it so how fast is fast

00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:14,649
enough you could kind of work on

00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:17,350
performance forever so again I'm really

00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:19,240
into collaboration I think this is

00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:22,510
really important to work with product on

00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:25,320
to define success my team can help

00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:28,690
inform that but we don't know

00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,370
specifically about each products need

00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,560
and their roadmaps so we like to work

00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:35,260
collaboratively with them to figure out

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,790
what are you trying to optimize for and

00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,130
how can we help you get the right

00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:40,839
information to do that and then also as

00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,560
we make changes we want to get you

00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:43,360
unblocked

00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,050
as soon as possible so you can start

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,209
meeting your goals so how can we do that

00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:51,760
something I really encourage is a bee

00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:53,080
testing performance changes I like this

00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,690
for several reasons

00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,910
I just love testing maybe also from my

00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:00,670
science background but it gives you a

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,560
better sense of are the changes you're

00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:05,500
making actually doing what you think

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,079
they're want to do and this is also a

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,179
great way to tie other user metrics you

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,730
might care about to performance changes

00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:14,740
and having this historical data makes it

00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:17,410
way easier to advocate for making

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,000
performance changes in the future so you

00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:21,130
can say hey remember that test we ran

00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,350
where we made really improve the speed

00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:26,290
index and I also changed like maybe the

00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:29,740
click-through rate then you can say

00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:31,900
let's take time to do that again if

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:36,150
that's going to help your users and home

00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:40,300
impacts the metrics that you care about

00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:43,090
also you can set some benchmarks so this

00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,980
can be against comparable pages so for

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,929
example for that search page we were

00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,300
saying the old site's

00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:52,300
pretty good we felt good about the speed

00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,450
let's say we're aiming for that or and

00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,780
can

00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:59,500
look at a competitor and say okay maybe

00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:02,270
we want to be as fast as this other

00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:04,940
e-commerce site let's look at some

00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:07,130
metrics there that's comparable or maybe

00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,020
it's dependent on your tech stack maybe

00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,360
you have different expectations for

00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:14,000
mobile and desktop so setting these

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,320
benchmarks ahead of time will make it

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,630
feel like you're actually working

00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,880
towards a goal as you make all of these

00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:25,610
performance changes which is really

00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:28,059
important so last question maybe you've

00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,559
done this you made all of your changes

00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:33,500
you're feeling good you feel like you

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:37,040
have more information on performance so

00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:39,320
how do we make sure that stays best I've

00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:42,250
seen that you know what code change can

00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:45,620
take all the hard work you've done and

00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:47,000
completely degrade the performance so

00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:52,340
how do we make sure that that doesn't

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,260
happen and I would really encourage all

00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,210
of you to think of performance as a

00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:58,040
product requirement that would have

00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:00,919
helped me a lot and saves a lot of

00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:03,380
stress and we have thought about that as

00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:05,929
critically as other product requirements

00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,820
of poring over the search page and this

00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:10,250
is a lesson I definitely expect the

00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:15,490
heart and I think it's just important I

00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:18,500
like to think of performance as as

00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:21,590
something that we can help other teams

00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,600
learn more about so my team likes to

00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:26,090
think about what tooling can we have in

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,400
place to help others make informed

00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:32,000
decisions so it does not to just be

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,730
tooling we've taken time to take all of

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,250
these performance on it and something

00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,950
that we've done is making sure that we

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:42,260
are very clear on what audience

00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:43,820
therefore usually it's for quite a few

00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,860
different audiences so something that's

00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:49,850
been really helpful is we put all the

00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:52,040
details at the bottom for what somebody

00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:54,559
might want to look at and at the top put

00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:57,950
a summary also like I said those

00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:01,170
definitions to all of the metrics is

00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:03,270
really helpful but some others

00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:05,940
we have it in places our first step was

00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:08,820
saying how can we let engineers know if

00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:11,820
their product made think of their deploy

00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,590
or change made something slower then

00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,780
even better than that how can we make

00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:18,150
sure maybe in their PR to get some

00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,710
information about how their changes

00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:23,010
might affect performance we have done

00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:25,590
this by showing people how their change

00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:29,280
affects the size of the JavaScript that

00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:32,580
we'll be sending or have been better how

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,220
can we help people think locally as they

00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,930
start making changes about how what

00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:40,020
they're doing will affect performance

00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:41,700
later on and all of this tooling I we

00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:46,620
want to put in place just to make it as

00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:48,360
easy as possible to not degrade and like

00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,640
I said I think this is all about making

00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,320
balanced trade-offs there's so many

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,390
things we want to do to work on

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,640
performance at my company and we don't

00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,470
have as much time and sometimes it can

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,990
feel like when you add monitoring that

00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:02,700
you just introduced a whole new set of

00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:05,370
problems that you didn't know existed

00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,810
before and you kind of wish you could go

00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:10,470
back to what you didn't know about them

00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:13,080
but like I said I like mysteries and I

00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,240
have found it actually really great that

00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,980
we now know these things that are

00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,780
probably affecting users that we didn't

00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:21,270
know about before and now we can take

00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:23,340
action even if it's small action or

00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:26,250
small steps to making it better and

00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:31,230
every time we do that we are supporting

00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:32,190
our mission of helping educators and so

00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,510
like I said something that's been

00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,040
helpful has been like how can we

00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:37,440
automate this process as much as

00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,090
possible something my team does from

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,330
catch point you're able to send like a

00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:44,700
report of the last week of data and also

00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:46,770
the last four weeks of data while some

00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,540
changes are like a London we clear that

00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:51,570
it's gotten slower after one deploy

00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:55,230
we've also seen performance changes that

00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:55,660
get slowly worse over time and so it

00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,370
doesn't

00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,170
know that notice until like two weeks of

00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:01,300
looking at like four weeks of data and

00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:03,160
then we can dig into it so having these

00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,680
reports automated and sent to us an

00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:09,430
email or a slap when we stop looking at

00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:15,040
our emails it's been a great way for us

00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:19,960
to be more aware of keeping our site

00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:22,210
fast and also high quality okay so we've

00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,760
made it through all of the questions you

00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:27,430
can take our detective hat off and let's

00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,830
see if we can help anxious engineer by

00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:32,200
going through some of these questions

00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:34,860
with them so reminder they're trying to

00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:38,470
launch a new feature but it's too slow

00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:40,570
what should they do so let's think about

00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:43,420
why do we care about performance in this

00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:47,530
case so in this case we want to deliver

00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:50,560
an equal or better user experience than

00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:52,570
teachers are already finding resources

00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,670
of success on our site we don't want

00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,780
switching to a new stack to effect that

00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:58,660
in any way negatively

00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:00,640
okay so we're aligned on that now let's

00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,610
align on what does fast even mean I

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,160
mentioned before we have some metrics

00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:10,630
that we knew were important to us speed

00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:13,000
index time interactive time the first

00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:16,540
bite and for responses and also

00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,460
measuring our different API response

00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:20,770
times cool

00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,780
so we're also a lot on that we then did

00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:26,980
a performance audit to figure out where

00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:29,380
the goal page was really good and where

00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,480
we were currently with our new product

00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:35,050
that we wanted to launch and then we

00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,880
were able to look into what changes

00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:38,920
could we make and that was a lot of

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,990
brainstorming and figuring out using a

00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:44,710
lot of the speed schooling that you will

00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:47,020
hear about to figure out what changes we

00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:49,510
can make but we also aligned on from the

00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:52,060
beginning where we were trying to go so

00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:54,430
we knew we wanted to be ok we'll feel

00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:56,130
good about launching when it's just as

00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:59,580
fast as the old one

00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:02,040
comprable and we got to that place after

00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,690
a lot of work which is awesome and then

00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,460
we're able to launch and then we did our

00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:08,190
fifth step of making sure we had

00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:10,290
monitoring and of the performance of the

00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:14,430
page for later so that we can keep track

00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:16,980
of this and not have to do a full audit

00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:20,580
like this in the future of this specific

00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:23,490
use case so going through all of that

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:27,510
well it wasn't again just an easy answer

00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:30,360
we helped anxious engineer okay and feel

00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:33,210
really supported which is always really

00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:36,540
great and one of the my favorite parts

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:39,330
of my job all right let's see if we can

00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:41,280
also help frustrated user when they say

00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:44,130
the home page seems slower than usual is

00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:47,250
something wrong so we care about this

00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:50,940
because our users are frustrated that's

00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:53,880
not how I guess what we want to do also

00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:56,700
let's think about teams slower than

00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,220
usual so it seems like it felt ok before

00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,380
but is there a timeline when this happen

00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:04,170
are is this the only user complaining

00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:06,450
about this or are other people can we

00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:08,750
reproduce those it also seems slow do we

00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,980
have monitoring in place that shows

00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,630
anything around the different metrics

00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,610
that we think are important what about

00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:17,700
the page scheme slower image is not

00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:20,280
loading in are you not seeing certain

00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:23,370
content or this new context should not

00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:25,020
show I'll show up out for a while so

00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:27,000
getting more information about that can

00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:29,070
help us dig into where we might want to

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,680
make changes and if it turns out that

00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:35,040
the home page is slower let's agree to

00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:37,470
figure out like how many changes we want

00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,710
to make and we can allocate resources to

00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:42,780
that because like I said if performance

00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:47,190
as a product requirement it should be

00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:48,480
way easier to prioritize then let's say

00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:52,050
something was wrong and you're able to

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,300
fix it that's really great for your user

00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:57,990
and also the monitoring you've had in

00:25:54,300 --> 00:26:01,110
place hopefully helped you get an answer

00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:04,560
very quickly and now this user can go

00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:05,470
back to teaching and getting all of the

00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:10,419
resources

00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:13,630
they want it so it also helps them so we

00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:17,110
still have this large question of is the

00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:19,929
site fast yet and I'm sorry to say that

00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:22,710
I do not have a clear answer to this as

00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:25,990
you might have been able to tell from

00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:28,750
the rest of this talk but I will say

00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:30,539
that I felt way better about being able

00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,770
to tackle different web performance

00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:35,049
challenges just by going through this

00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:36,909
and by thinking really incrementally and

00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:39,909
by also just starting from a place of

00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:42,039
understanding and collaboration and

00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:46,240
working together and not just thinking

00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:50,289
that this is just an engineering and so

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:52,690
I like to think about these five steps

00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:55,570
we went through because we do have some

00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:57,490
answers we now know why we care about

00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:59,980
performance for whatever we're working

00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:04,330
on we have a shared understanding of

00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:07,419
what fast means we have ideas of ways to

00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:09,520
measure performance we have also a

00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:11,830
shared understanding of how fast is fast

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,530
enough and where we're trying to go and

00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:17,169
we have some plans for how to stay fast

00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:19,690
and so I hope that you if you've ever

00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:23,530
felt intimidated by a big question like

00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:25,059
this or not known where start with web

00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:27,460
performance or felt like you didn't have

00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:29,440
the time this will give you some

00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:34,860
inspiration to getting a little closer

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,860
