As the owners of web performance, my team is often asked some version of the question “Is the site fast yet?”. While it sounds simple, it's actually impossible to answer without asking more questions. “Is our site fast in New York but slow in Sydney? Is it fast on all devices or just on desktop? How fast is fast enough and most importantly, what does fast even mean?”. In this talk, I’ll share what we've learned while finding an answer to this question, including how to conduct a performance audit, how to talk about performance with your teammates outside of engineering, and how to advocate for your users by making performance a priority.
