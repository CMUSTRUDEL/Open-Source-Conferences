00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:13,080
hi I'm career career T'Pol I started my

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,920
career as a web developer in the late

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,020
90s and for the last couple years I've

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,240
been the product manager for mdn and

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:26,730
yeah we've done this mdn web developer

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:28,320
needs assessment so this project that

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,650
I'm about to talk to this started in

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,960
late 2017 and was shortly after CSS grid

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,540
was shipped and CSS grant was actually a

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,640
massive success so in the muslim' of

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,980
developer relations team we asked

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,950
ourselves how can we have more of these

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:49,140
wins how can we support that so that we

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:52,050
do this again and again and CSS grid was

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,760
a success and it addressed user needs it

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,129
shipped in all the browser's at roughly

00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,180
the same time and it came with tooling

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:03,480
in the case of Firefox was the grid

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:07,049
inspector and there was seriously

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:10,110
awesome but that said the CSS granite

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:13,080
was years in the making and layout had

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:16,830
been an issue at least since the late

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:21,030
90s when we abuse tables to implement

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:23,210
our UI designs so looking at this we had

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,530
a few questions why did it take until

00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:28,560
2012 to even start addressing this

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:32,430
problem and why did it take until 2017

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:36,090
to ship it to developers and how is this

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,700
coordinated so that it roughly at the

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,850
same time to in all the major browsers

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,939
and what the what was already roadblocks

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:48,439
for that and what were the pivotal

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,939
elements to actually keep it moving so

00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:52,500
we took a step back to see what the

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,720
whole process looked like from Muslims

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,020
perspective mostly so after interviewing

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,299
numerous people who were involved in the

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,570
process we identified three distinct

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,549
phases so you have the research phase

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,369
the standardization implementation and

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,989
the adoption phase and now as you can

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,500
probably tell this is this is a very

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:15,590
simplified process it's smooth

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:20,360
many things and it looks like a pipeline

00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:23,540
when it's actually like a loop or a loop

00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,820
of loops that loop on themselves I mean

00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,330
you get the idea but this was this was

00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,530
good enough for us to get started and

00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:33,290
most of us had pretty good idea about

00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:37,040
the adoption rate about the adoption

00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:39,260
side because that's where MBN is and

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,880
that's where ambien shines and we had

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,460
some idea about the standardization

00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,870
implementation aspect of this but we

00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,420
wanted to know more about the research

00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:50,480
phase so how do we learn about developer

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,560
pain points what they need and what we

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,870
should prioritize to the web platform

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,510
and we interviewed more than 10 people

00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:59,500
involved in this process at different

00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:03,620
stages of it and it became clear that

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:07,310
there was no formal research really that

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:09,110
at muslimah we have an amazing user

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:12,320
research team when it comes to Firefox

00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,430
but for developer research that wasn't

00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,980
as much the case it wasn't this

00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:18,890
established and this is important

00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,410
because the place like Mozilla we

00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,660
automated resources as we can't go after

00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,310
everything and there are serious

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,020
opportunity costs that we pay when we

00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,820
decide to do something because it

00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,790
usually means we can't do something else

00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:33,740
and that's along the whole process so

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,570
it's it's an acceleration implementation

00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:40,820
but it's the same thing when it comes to

00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:42,430
adoption so this is what we hear what we

00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:47,209
heard from people that we interviewed

00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:49,100
about how things are prioritized and one

00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:50,810
thing really stood out because almost

00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,580
every every single person said the same

00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,550
thing here we need to hear from

00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,080
developers and it makes so much sense

00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,670
because none of us can be successful

00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,050
without that part it's it's hard to

00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:04,070
prioritize the right things without

00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:06,350
knowing what what developer pain points

00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,430
are it's hard to find the right solution

00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,040
it's hard to get people to adopt

00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,230
something if it doesn't solve their

00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,870
problem really or if it doesn't solve

00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,790
the problem in the right way so for all

00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,220
of those reasons we propose the

00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,260
developer needs assessments so what is

00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,060
that exactly

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,110
it's the prioritized list of designer

00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:29,120
and developer needs it's

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:32,520
and simple - for harsh prioritization

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:36,750
that's representing diverse populations

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,939
and a huge feature space it's published

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,099
on ambien it's not owned by a single

00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:42,539
vendor though we initially proposed this

00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:43,889
under the umbrella of the MDM product

00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:46,259
Advisory Board where we have

00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:50,330
representation from browser vendors the

00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:52,439
w3c and industry stakeholders and

00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,210
because we think as a community we need

00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:56,400
to have at least a common understanding

00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,860
of the facts when it comes to needs even

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,330
if we draw different conclusions from

00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,289
them and then finally it's it's

00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:07,440
reproduced annually and this is

00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:09,030
important as an industry we need to know

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,460
whether we are addressing developer pain

00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,940
points and to understand whether we are

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:16,409
prioritizing correctly we need to track

00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,349
needs and pain points over time so we

00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:23,879
can see the impact of those efforts

00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:25,650
essentially and if you do this well we

00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:29,819
think the MDL developer needs assessment

00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:30,990
or the NBN web DNA for short it can be a

00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:35,400
voice of designers and developers

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:37,080
working on the web and asking about web

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,389
developer and designer needs and

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,210
frustrations is not trivial because the

00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:47,129
the problem space is so vast and the

00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:48,419
audience is so diverse so let me tell

00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:51,599
you a bit about the process we went

00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:55,020
through for that we didn't just slap a

00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:57,779
survey on the website and I apologize up

00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,969
front because I'm not a researcher we

00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:01,620
worked with a very talented Ellison

00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:04,529
Mickey from pinpoint research to the

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,900
research design and to conduct this so

00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:10,440
I'll try to do my best to channel her

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:13,889
here in January this year we started the

00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,409
process by fielding a survey to to the

00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:18,120
product advisory board members where we

00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:21,509
asked for data that they would use for

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,270
decision-making and we then had almost

00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:26,190
20 in-depth interviews with web

00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,560
developers and designers before putting

00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,659
together the initial version of the

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,209
survey and that is because we wanted the

00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:34,810
survey to be rooted in the voice of

00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:36,490
developers and designers

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,410
and we wanted to do that from the get-go

00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,440
had we run the survey without the

00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:44,020
interviews the questions would would

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,380
have been based on the Intel perception

00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,760
of browser vendors mostly and by

00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,590
conducting the interviews we made sure

00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,270
to derive the survey questions from the

00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,430
stories of developers and designers

00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:58,600
about what is important to them in their

00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:01,590
work on the web but also what is what

00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:04,419
what the frustrations are for them and

00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:06,430
to go from the interview findings to the

00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:09,550
survey we follow two pinpoints analysis

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,380
process going from observations the very

00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:15,040
bottom what we saw and heard essentially

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:18,100
two insights what they mean two critical

00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:21,940
themes on the highest level to look at

00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,590
what why it matters and we are

00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:27,940
continuing that process to incorporate

00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:28,840
the survey findings that we with the

00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,530
findings that we learned from these

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,150
pilot interviews in in practice that

00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:36,070
means we transcribed

00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:39,669
16 hours of interviews we then coded

00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:42,330
them and we then bucketed them to derive

00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:52,479
insights for the items in our survey and

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:57,160
that is a very hands-on process okay so

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:58,900
wait this is this is the coding and this

00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,240
is this is the bucket thing so this is a

00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:04,539
very hands-on process where you actually

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,760
put things out so based on these teams

00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:08,260
we constructed the central survey

00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,150
question around the frustration of web

00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:12,160
developers and designers and then we

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,440
continued to work with our product

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,520
advisory board on the overall survey

00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:20,380
with pilot interviews where we watched

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,090
multiple people take the survey at every

00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,310
iteration to make sure that the survey

00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:27,130
questions where as unambiguous as

00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:30,190
possible and with the help of more than

00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:32,200
30 stakeholders from various MDM product

00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,270
advisory board members we put together

00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,610
the final version of the survey and it

00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:38,979
was fielded in July of this year on M

00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,330
the end but also through the social

00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:42,370
media channels of a product advisory

00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:45,660
board members to w3c Google Microsoft

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:48,540
Samsung and beaucoup

00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,069
and it wasn't just done in English like

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,779
this one

00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:54,870
we localized the survey in eight

00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:57,360
languages it's Arabic simplified Chinese

00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:59,220
English French Japanese Korean Brazilian

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,439
Portuguese Russian and Spanish because

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,199
we felt it was important to get really

00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:06,480
that diverse input and not just from

00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:10,589
people who actually speak and understand

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,230
English so I'm really happy to announce

00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:16,439
that after fielding this survey for four

00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,839
weeks more than 76,000 people took us up

00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:20,670
on it and more than 20,000 developers

00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,279
and designers took the 20 minutes

00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:30,500
necessary to fully complete the survey

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:32,790
from from 173 countries actually and

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,790
just for the complete responses alone

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:38,569
that's more than 10,000 hours of time

00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:41,399
that country that developers contributed

00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:43,199
to help us understand what their pain

00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,910
points and needs are so we really want

00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:47,459
to make sure we we make use of that we

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:50,550
make good use of that and we believe

00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:52,620
that this makes the ndn web developer

00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:54,269
needs assessment the biggest web

00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,870
developer and designer focused survey

00:09:54,269 --> 00:10:01,050
ever conducted and with that scale come

00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:03,509
benefits we can segment the data by

00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:06,720
experience level by developer role

00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:09,269
country satisfaction and still have we

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,970
will still have very high confidence in

00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:13,949
the results we get from that because the

00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:16,800
segments are big enough so there's

00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:19,529
definitely a benefits to getting this

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,540
many responses so after talking about

00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:24,389
the survey in the abstract for so long I

00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,279
thought I would share a few questions

00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:28,470
aside from the the core of the survey

00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,660
about things that developers find the

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:33,389
most frustrating and and these are in no

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,759
particular order how would you rate your

00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:38,519
overall satisfaction with the web as a

00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:41,100
as a platform and set of tools to enable

00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,600
you to build what you need or want what

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,360
are the things that you would like to be

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,639
able to do on the web that but but like

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,959
what platform features to do and one of

00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,480
the biggest pain points for you when it

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,620
comes to JavaScript development and we

00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,220
ask the same questions

00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:58,450
for HTML and CSS and web

00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,710
and since it's boring to just see the

00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,980
questions let me share a little bit

00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:05,080
about the about the results so the first

00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,640
one is a list of top five items that

00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,100
cause developers the most frustration

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,890
this is across all countries rose

00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,870
experienced this level and so on for the

00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:16,390
first really first on the list is

00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:19,480
interoperability so having to support

00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:22,140
specific browsers and yes we do have to

00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:25,660
follow up we will do follow up on this

00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:28,630
about what browsers and and what causes

00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,070
the biggest relations there but that's

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,200
the that's number one other list the

00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,880
second one listed documentation but it's

00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,130
very specifically documentation for

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,090
frameworks and libraries and tools not

00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:43,780
web standards there is rank much lower

00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:46,000
the third one again interoperability

00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,380
issue interoperability issue but this

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,510
time the fact that developers have to

00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,980
avoid using a feature because it's just

00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:55,060
not implemented in all the browsers that

00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:57,850
they need to support and fourth is

00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,860
testing across browsers and fifth is

00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,900
once again in interoperability issue at

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,760
this one about making design look and

00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:07,420
feel the same across different browsers

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:11,530
and I don't know about you but I see a

00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:13,750
c---minus yeah so in our final report

00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:16,210
we'll go back to the 16 hours of

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:19,240
interviews and at detail in color for

00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:20,800
for these items especially when it comes

00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,930
to interoperability because people did

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,460
tell us in those interviews very

00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,560
specifically what causes time issues

00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,880
there

00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,250
the second item I want to share is this

00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,080
when a new web technology is that's

00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,150
relevant to your needs becomes available

00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,990
what are the main barriers to adoption

00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:40,780
and usually when this question is asked

00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:43,480
regardless of platform the documentation

00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:45,670
and sample codes is the answer that is

00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,640
what most of all push carrot bot and

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:51,100
it's indeed listed here but it's listed

00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,610
in second place the number one issue is

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:56,500
very the number one issue and barrier to

00:12:54,610 --> 00:13:00,060
adoption is actually brought

00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,060
interoperability across browsers

00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,800
it's not all bad though so when we ask

00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,860
the question what is the biggest pain

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:12,040
point you have at HTML the number-one

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:15,340
answer is nothing at least for one third

00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,310
of the people we are so people working

00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:20,710
on that are doing something right and

00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:22,090
finally how would you rate your overall

00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,190
satisfaction with the web as a platform

00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:27,460
and set of tools to enable you to build

00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:30,370
what you need or want and yeah this is a

00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:33,250
full 76 percent or either satisfied or

00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:35,260
very satisfied and that's something to

00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,870
be proud of really as people who work on

00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:41,530
the web to push to push the web forward

00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:43,240
here of all places so I hope you keep

00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,100
that in mind when you hear complaints

00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,960
about web developer experiences but this

00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,390
is something to this is something to

00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:55,750
celebrate too and we shouldn't stop

00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:58,630
there so this what I just showed it was

00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,730
just a preview so this is much more than

00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:03,160
this we will put into the full report

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:08,710
that we intend to publish by the end of

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:10,900
this month and as I said we want this to

00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:12,520
be in any of any other thing we want we

00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,160
don't want this to be just a one-time

00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,890
effort so the next iteration will start

00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,740
in March 2020 we will then feel the

00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:24,850
survey hopefully in May and publish the

00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:29,770
results in September 20 2004 hopefully

00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:31,450
around before you source so we can talk

00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,610
about it again at the view source next

00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:35,950
year so that's the as at least that's

00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:39,610
the time that we intend to go with

00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:41,110
hopefully it will work out and this is

00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,790
also where we need your help and input

00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,800
this is the first iteration of this

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:48,670
survey and it's far from perfect but it

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:52,690
is a start and since you're at the

00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:54,070
target audience for this we want we knew

00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,810
we need your input for this we want the

00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:59,380
next iteration to be much better and we

00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:02,190
need you to tell us what our target

00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:04,420
audience is how useful is this for you

00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:06,280
what level of granularity would you

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,860
actually need to make decisions based on

00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,390
this and the goal is to hear the voice

00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,170
of developers and designers working on

00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:14,660
the web and to have it

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:17,870
simple tool for harsh prioritization

00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:20,420
representing diverse audiences and a

00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:22,310
huge future space and I'm extremely

00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,290
excited that we've made the first step

00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:26,329
in that direction so many thanks to

00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,920
everyone who has contributed to that and

00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:29,500
I'm looking forward to many more of

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,870
these

00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,480
[Applause]
