all right thanks so much Ruth okay so I

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,950
am hoping that the talk yesterday set

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,719
you up to think of some questions that

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,509
you might want to ask our esteemed panel

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,639
and to get started I actually want to

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,369
ask each of them to do a quick

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,289
introduction to their areas of

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:22,949
standardization and their communities

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:25,320
Julia thanks so my name is Julia starts

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,689
I work at Mozilla I'm also a delegate

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,070
for Mozilla at the tc39 which is the

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,769
standards body that Joey introduced

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,610
yesterday and I am also one of three

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:38,160
co-chairs of that standardizing body

00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:40,260
great great to be here Wendy seltzer I

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,250
am strategy leading counsel to the World

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:47,579
Wide Web Consortium w3c and we do

00:00:44,250 --> 00:01:06,570
voluntary consensus standards for the

00:00:47,579 --> 00:01:08,040
web platform today and I w3c as well as

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,840
IETF I do some we're going to go off

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,189
there and also the co-founder of the

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,130
indie web community and network on

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,020
standards there as well

00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,090
and I'm Natasha Rooney I work at GSMA

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,540
which is a telecoms association my

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:24,360
experiences in w3c IETF and some telco

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,549
standards bodies - all right so quite a

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,990
bit of experience on the stage and you

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,420
know in addition to you know those

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,310
groups we also have folks here from like

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,159
what WG and other probably standards

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,350
communities so I think there's quite a

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,990
lot going on in these spaces

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,780
and a question I think I get a lot is

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,790
like how do you discover where different

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,649
work is happening and are these groups

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,119
collaborating with one another so I

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,369
thought it might be interesting if we

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,770
started chatting about how our groups

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:57,860
are collaborating and what they're

00:01:52,770 --> 00:02:02,299
working on when do you want to assure

00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:04,259
w3c who thinks the our work at the

00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:07,160
application layer so we do a lot of

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:11,009
liaison work with IETF and the protocols

00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,790
underneath that we also more recently

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:16,329
are working with the what working

00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:20,379
group which is doing the dhtml standard

00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:23,620
and we had a little bit of a challenge

00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:26,890
initially as you know there were two

00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,599
versions of the HTML spec and there were

00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,730
some incompatibilities between them and

00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:33,370
we decided that wasn't a way for the web

00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:37,000
to work the web demands compatibility

00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:40,060
and cooperation and so last year we

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,680
formed memorandum of understanding with

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,889
the what working group so the what

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,340
working group has the HTML and Dom specs

00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:51,400
and w3c has a cooperative relationship

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:55,000
with that with our HTML working group

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,510
helping to feed input and reviews and

00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,489
comments into the work both of us have

00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:06,760
similar work modes we work in github

00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:09,629
they work in github w3c has a strong

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:13,079
tradition of web for all that includes

00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:14,819
horizontal reviews security privacy

00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:18,340
accessibility and internationalization

00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:22,690
and so in working with what working

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:25,030
group we want to share that knowledge

00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:28,269
and the input of the broader web

00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:30,430
community with that group which is you

00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:33,849
know start speed by being browser

00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:37,870
implementer focused and also welcomes

00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:39,340
the the broader input yeah and so you

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,590
raised a good point about sort of like

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,319
that review process and kind of sharing

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:47,109
this sort of oversight of certain pieces

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,970
of work are there examples in your areas

00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:57,340
that you can think of where that happens

00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:59,939
between the groups I was saying related

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:03,129
to you ITF and w3c a little bit more

00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:04,389
more traditionally in sort of standards

00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:07,150
bodies which are a little bit older with

00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:08,799
there's usually a liaison and that

00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,379
liaisons usually either a person or

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,299
sometimes a letter and that gets sent

00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:15,519
between standards bodies to say we're

00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:17,259
working on this thing and I think 3gpp

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,709
did this which is a telco standards body

00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:23,139
related to 5g standards they sent an

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:24,990
email to I do have to say we're doing

00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:26,699
this now

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,039
then I it's a little bit better in

00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,900
Internet and web standards bodies and I

00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:33,599
think WebRTC is probably one of the

00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,310
greatest examples their web RTC involved

00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:39,990
a lot of standards at the protocol layer

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:43,590
and on the web so there's a working

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:47,009
group in w3c and some groups in an IETF

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:48,720
and although not both sets of people go

00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:50,729
to each other there's sort of a core

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,199
group that will go to both

00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:53,819
so find that's where the best

00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,229
collaboration happens where you've got

00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:57,330
sort of this core group of people which

00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:59,370
are dancing between both standards

00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,139
bodies and carrying things on it's a

00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:05,280
little bit more cohesive than that

00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:08,099
standard old liaison method do you find

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:12,380
that that also ends up influencing the

00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:17,400
work and the processes of your groups

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:19,919
yes some good it's best when good

00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,690
practices get carried over so I can't

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,729
remember who started the github thing

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,800
but there was I think actually w3c was

00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:27,180
quite quite forward and doing this I

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,759
don't know about the other standards

00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,740
bodies but mostly w3c an idea and then

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,360
IETF picked up a lot on that kind of

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,800
github usage I'm not talking

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,419
specifically about github but how the

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,650
collaboration on that started to happen

00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:43,860
issue development labeling conversations

00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,539
collaborations and brought back into ITF

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,310
and so I think it happened because of

00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,870
those core individuals were dancing

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:56,190
between these two groups so yeah it does

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:57,870
happen so we have people who are

00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,990
communicating across standards bodies so

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,639
tc39 has liaisons from the CSS working

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,860
group and from what what what week and

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,060
other places but it's also interesting

00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,669
when we are actually working with a

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,159
technical question recently we had this

00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:13,110
with built-in modules where part of the

00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:16,319
work was actually being worked in the

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,849
web IDL repository and we were this

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,169
would be a layering situation where it

00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:23,009
would be implemented and web ideal and

00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:24,479
then tc39 would come on top of that so

00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:25,650
that's also an interesting mode of

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,550
collaboration that happens across

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:32,310
standards bodies kind of getting back to

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:34,800
the github and sort of that evolution of

00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:37,160
the process of making standards from

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,340
more paper driven

00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,380
letters and things do you know kind of

00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:46,550
open-source style development practices

00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,810
I think w3c has been pretty on the

00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,690
forefront of that there's quoted quite a

00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:54,110
few tools and you know repositories and

00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:55,880
stuff tc39 also has kind of recently

00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,990
could have been leading the way and some

00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,430
of this I'm curious if you want to talk

00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:03,740
a little bit about some of the process

00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:04,760
while we're doing there oh yeah I was

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,690
curious if you wanted to talk a little

00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:10,400
bit about the tc39 process on github in

00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,960
that coming right so we have a pretty

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,180
well-defined process I wasn't sure if we

00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,070
wanted to talk about how we're trying to

00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,080
open up the process or specifically the

00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:21,920
process document that we have so we have

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,420
a public document under tc39 dot es

00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,120
slash process if you want to take a look

00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:28,190
and that outlines the process that we've

00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,050
agreed to so tc39 is an unusual

00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,720
standards body in that we operated on

00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,130
consensus and this isn't just most of

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,460
the room agrees in our case it's the

00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:39,170
entire room agrees and in this case

00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,900
consensus also means something a little

00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:45,290
bit more subtle it's more that we don't

00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:50,360
have a specific block against a feature

00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:52,430
and we work through four stages starting

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,880
with stage 0 the strawman proposal which

00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:59,630
is it could be any idea anyone can

00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,800
propose a proposal to the tc39 and it

00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,750
gets presented to the committee we

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,760
discuss if we want to do some more work

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,470
in it which would lead us into broader

00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,650
discussion about what this feature would

00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:12,200
mean and represent that's stage one from

00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,820
stage two we move on to stage from stage

00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,180
one we moved to stage two where we're

00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:20,120
doing more detailed design work around

00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,860
the process once the design has been

00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,080
settled and agreed to by the committee

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,210
we move on to stage three which takes us

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,730
into implementation and getting feedback

00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:32,390
from users based on the implementations

00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:34,550
finally once we have at least two

00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,500
implementations and we have agreed and

00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,820
taken whatever feedback comes from this

00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,360
stage we move on to stage four where

00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,110
it's considered for the specification I

00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,380
had a question actually

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,370
how does tc39 ideal when when you don't

00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,410
have consensus

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:52,250
so that's a really interesting question

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:55,430
and usually what happens is we would go

00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:57,980
and discuss further like if if someone

00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,810
blocks a proposal then we would discuss

00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,460
further and see if we can work around

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,230
the constraints that this person is

00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,150
presenting this usually happens when a

00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,440
delegate has an invariant in mind is

00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,710
something about the language that they

00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,589
believe very strongly shouldn't change

00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:14,810
for example it might be a specific

00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:16,940
performance concern or something about

00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:18,860
usability that should not change and

00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,640
they may block this kind of a block

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,600
usually comes at stage 1 or stage 2

00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,150
sometimes we can get around it and

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:31,250
sometimes we can't when we can't usually

00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:33,260
the purple is stopped however we do see

00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,029
resurgence --is and proposals like

00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:42,260
reimagining of ideas and things like

00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:45,920
that this is very very different from

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:48,050
the way the working group and any web

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,680
community work which are it's very much

00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:53,630
more sort of bubbling up ground up where

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,700
people just sort of throw something out

00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:58,670
there and and then see what sticks kind

00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:00,350
of thing and I feel like in the in the

00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,490
OAuth group I see a lot of different

00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,790
people working on different things in

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,260
parallel and not so much of a like we

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,790
are all building this one thing but

00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,589
we're all building many small things

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,089
together and the same with any web

00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:14,330
community where anybody can just sort of

00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:15,560
show up propose an idea and it's not

00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,450
like you're bringing it to this

00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,850
committee you're just bringing it into

00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,930
the community and seeing if anybody else

00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,870
is interested in willing to actually

00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,070
build it so that is interesting also

00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,750
because often we do have multiple

00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,180
proposals but we also have sort of

00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:31,220
themes that organically develop in

00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,230
committee for example class-based

00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,640
proposals things like this so that is an

00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:40,820
interesting thing that happens in tc39 I

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:43,040
think w3c we also see you know a lot of

00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,900
work lately coming in through community

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,390
groups and we have the web incubator

00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:50,180
community group and then a whole range

00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:52,820
of topics specific community groups

00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,860
where people gather anyone can propose a

00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,950
community group anyone can propose an

00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:00,080
idea start building it starts

00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:04,040
backing it out and then bring it forward

00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:08,900
to a working group to put it on to the

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:11,510
recommendation track and we w3c team and

00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,330
the community that have evaluate what's

00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:17,600
the interest do we have something that's

00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:19,490
likely to lead to multiple interoperable

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:24,200
implementations which is one of the

00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:26,540
necessary criteria for building to a w3c

00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,240
recommendation do we have enough

00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:32,660
interest from different parts of the

00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:37,070
community to make those implementations

00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:39,820
successful and useful go ahead luck then

00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:43,400
let's put that on the wrecked wreck and

00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:46,490
and see what we can make of it so I'm

00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,840
curious if we see based on kind of this

00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,530
quick discussion of the different

00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:55,130
processes here common challenges between

00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:58,190
groups on on standards making here like

00:11:55,130 --> 00:12:00,490
obviously decision making is one do you

00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,720
guys want to address challenges here

00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:05,060
that's one of the reasons why else the

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,710
question previously is developing

00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:09,470
standards on consensus is the right way

00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:12,620
to do it but it does make things very

00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:15,670
slow and so if you have people who are

00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:20,390
disagreeing it can draw things out a lot

00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:22,250
w3c I have seen this happen but it's

00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:24,320
it's in a little bit of a better place

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,900
an IETF this is quite prevalent at the

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,240
moment cuz there's been a large amount

00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:31,880
of work going forward to push security

00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:35,000
and encryption on to the Internet and

00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:37,820
that's sometimes met some companies have

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,190
come in with some ideas which have kind

00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,320
of combatted this a little bit and so

00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:44,270
there's sort of the decision-making

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,820
around this gets dragged out a lot

00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:48,320
because of that and work gets delayed

00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:53,750
because of that that causes people to

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:55,640
get frustrated so it's it's it's a tough

00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,730
thing I think both standards bodies do

00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,920
have some methods some something written

00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:03,680
in the process document for voting so if

00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,780
there really is no way that you can get

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,410
consensus there there is a voting

00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,990
fallback mechanism but

00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:12,269
seen it used incredibly rarely in w3c a

00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,560
little bit more in ITF with their homing

00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:17,069
methods that we were mentioning earlier

00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,480
and the w3c is now kind of taken on an

00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:20,759
initiative that I know you worked a bit

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,129
on which is that that process for busy

00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:25,560
people and a new process 2020

00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:30,810
document what it was it like to revise

00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:33,240
process because that's sort of like I

00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,589
wrote the process of a process document

00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,439
for busy people which I'll link in

00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:39,089
Twitter later because I did a tenure on

00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:41,370
that ABI was on the advisory board for a

00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:43,259
couple of years which is a group at the

00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:45,470
w3c which looks after the process

00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:48,360
document and some of the running of w3c

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,069
and I one of the things we do is look

00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:55,620
after that process document and it's

00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:57,629
impossible to read very difficult and it

00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,819
was a very simple document that then

00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:02,519
sort of got its got plunked on top of it

00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:06,209
so it became this monster and so um we

00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:07,769
revised that for the it to be easier to

00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:09,750
read and in simple English I was very

00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:11,670
proud because one of our colleagues in

00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,259
who is Japanese translated it into

00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,880
Japanese it's a hard thing to do with it

00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:17,040
with sort of it this is not a legal

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,899
document it's a simplification of a

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,199
legal document but I was proud about

00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:23,790
that there is a great deal of work going

00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:26,490
on now with some very intelligent

00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,649
individuals to completely redo it and

00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:30,240
incorporate some very large pieces of

00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:33,529
work like evergreen standard so I think

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,529
the name may have changed recently

00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:39,480
so we face that the tension between sort

00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,790
of agility and stability

00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,759
do we want standards that keep up with

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:46,769
the tip of development and you know the

00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,839
most advanced implementation or do we

00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:51,870
want standards that you can refer to for

00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:55,709
a place that the platform is and will be

00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:59,639
for a period of time and different

00:14:55,709 --> 00:15:02,329
people want different set points there

00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,500
so we've been working on a process for

00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:09,600
continuous development we're now calling

00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:11,759
it to build in some of the reviews and

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,639
some of the patent commitments w3c has a

00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:17,699
royalty-free patent policy that assures

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:21,089
that anyone can implement a w3c spec

00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:22,649
without facing patent

00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:26,160
he demands from anyone else

00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:28,589
participating in SPECT development so we

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,470
want to incorporate those things into a

00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:34,079
continuously evolving document rather

00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,970
than saying it's only when it gets to

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,180
recommendation at the end of the line

00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:42,240
that all of those assurances come in and

00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:45,709
so that is a fundamental change to the

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,240
way the process has worked and requires

00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:49,949
lots of different elements to work

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,629
together you know we need to get the

00:15:49,949 --> 00:16:01,829
engineers and the lawyers talking

00:15:51,629 --> 00:16:03,899
together to make this process these kind

00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:06,749
of formal groups but I want to ask Aaron

00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:08,899
about process and and decision-making in

00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:12,689
community building and sort of those

00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:16,589
indie web / open-source spaces yeah we

00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:18,240
have we do have a process as well for

00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:22,499
the specs that work through the indie

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,300
web community it is much less strict and

00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:27,149
there's no like timelines in law that's

00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:30,059
all just sort of the I guess the idea is

00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:32,040
to get to something that is we don't

00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:33,120
ever consider a spec like final we kind

00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,980
of treat everything as ever-evolving

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,230
because it's meant to document the

00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:40,709
reality of the world rather than trying

00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:43,290
to be like a declaration but you know we

00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:45,689
do have we mostly follow the

00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:48,089
microformats process which has been

00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:49,529
written up it's has changed over time as

00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:53,449
well we've got three iterations on that

00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:56,189
in terms of what exactly it entails but

00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:58,110
you know process process does have to be

00:16:56,189 --> 00:17:03,029
written down otherwise it is just gonna

00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:05,490
be chaos and and then you know we're

00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:07,919
talking about how this also slows that

00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:10,620
that process can really be very slow

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:13,110
moving with the indie web approach can

00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:15,449
move a little bit quicker right I think

00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:17,490
tc39 is a little interesting because of

00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:19,169
the way we do the yearly standard and I

00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,000
wondered if you wanted to talk about

00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:23,010
that so it is interesting because we

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,890
have a rolling standard we release

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:29,340
whatever work we've done up to a certain

00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,899
point in the year as as Ahmed 2020 so

00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,070
everyone can now make the joke

00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:36,810
everything is

00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:39,630
so does 2020 but we we do have a rolling

00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:41,430
spec and the idea isn't that each year

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:44,040
we come out with a new spec it's really

00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:46,530
that we release the results of our work

00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,180
at that point it's also interesting how

00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:50,640
this rolls into the staging process

00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,230
because at stage three were essentially

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,060
sending a signal to implementers that

00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,160
they it is now safe to implement because

00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:59,790
we will not be making significant design

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,230
decisions at this point so I think

00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,340
that's another interesting thing just

00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:05,820
going back to your point about stability

00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:07,800
and agility we want to be able to change

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,750
our minds and like address problems that

00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,340
come up with specifications but at the

00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,830
same time we need to also give a strong

00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,140
signal that it's safe to start investing

00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:18,630
in sometimes implementing some very

00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:21,180
complex proposals so it's also a balance

00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:23,430
of those things and yeah just to round

00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,200
that back to our rolling release

00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:27,150
schedule it's sort of a point at which

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,560
we make official that this is a

00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:34,020
recommendation from tc39 so learning all

00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,580
of these different processes as we've

00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,370
been mentioning is really really

00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:41,790
difficult right you know w3c process

00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:44,700
document is a monster it's really hard

00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:47,250
for newcomers to learn I'm curious what

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,460
different organizations are doing to

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:52,680
sort of make process more knowable make

00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,140
it more agile make it more responsive to

00:18:52,680 --> 00:19:00,240
the way people want to work like the

00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:01,950
more indie web way I suppose so I think

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,460
one thing that's interesting coming from

00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:07,740
tc39 is our how we work initiative which

00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:12,720
was partially based off of the work that

00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:15,120
Natasha did with the how to with the

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,150
process document for busy people where

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,310
we tried to write down our process and

00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:23,400
all of the culture around making

00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:25,440
standards at tc39 in in a github

00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,320
repository that's available and

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,540
accessible to everyone who wants to take

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,060
part in that and also partial that part

00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,920
of that was releasing a website that's

00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,780
geared towards developers rather than

00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,670
people who are already feeling

00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,260
comfortable working with spec language

00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:43,500
because spec language is this weird

00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,440
space where it's semi legal very calm

00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,620
very

00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,780
abstracted language for a good reason I

00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:53,020
think also I think that's a big part of

00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:54,640
it which is I don't even necessarily see

00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,800
that the finding the process is the

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,600
barrier here I feel like feeling like

00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,850
you can be part of the process as the

00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,820
barrier because yeah spec language is

00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:05,350
such a tous way of describing something

00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:08,110
and it's not how you're gonna go and

00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,040
learn the concepts behind what's going

00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,680
on what's being described in the

00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,330
document and yeah it is for good reason

00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,060
it is for good it serves its purpose

00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:18,120
that way but I think you need to have

00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,140
that other way of presenting the ideas

00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,480
more focused to people who are going to

00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:25,210
be writing the software and writing

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,650
software using the technology and I

00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:30,490
think that is a big challenge of like

00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:31,540
how do you how do you make that lot

00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,130
people know that that is something they

00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,420
can participate in and actually get

00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:39,280
involved in the development of the

00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:42,610
standards the standards bodies can still

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,520
do in this area I have some unbaked work

00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:47,290
which is more sort of getting people up

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,890
and running on w3c which I should

00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:52,840
revisit one of the things I that helped

00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:55,630
me as a new person within standards

00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:58,000
bodies was finding was finding a mentor

00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:59,350
that was and it wasn't that I asked will

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,800
you be my mentor there was just a few

00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:04,090
extremely helpful individuals that

00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,290
really started to help so if you are

00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,840
interested in getting involved that was

00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:09,250
my number one thing and actually within

00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:12,130
w3c specifically it was a Mozilla

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:14,350
employee who became my mentors co-chair

00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:17,500
of my working group and so a co-chair of

00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:19,600
my interest group and has been a

00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,280
long-standing mentor for me within w3c

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,880
so that's a big tip if you're getting

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,160
started

00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,640
I think the w3c is started to kind of

00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:31,110
experiment with buddy systems for TPAC

00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:34,330
and other body systems and co-chairing

00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:37,750
chairing is a hard job and it's 365 days

00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:41,560
a year so don't ever chair by yourself I

00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:44,050
do that it's a tough gig you will be in

00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:46,120
your in your swim outfit on a

00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:49,540
teleconference call on a beach is just

00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,370
not fun so a co-chair really helps and

00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:53,320
especially somebody who has a different

00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,820
skill set or different level experienced

00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,590
here

00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,060
eventually you will be that person who

00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:01,440
has that experience mentoring your

00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:03,060
co-chairs so that's w3c is doing that

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,820
now ITF has been doing that for a long

00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:09,060
time it's a good are there other

00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:11,580
resources y'all can think of I think

00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:15,030
when we've been experimenting with it's

00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:18,000
a little kind of baking right now is

00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:21,330
outreach groups for tc39 I don't know if

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,220
you want to mention so one thing that

00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,630
we've noticed the tc39 is is often hard

00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,540
to bring people in and get their

00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:29,670
feedback so we've started directly

00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,230
reaching out to specific groups for

00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,940
example we have an outreach group for

00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:35,460
educators and outreach group for tools

00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:39,930
and frameworks and we go to them because

00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:41,640
we can be a little bit intimidating and

00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:44,090
the goal there is to make sure that we

00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,280
get a broad view on how people are

00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:48,720
understanding our proposals what places

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,940
are our blind spots what we're not

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,050
seeing and these take the form of

00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:56,190
monthly or bimonthly telecom calls so

00:22:55,050 --> 00:23:03,000
that's something that we've been trying

00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:06,300
out I think w3c both you know takes in

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,940
ideas from the community and so some of

00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:11,000
the innovations that we've seen recently

00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:14,070
moving to github was spurred by

00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,500
community members saying this is where

00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:19,910
we do work and you know let's not use

00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:22,740
mercurial or CVS checkouts anymore but

00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:25,890
frame our spec development through

00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:28,950
issues and pull requests and get up and

00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:30,900
that's moved to most of our working

00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:34,800
groups we now do almost all of our work

00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:38,550
in public available to anyone to watch

00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:41,190
and participate in the discussion and

00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:43,710
then you know we need membership for the

00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:46,500
paten commitments at the time that

00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:50,700
you're trying to contribute to spec

00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:54,360
development so we get from the community

00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:56,790
the idea of explainers and so it's not

00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,980
just the process but sometimes the

00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:02,400
technology in a spec itself can be

00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:04,140
difficult to parse from the spec so an

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,470
explainer written and simpler language

00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,360
of what

00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:11,650
trying to do here what will success look

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:15,250
like what's required to make this API or

00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:17,320
feature effective goes into an explainer

00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:21,400
and somebody else who sees that meeting

00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:24,280
a business use case can can add even if

00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,669
they don't have the technical knowledge

00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:30,250
of what it would require to fix that

00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:32,980
getting a broad sense of the demand for

00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:34,870
a fix can help spur others in the

00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:39,070
community to think about what would it

00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:43,590
take to to address that need from web

00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:52,049
developers from app developers web apps

00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:55,120
and so another piece that's relatively

00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:59,070
stronger in w3c is the role of the team

00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:02,320
we have a large team of technical

00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:07,870
experts team contacts who are there to

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:09,700
help in making it a useful forum and so

00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:12,760
if at any point you're trying to get

00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:16,030
engaged with a w3c group and can't

00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,890
figure out is this right feel free to

00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:20,169
reach out to the team contacts we're

00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:23,559
there to help steer you in the right

00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:26,500
direction raises a good question

00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:31,090
to me so w3c is this group that has

00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:33,850
quite a bit of staff and what about the

00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:36,070
other groups and do you have are there

00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:39,030
management is there a parent org that

00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:41,700
you know helps with any of this for

00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:44,200
indie web is complete opposite it's just

00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,000
individuals working on stuff together

00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,280
and there is no we're not even

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:59,289
officially an organization we're just a

00:25:48,280 --> 00:26:00,220
community with a website and that was

00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:03,610
that the where is the money come from

00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,750
question well Jeremy Keith asked me to

00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:06,100
ask you know where does the money come

00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,669
from but I think we can have a more

00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,669
nuanced conversation

00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:14,779
[Laughter]

00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:17,539
I can give some info on ietf yeah it's a

00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:18,769
non membership organization so if you

00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:21,950
want to participate in internet

00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:23,899
standards you can just do that it's a

00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:26,059
tough crowd though they're off on their

00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:29,570
tech if you and I learned this the hard

00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:31,909
way if you go with a with a half-baked

00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:33,369
solution you're gonna they're gonna have

00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:36,200
a bad time

00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:39,049
so tell you about my bad time later it

00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,729
was rather emotional yes it is a tough

00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:43,639
crowd but there is no there's no

00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:45,559
financial barrier to taking part they

00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:48,079
have three meetings a year and the rest

00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:49,909
of its done over email so it's and their

00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:51,229
remote participation for the meetings is

00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:52,789
very strong I've actually thought

00:26:51,229 --> 00:26:55,789
they've done some very good work in

00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:59,239
making it very accessible to people if

00:26:55,789 --> 00:27:01,909
you're not able to travel the money from

00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:03,169
IETF comes from a few different sources

00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:06,019
with the three meetings that they have a

00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:07,219
year there is an attendee fee I believe

00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:09,950
they also get some money from one of the

00:27:07,219 --> 00:27:11,079
large in Internet bodies as well yeah

00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:19,369
exactly

00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:20,839
and yeah so we are part of my

00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:24,789
international we're a Technical

00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:28,549
Committee of of that standards body and

00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:32,029
so they do have an exact calm which Joey

00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:33,469
is part of and there is a General

00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:34,999
Assembly meeting where they discuss the

00:27:33,469 --> 00:27:37,429
work of all the standards bodies but

00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:39,289
they've also given tc39 sort of a very

00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:41,719
free rein we've been given a lot of

00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:44,719
freedom to determine our process and how

00:27:41,719 --> 00:27:50,200
we work and they've also helped us

00:27:44,719 --> 00:27:52,429
define our our legal relationship with

00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,139
individuals who contribute things to the

00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:57,440
specification because this can be rather

00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:58,909
hairy for example in some cases in the

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,559
u.s. you'll have a company that says

00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:04,429
work that you produce on your free time

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,869
is licensed to the company and as a

00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:07,309
result we need to make sure that we're

00:28:05,869 --> 00:28:10,419
in a good legal position that we can say

00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:12,769
that if someone implements the tc39

00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:15,229
recommendation then they are legally

00:28:12,769 --> 00:28:16,999
allowed to do so then and that's that's

00:28:15,229 --> 00:28:18,499
an important legal protection which is I

00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:20,509
think part of the reason that we have

00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:22,069
the membership structure that we do so

00:28:20,509 --> 00:28:24,010
our membership structure is tiered we

00:28:22,069 --> 00:28:25,630
have ordinary ordinary members

00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,400
I believe that there are associate

00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,530
members there's another member who I

00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,470
think there's small business members and

00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:35,350
then finally NGOs and they have

00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:37,059
different tiers depending on on what the

00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:40,179
recoil what the funding requirements for

00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:42,549
ACMA that year are I think you raised an

00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:43,900
interesting point which is the impact of

00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:47,220
of IPR

00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:51,370
on our groups and on our processes and

00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:54,190
wendy is our legal counsel do you want

00:28:51,370 --> 00:29:05,380
to kind of maybe advise a little bit on

00:28:54,190 --> 00:29:11,320
that the importance of that I think we

00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:13,990
see a variety of approaches to IP the

00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:16,840
primary concern tends to be patents

00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:18,640
nobody wants to be writing a

00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:22,270
specification only to find out

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:25,390
afterwards that somebody claims patents

00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:28,840
on it and demands royalties from anyone

00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:32,190
who implements or uses the technology so

00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:34,570
different organizations have different

00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:38,340
requirements some have a disclosure

00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:41,440
requirement if you have or are aware of

00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:43,870
patents you need to disclose to the org

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,820
and the art maintains a record of those

00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:48,730
disclosures so that would be

00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:52,570
implementers can review to determine

00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:55,470
their own risk level and comfort with

00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:59,020
negotiating with those patent holders

00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:01,470
others have so-called Rand reasonable

00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:04,570
and non-discriminatory license terms

00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:07,210
where the patent holder can charge

00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:11,020
royalties so long as it's the same

00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:14,230
royalty to everyone and so long as it's

00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:15,640
reasonable which is something that would

00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:17,770
have to be determined in a court of law

00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,950
if the parties can't agree among

00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:25,500
themselves what a reasonable payment is

00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:29,919
and all the way to royalty free which is

00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:32,980
w3c policy that's saying anyone who

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:36,710
participates in the group commits that

00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:39,289
any of their so-called essential claims

00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:41,869
will be available royalty-free so

00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:44,899
anything that is necessary to

00:30:41,869 --> 00:30:45,799
implementation of the spec is available

00:30:44,899 --> 00:30:48,860
royalty-free

00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:52,490
things that are optional features or

00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:55,669
extra add-ons can still be licensed

00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:59,029
which opens up a business model of you

00:30:55,669 --> 00:31:02,740
know you have allow everyone to use the

00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:06,769
standard and you sell enhancements and

00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:08,840
companies do that and that's both a

00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:11,230
motivation to participate in the

00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:14,840
standards work get the core standard

00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:18,289
deployed everywhere and then convince

00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:23,950
people that you who know the technology

00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:26,629
are best positioned to add enhancements

00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:30,549
and if you want to pay for that

00:31:26,629 --> 00:31:36,350
performance upgrade or that additional

00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:40,940
feature so I think this tees up a

00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:43,009
question from tantek fairly well because

00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:45,320
you know that that's certainly accurate

00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:47,029
for what you just described as sort of

00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,649
the standard practice for for standards

00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:51,289
and other industries right but where on

00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:53,869
the web and we value the open web so the

00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:57,740
question is what are things that our

00:31:53,869 --> 00:31:59,690
standards groups are doing to make the

00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,820
standards process more open like how are

00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:04,490
we making it more accessible how are we

00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:07,549
making open standards licenses things

00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:12,820
like that you know more modern and open

00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:12,820
compared to the standards of yesteryear

00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:19,820
I'll start I think we work both the

00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:23,149
royalty-free end that the copyright

00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:28,190
licenses to permit anyone to to download

00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:31,700
our specs many of our recent

00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:33,919
specifications that w3 they use a four

00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:38,539
Keable license that is not using

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:41,210
copyright as a restriction on who can do

00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:43,399
other things with the license with the

00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:47,419
spec so if you think we're doing a bad

00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:49,700
job you can take the work elsewhere and

00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:53,420
we need to convince

00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:56,750
people that this community is the best

00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:58,790
place to keep doing the work because you

00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:03,580
know we don't have the legal code role

00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:06,110
to stop from taking it elsewhere

00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:09,260
with regards to sort of document

00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:11,630
creation and emails emails and ietf for

00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:14,060
the mailing list an ITF and w3c are open

00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:15,590
you can read them sometimes there's a

00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:19,130
little bit obscure to get there but they

00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:21,710
are available and you can see document

00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:23,690
creation from from the beginning some

00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:25,460
people will start to work on documents

00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:27,890
in editors drafts in their own github

00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:31,100
repository but once it reaches the idea

00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:34,130
or the w3c these documents are available

00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:38,170
to read from whilst they're being worked

00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:40,220
on that that happens and it's so

00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:44,060
advanced how things are done in the

00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:46,070
telco space for in telecoms standards

00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,810
bodies you need to log in to access

00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,580
things you need to be a member so you

00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:51,950
can't really see anything in some cases

00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:54,230
you have to pay to read the standard

00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:56,300
when it is done before it's sorry

00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:59,900
different this this industry and it's

00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:01,850
really great to see that that was

00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,110
actually one of the things I was really

00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,670
pleased with getting involved in the

00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:06,140
IETF and the OAuth working group was

00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,910
that I kind of just sort of stumbled

00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,919
into it by finding the mailing lists

00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:12,440
finding the people there starting having

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:14,390
conversations and then realized that I

00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:23,450
was I was participating that was it I

00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:25,310
had already joined but to your point

00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:27,770
it's something you kind of have to kind

00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:29,330
of either ghost actively searching for

00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:32,870
or stumble into and that's sort of a

00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:34,610
barrier and another for people getting

00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:36,409
involved you know another thing that

00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:39,710
I've heard that prevents people from

00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:42,200
from joining is sort of that reputation

00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:45,730
for spaces these spaces being kind of

00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:48,280
hostile and you know that's not great

00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:51,710
what are some of the things that our

00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:53,810
groups are doing to make to kind of

00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:56,000
change that to change that culture in

00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:57,290
the in the Indian community we have so

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,260
everything is out in the open everything

00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:02,540
is you know cc0 license everything is in

00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:04,700
public and we also have a code

00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:05,990
where we were expected to follow it if

00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,330
you're participating in this community

00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:11,090
and we hope people do that and it's very

00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:12,830
a very core part of it and the goal is

00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:14,600
you know to help create a space to feel

00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:18,470
people people feel welcome to

00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,870
participate and join and I hope it I

00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:22,460
hope it works

00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:25,670
speaking of the code of conduct since

00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:27,260
you sort of drive a driving force for

00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:31,100
that at tc39 can you talk a bit about

00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:33,980
ours uh yeah sure so um a lot of people

00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:36,140
don't know but we did about two and a

00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,960
half years ago at this point adopted

00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:41,480
code of conduct for tc39 the delegates

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,500
that attend the committee and that was

00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,990
really important because we were

00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:47,090
certainly getting a lot of you know

00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:48,830
feedback and certainly a reputation that

00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:51,980
it was a fairly hostile place and we had

00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:53,930
some some really stressful moments I'm

00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:56,540
really proud of how the committee has

00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:59,210
sort of turned around in terms of you

00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:01,130
know being willing to take that step

00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:03,560
which is a hard thing to do when we're

00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:06,050
consensus based group so we had to get

00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,310
sixty plus people to agree to that some

00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,950
of whom had a problem with that but

00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:12,350
that's fine because now we're moving on

00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:14,840
and it's you know it's been a really

00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:17,720
nice change I think slowly we've started

00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:20,480
to see more of the conversations kind of

00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,490
tempered down people you know

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,680
apologizing thanking each other like

00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:26,600
that kind of thing and kind of really

00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,760
resetting that tone for professional

00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:34,280
conduct which is great because that's

00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:35,930
what we need I know Wendy yep w3c has a

00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:40,340
code of ethics and Professional Conduct

00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:46,520
and a group that is working on revisions

00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:48,850
to that to improve the welcome there we

00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:51,910
also have had of recent interest

00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:57,470
introspection and work on diversity

00:36:51,910 --> 00:37:02,150
scholarships for our T PAC meeting to

00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:04,640
help people to to attend and to

00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:06,770
recognize that our community is not as

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,470
diverse as it could be there are

00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:11,630
underrepresented voices there are people

00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:15,530
for whom it's more difficult to get the

00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:18,210
travel funding together and so thanks to

00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:21,780
Danah focused at samsung for helping to

00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:24,720
spearhead that initiative we've had over

00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:27,300
the past two years the diversity

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,610
scholarship fund with member an

00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,860
individual support that's helped to

00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:35,850
bring I think this best year it was

00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:38,460
seven people to the T PAC meeting and

00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:40,650
you know all of that is to recognize

00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:43,440
that you know standards are only as good

00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:46,020
as the inclusive community that helps to

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:49,770
make them so I just realized we're

00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:51,480
already at 12:30 apologize I'm sure

00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:54,120
everybody would like lunch so let me ask

00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,820
one final question which is you know

00:37:54,120 --> 00:38:00,150
what can the folks here do to get

00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,530
involved with your communities what can

00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:04,890
you know if you were gonna leave them

00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:06,270
with one directive to come participate

00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:08,730
and get involved what would you ask them

00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,930
or tell them to do so I think it's also

00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:11,760
interesting to look at this from the

00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:15,060
perspective of because I don't think I

00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:18,300
think one place okay so context I ran a

00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:20,700
survey last year about asking developers

00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,950
what their relationship with tc39 was

00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,060
and how they wanted to participate and

00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:26,730
that actually shed a lot of light

00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:28,380
because from our perspective it was that

00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:30,000
everybody wanted to do proposals and

00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,040
everybody wanted to propose a change to

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,420
the language get a feature in but from

00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,860
the survey became clear that a lot of

00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,630
people were like well actually I want to

00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:38,580
help but I'm not too sure how or where I

00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:41,460
can start from I would love to write

00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:45,480
tests so in the case of tc39 you can

00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:49,980
check out our test 262 repository on

00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:51,570
tc39 doc tees 39s github page and there

00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,620
are lots of really friendly people there

00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:54,420
who will help you get started with

00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,980
writing tests other people were saying

00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,230
that they wanted to help with

00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:00,060
documentation and people were also

00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:02,190
saying I would love to give feedback but

00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:03,570
I don't know how and we haven't fully

00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:05,130
addressed this yet we're trying to get

00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:06,360
some documentation together this is

00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:08,490
something that we're actively working on

00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:10,920
to help people know how to give feedback

00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:12,840
and what we're looking for and things

00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:17,880
like this

00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:19,680
I'd say two places to get engaged any of

00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:22,410
our review groups if you're interested

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,770
in security or privacy or accessibility

00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:26,970
or internationalization we have reviews

00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:29,490
on all of those and

00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:31,710
I was looking for four people to help in

00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:34,770
doing those so-called horizontal reviews

00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:37,020
and if you have technical proposals or

00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:39,839
places you think the web could do better

00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:43,859
check out the strategy funnel where we

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:46,200
collect ideas and proposals and see

00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:49,700
either vote something up that's already

00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:51,720
in there or add an idea to the mix I

00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,369
would say the easiest way to get

00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,560
involved in the indie web community is

00:39:53,369 --> 00:39:58,079
joining the chat channel it's available

00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:01,859
on IRC slack matrix and discord all are

00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:04,290
the same room chat indie web org come to

00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:06,660
any web camp meet people in person and

00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:08,040
start talking about about what you're

00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,890
interested in and what specs you're

00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:13,079
willing to help develop or build things

00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:15,810
with it's very friendly community very

00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:17,819
welcoming and a lot of places - we have

00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:21,089
a new book coming up this weekend in New

00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:24,720
York and in two weekends and Brighton so

00:40:21,089 --> 00:40:28,619
lots of opportunities to join I'd say

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:30,960
for the w3c the ycdt owi cg web

00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:32,520
incubator community group is an

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,410
interesting one to join if you have

00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,329
ideas and to see what ideas are coming

00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:38,400
in from the community generally you can

00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:41,369
just join the mailing list and get the

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,250
emails from that the other thing is

00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:46,470
Startalk talking or speaking out vent so

00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:48,869
that's what I did I actually started

00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:50,819
being a bit of a fan person for service

00:40:48,869 --> 00:40:52,470
work I had a really locked onto that

00:40:50,819 --> 00:40:54,359
very earlier and it was because of the

00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:56,730
explainer document actually that Wendy

00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:58,770
referenced earlier and Alex Russell

00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:00,839
wrote this explainer documents and I

00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:03,599
started talking about that in the word

00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:05,190
that was happening there also just reach

00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,500
out to somebody on Twitter or another

00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:09,569
social media platform and there are some

00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,490
some people in standards who are

00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:13,200
desperate for people to help so just do

00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:14,819
that mental thing and just reach out to

00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,190
them and say I want to work on this they

00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:19,530
will be so happy that's so it's my desk

00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:22,859
and I want to share two quick references

00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:25,319
the web compat work from my taylors

00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:27,810
group is a great place to go check out

00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:30,290
how you can sort of get involved with

00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:33,440
like spec bugs and things like that

00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:36,020
and the other one is that that oh my

00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,720
gosh the web we want is another great

00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:42,890
place that's collecting ideas for you

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,570

00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:46,220
