Independent creators on the web today are increasingly forced into a handful of content platforms. Web Monetization is a proposed new web standard which provides an alternative to ads and site-by-site subscriptions. It has the potential to level the playing field between indie creators and giant tech companies.

it's actually a very long way to walk -

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:12,240
just to get on stage so I don't know

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,309
about you I'm still fascinated by tasers

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,609
talk I want to go home and try all these

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:20,460
things myself but I guess I have to do

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,740
this first so I'm gonna be talking about

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,800
something called web monetization

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,990
it's a proposed new standard that should

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,449
hopefully make it easier for creators

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,210
developers etc are to make money on the

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,670
web but before I get into that I want to

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,190
briefly introduce Who I am

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,250
so I'm a web developer for as long as I

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,200
can remember this is a fairly old photo

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,739
but as you can see I always wear very

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,090
formal things and I'm also never far

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:52,170
away from a computer because that sort

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,760
of been my passion and it you know I

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,739
treated computers while in computers

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,050
have treated me well I have I've been

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,180
very fortunate and I think I was very

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,609
lucky because I grew up in a household

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,799
where I had access to a computer and I

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,960
had fairly early access to an internet

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,240
connection and so there's a lot of

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,040
things I'm grateful for but one thing in

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,950
particular is that there were a lot of

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,630
really smart and really really dedicated

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,460
people that built something called the

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,430
web and a lot of the underlying

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,130
technologies that enable that and that's

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,040
really what's enabled me to to be

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,439
successful in build a career and this is

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,530
the very first website that I I made

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,630
commercially I got paid in a packet of

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,659
Magic the Gathering cards

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,430
it hasn't aged particularly well I was

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,570
amazed to find that it is still online

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:45,750
today the flash logo doesn't show up

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:48,600
anymore and frames aren't really in

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,850
fashion today but you know it still

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,399
works and as Tim berners-lee says cool

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,689
URLs don't change so I'm glad that's

00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:02,250
that thing's still online maybe I'll

00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:04,079
give them a free you know redesign you

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,039
know if I'm making a website today let's

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,950
say I'm really excited about you know

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,380
whatever topic blog or whatever

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,330
it's very easy for me to put my content

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,640
out there anyone can do it anyone can go

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,310
rent some server space or you can get

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,690
free server space and put some content

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,390
out there or I can upload it to any

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,270
number of platforms but if I want to

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,740
actually make money I have to go and

00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,110
work with one of the large tech

00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,420
companies or some really large content

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,820
platform it's very difficult for me to

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,010
go completely independent if I if I want

00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,620
to actually make a living off of my work

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,660
it's not impossible of course but it is

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,310
definitely very difficult and I think

00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,020
what makes it difficult is that there

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,020
isn't anything native in the web that

00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,570
allows me to make money it's always like

00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,940
something tacked on and I'll kind of

00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,800
illustrate what I mean so let's say I

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,330
want to make a blog about honey badgers

00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,890
because I'm just so fascinated with

00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,140
honey badgers they're the most

00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,450
fascinating animal to me and so I have

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,310
made a great website and it explains

00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,320
everything they need to know and

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,780
actually you know people really dig my

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,780
website and so the traffic's going

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,739
through the roof and suddenly Amazon's

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:19,110
starting to send me these bills with

00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:20,970
increasingly large numbers so you know

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,220
every month I get something like this

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,880
and it's like oh shoot this is starting

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,680
to be expensive and so now I'm thinking

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,930
about well maybe I can make some money

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,030
off the website and so the first thing

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,880
that a lot of us turn to when we want to

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,410
monetize our websites is advertising and

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,290
so before I know if my website looks

00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:42,900
like this okay maybe I'm exaggerating a

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,480
little bit okay maybe you can find some

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,400
less obtrusive ads but they're still

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,650
issues with ads even the ones that are

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,860
just textual there's a lot of tracking

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:55,290
that goes on they had a lot of external

00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,810
scripts set up including my page drains

00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,180
the users battery uses up their

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,720
bandwidth there was an article I read

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,910
where they looked at how much bandwidth

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,100
the ads take and how much money the

00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:10,560
publisher makes off of the ad and they

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,350
noticed that in a lot of cases the user

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,780
is paying more for the bandwidth to load

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:18,900
the ad than the publisher is making from

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,020
showing the ad which seems like there's

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,020
some

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,449
now of course you might say like okay

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,030
well ads are kind of an old hat anyway

00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:31,470
today a lot of people are starting to

00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,880
use ad blockers because of all these

00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,889
problems because they want to protect

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,270
their privacy and so we're kind of

00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:39,389
starting to move more towards like

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,770
subscription models so grandmother's

00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:44,310
coming out with a subscription right now

00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:46,770
everyone from Disney to you know your

00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,930
neighborhood blog is now having a

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,580
subscription a lot of independent

00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,470
creators are having subscriptions

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,600
through patreon and YouTube and twitch

00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,280
and other platforms like that and that's

00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,050
all great but I think at some point that

00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,110
gets very overwhelming for the user like

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,580
I don't know about you but I go to you

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,070
know consume content from probably a

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,229
hundred different people maybe even more

00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,820
every month and so am I really gonna

00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:11,940
have a hundred different subscriptions

00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,800
to support all of them probably not just

00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,080
subscribing and subscribing all the time

00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,330
would be a huge headache

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,639
and so maybe subscriptions aren't the

00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,710
perfect solution either and it seems

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,669
like people feel that way like this is

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:29,250
from a study but he basically looked at

00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:30,539
you know how many people are actually

00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,070
starting to be overwhelmed by the number

00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:34,289
of subscriptions and keep in mind that

00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,030
this survey was before a lot of these

00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:40,470
other subscriptions like Disney Plus and

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:41,970
others even came out so you know if we

00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,440
kind of take a step back and we look at

00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,710
the problem it's like what is really

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,960
going on here like why this monetization

00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,960
seems so difficult why does it seems to

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,449
a broken why isn't it just more seamless

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,729
and I think it boils down to a very

00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:59,340
simple thing which is the way that we do

00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:01,560
monetization is always out-of-band it's

00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,260
always roundabout there isn't anything

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,229
built into the web it's just we've we've

00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:09,419
we're building some ads and layering the

00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:11,160
amount of our website or maybe we use

00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:13,440
some traditional payment method that

00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,729
that you pay a subscription but there

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,380
isn't something that's sort of natively

00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:19,229
built into the web like really something

00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:21,360
that looks more like this where I get

00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:23,280
the content and I pay you some money and

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,979
both is going through open protocols

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,780
both this going through an interoperable

00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:32,610
protocols that are sort of universal and

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:34,229
globally accepted and and neutral in

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,849
in the middle that necessary is taking

00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:39,629
any any cut that's just sort of going

00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:42,900
straight through and you know you might

00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:46,020
aspect why are we using that and the

00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,669
first thing is that it's not that people

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,169
then think of this it's not like people

00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:51,449
didn't realize that this would be a nice

00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:53,460
thing to have for the web if you look at

00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:56,009
the HTTP back this is one of my favorite

00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,750
examples they actually reserved an error

00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:59,129
code for payment required and underneath

00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,719
it says does this reserved for future

00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:01,409
use as soon as we figure out this micro

00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:03,090
payments thing

00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:04,439
well we'll define it and it's been

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,860
thirty years and of course it's still

00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:11,490
not defined and so I'm kind of again

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:14,819
like why why why is it so hard and so

00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:16,379
about five years ago myself and a bunch

00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:18,539
of other people that you know we're

00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:21,240
interested in this topic we started a

00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:23,310
community group at the w3c it kind of

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,690
came out that what payments work which

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,449
you may be familiar if you're following

00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:30,509
sort of payment standards on in browsers

00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:33,629
and we started to think about like

00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:35,849
protocols for for for payments and

00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:37,740
particularly you know really solving it

00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:40,349
from a fundamental level because just

00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,090
making a nice abstraction of the PayPal

00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:43,110
API is probably not going to cut it you

00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,819
know like you're gonna have to have

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,219
something that you know phenomenally

00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:49,110
changes how how payments move the same

00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:51,210
way the internet changed how data moves

00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,099
and so we started working on this

00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,680
project called into ledger and the name

00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:57,659
is based on the idea that the same way

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,940
the internet abstracts you know which

00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:02,759
specific communications network you're

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:05,129
using allowing you to use any of them

00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,789
even create your own if you want and use

00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:10,110
it locally in your in your local network

00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:11,849
we wanted something that allows you to

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,979
use whatever payment system you want and

00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:15,180
still

00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:16,409
transact with people all over the world

00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,289
that might be using very different

00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:21,719
systems I was working in the blockchain

00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:24,569
space for a long time and so there are

00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:26,099
countries where cryptocurrency is banned

00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:28,169
and so they can't use any cryptocurrency

00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:30,180
and then there are countries where on

00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:31,469
the existing payment systems and the

00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,699
existing currencies have such high

00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,260
inflation that people don't want to use

00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:36,870
it and they actually turn to something

00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:39,390
like cryptocurrency and very quickly I

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,010
realized that you know you can't have

00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,919
one system that is going to satisfy

00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,290
everybody in the world and the elegance

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,940
of the

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,040
that is that you don't have to write

00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,290
like I can have my Wi-Fi and you can

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,290
have your Ethernet and we can still have

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,000
a Skype call right but nothing like that

00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,650
exists in payments and payments if I'm

00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,210
on PayPal and you're in reach at pay

00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:01,600
like you know you're gonna have a

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:04,020
difficult time and so yeah we started

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,190
working on this problem we actually

00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,450
started out thinking that it would be

00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,910
quite different than the internet and we

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,530
just wanted to have some very basic

00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,780
similarities like the idea that you have

00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:16,090
different people that are appeared that

00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:18,370
unlike a blockchain you would have no

00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:20,290
global state I think in the blockchain a

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,600
big problem is that everyone has to have

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,880
that global state and that makes it

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,220
again like a very complex system to

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,040
agree on and also very difficult system

00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,000
to scale and upgrade so we realized

00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,840
there wasn't going to be a block she was

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,360
gonna be more something like the

00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,520
Internet um but we didn't rise just how

00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,660
many of the concepts that make the

00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:41,590
Internet's are powerful we're actually

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:43,870
applicable to this problem and I'll give

00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:47,020
you just one example so for a while we

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,670
were trying to figure out how does a

00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,260
large payment go through the network

00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,820
versus a very small payment and just to

00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,940
give you a sense of this the differences

00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:57,190
in sizes you know we wanted to make some

00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,510
of these content payment use cases like

00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,970
you're reading an article you probably

00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:02,320
don't to pair more than a few cents and

00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,690
on the other end of the the other

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,130
extreme at the time was working for a

00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,620
company called ripple where we worked

00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,750
with banks and I had a conversation with

00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,820
somebody at a large bank and I asked him

00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,380
like you know what do you consider micro

00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,430
payment cuz maybe we're talking past

00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,230
each other a little bit when I talk

00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,840
about micro payments and and you know I

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:22,390
got that sense and they said a micro

00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:25,780
payment is anything under $10,000 and

00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:27,970
I'd say okay each other that's not what

00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:30,040
I mean and so you kind of have this

00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,330
insane range so you have you know banks

00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,680
that are moving 10 million dollar

00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,990
payments and then you have people that

00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,460
are trying to send 3 cents and what you

00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,280
quickly realize is it's very hard to

00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,980
design a protocol that can handle both

00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,990
and that's in some way similar to how

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,900
the Internet if it was designed for

00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:49,030
highly variable packet sizes that would

00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,890
have a huge number of very bad

00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:53,170
implications like if you if you're

00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:54,970
sending a two gigabyte you know IP

00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,200
packet and that gets lost you have to

00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,080
resend the whole thing that would be

00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,899
terrible and

00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,430
very bad and so we started to think

00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:02,810
about like well maybe we could do

00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,490
something similar for payments where if

00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:06,560
we have a larger payment we just split

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,000
it into lots of small packets and as

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,920
long as we can wrap all the individual

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,480
packets to the destination they can just

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,160
sort of assemble it and until they get

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:19,279
to right amount we even kind of copied

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,110
the the layered architecture of the

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,209
Internet so the Internet has these like

00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,860
different layers and there's kind of two

00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:26,660
models there's the Internet model itself

00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,880
which is actually less known and then

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,070
there's the OSI model which has a few

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,920
more layers I'm using the more

00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:35,480
simplified until internet model but

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,250
basically you have dick your Internet

00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,480
Protocol in the middle and our

00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,250
equivalent is called the in the ledger

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,380
protocol and that's just sort of a

00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,180
format for individual packets of money

00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:47,450
how do you express a packet of money how

00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,740
does it move through the system etc this

00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,290
is also where you would have a routing

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,670
protocol the intellect writing protocol

00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:56,750
is very similar to the internet routing

00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:58,540
protocol BGP and so you know you're just

00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:02,270
basically removing these packets around

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:03,950
and then above that you have kind of two

00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:06,110
layers one is the application layer

00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,459
which is pretty self-explanatory this is

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,850
like for different applications you need

00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:12,470
different interfaces and so you kind of

00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,810
optimize for your application on the

00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:17,089
application layer and that's where you

00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:19,940
get things like HTTP for the web and

00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:22,279
SMTP for email and so on in an

00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,959
intellectually we currently only have

00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:25,970
one application layer protocol which the

00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:28,190
first one which is you kind of think of

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,770
it as like a HTTP equivalent where it's

00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:32,660
like it's sort of a general-purpose

00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:35,180
moving money around kind of application

00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:37,160
layer protocol it actually uses HTTP for

00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,500
a lot of the security stuff to identify

00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,449
who you're paying and things like that

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:44,089
and then the next layer down is the

00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:45,199
transport protocol and on the internet

00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:48,290
and Internet world that would be your

00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:50,410
TCP or something or UDP and in the case

00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:53,149
of TCP what it really does is it handles

00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,740
retransmissions retries flow control

00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:56,180
like you don't want to send packets too

00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:59,260
fast so they don't actually get through

00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:02,470
they just get buffered and stuck and so

00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:05,120
yeah based on the similarities on the

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,560
interoperability layer we actually

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,300
needed a very similar transport layer

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,700
because we also needed to resend packets

00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,250
that fail

00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:14,580
and things like that and then underneath

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:16,440
the intellij layer well you know we can

00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,600
send these packets all day but no actual

00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,860
money has moved we have to you know I

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,070
don't want to say physically but we have

00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,900
to like really move money and so this is

00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,420
where you want to tie into existing

00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,920
payment systems right so maybe I have a

00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,930
bank account I want to do into legend

00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,420
from the bank accounts so I need to I

00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:36,060
need to use a settlement mechanism which

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,950
is a bank transfer or if you're into

00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,470
cryptocurrency you want to use that and

00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,850
so that's where you have these different

00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:45,000
implementations of how money actually

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:47,820
physically moves and so that's kind of

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,860
how the architecture is structured and

00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,790
what's nice about this is it's use that

00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,770
goal that I mentioned in the beginning

00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:55,590
where I can as a developer write an

00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:57,780
application at the very top layer which

00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:00,180
just says hey move some money from this

00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,830
person to this person you know to worry

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,360
if what people are using if they are

00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:06,900
using a bank account or mobile money

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,330
account or or a crypto account and even

00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,310
like a future new payment systems could

00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,840
tie into this and so you kind of you

00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,800
open it up for a lot of innovation if

00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,270
someone can come up with a better

00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,070
payment system they don't have to worry

00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,960
about you know getting a million

00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,420
merchants and a hundred million card

00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,130
holders before the system becomes even

00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,890
useful but rather they can deployed

00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:28,760
locally hook it into integer and

00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:31,860
immediately have a very useful solution

00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:34,920
and so just to can convince you that

00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,660
this is actually real so I started a

00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,150
company last year after we kind of got

00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,160
to a point where IntelliJ was pretty

00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:42,870
robust we thought but it wasn't really

00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,330
used in practice it was only in the lab

00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,460
and so since we started the company last

00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:49,350
year we've already made 100 billion

00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:52,200
payments now these are individual in

00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:54,330
Taleggio packets and it's kind of you

00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,280
have to think of it like you know the

00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,930
difference of going from a fax machine

00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,760
to the internet where like you know

00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,950
credit cards you're making very few

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,180
payments relatively speaking with

00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,580
something like int alleged you're making

00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,350
a lot of payments even per user and so

00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,660
it's it's literally orders of magnitude

00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:11,520
more payments that you can make because

00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,770
it's so efficient at sending very small

00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,970
payments and because when you're trying

00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,470
to send a large amount of money it

00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,140
actually might split it up into lots of

00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:22,540
small payments so it really feels like

00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:25,730
it's like there's an analogy here

00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:27,770
now I'm not talking about IntelliJ

00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:31,310
itself today I'm talking about web

00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:34,910
monetization so web monetization is as I

00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:36,860
said a proposed web standard and what it

00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,690
what it does is essentially uses

00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,980
intelligence as infrastructure so

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,089
IntelliJ allows us to send these like

00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,610
very small amounts of money very

00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:45,860
efficiently and it creates a browser

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:49,160
interface for it which essentially

00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,600
allows a user that's browsing the web to

00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,750
pay all the websites that they're

00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,130
visiting and it's you know been the

00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,200
weight of its implemented right now it's

00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,850
literally like every second you spend on

00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,940
the website it sends another very small

00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:03,950
payment a hundredth of a cent and so

00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,320
over time that adds up and so right now

00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:09,310
if you go by the hundredth of a cent

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,140
number that's thirty six cents per hour

00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:13,610
and that actually it's right in the

00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,550
range of what you might make with under

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,990
other monetization options and some

00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,700
people make a little bit more like video

00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,220
sites like YouTube make a little bit

00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:24,740
more but others make a lot less so for

00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,500
example podcasts we saw a number from

00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,450
Nielsen where podcasts are making around

00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,550
one cent per user hours so for them it's

00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:35,120
like 36 times more money than they would

00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,740
be making off of a user ordinarily and

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,650
so what you see here is a screenshot of

00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:43,270
a browser called Puma Puma is a browser

00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:46,459
for iOS and Android it's a fork Firefox

00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:49,279
and it builds a web monetization

00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:50,360
natively into the browser and so one of

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,890
the features that they have that's

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,260
really neat if you're first trying it

00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:55,370
out is it adds a little counter in the

00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,260
bottom left is probably a little bit

00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,150
small to see but it shows you in real

00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:01,190
time as you're paying the website that

00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,330
counter ticks up which is really cool

00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,360
and a lot of people look at that and say

00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:07,250
wow and so from the websites perspective

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,010
of course if if you--if one user is

00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,939
paying you you know two cents and of

00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,250
course right now there aren't that many

00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:15,350
users who are web monetized you're

00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,990
probably not going to make a lot but if

00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:19,640
this becomes more widely adopted you

00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,709
could quickly see how that those numbers

00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,890
start to add up and as you have more and

00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:27,920
more user hours you might make a decent

00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:30,090
amount of money and what makes this make

00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,820
sense especially for

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:34,920
the not the not the biggest size like

00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,630
everyone else the rest of us um is that

00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,160
it's totally linear right like you don't

00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,810
get more money just because you have

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,000
more traffic the way you do with ads

00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:44,520
because you have more buying power and

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,370
you have more you have more data on

00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,590
users and things like that or the way it

00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:51,420
works with subscriptions where if I have

00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,460
a huge content platform way more people

00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,710
will sign up and I will have much better

00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,030
conversion rates than if I have a small

00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,700
site where there isn't much content

00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:01,170
behind my subscription and so this is

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,310
really linear right like if I have a

00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,560
small website I'll just get

00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:08,720
proportionally less rather than getting

00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:12,990
a lot less so right now there is

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,880
extensions from coil for Firefox and

00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,700
Chrome and there's one browser that

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,860
implements it natively Puma if two weeks

00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,940
ago we were at t pack and we had a lot

00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,730
of really good conversations with

00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:26,400
browser vendors and so I expect there

00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,600
will be a few more several browser

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,160
vendors kind of reached out to us saying

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,560
like hey we actually seriously want to

00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:34,380
implement this a lot of people recognize

00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:36,660
that monetization is a big issue and so

00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:42,090
there's a lot of willingness to

00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:44,880
experiment same thing on the publisher

00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:46,370
side so there's a few early adopters who

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,170
are playing around with this technology

00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:50,850
one of them is Chris coy over at CSS

00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:53,010
tricks you can see what he's saying up

00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,440
there but it's definitely the kind of

00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:57,270
thing where like you know you very

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,010
easily can integrate it into your site

00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:02,490
and you're probably not gonna get rich

00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:05,370
today but it has that sort of magical

00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,660
feel of like I can monetize directly for

00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:09,660
my users I don't need to necessarily

00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,910
mini ads I don't need to you know build

00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,410
a whole registration system and let them

00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,540
sign up and all these kinds of things I

00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:21,960
can just put this like one little tag on

00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:24,450
my page and now I can get paid so how do

00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,790
you actually adopt web monetization as a

00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:28,770
web developer so the first step is you

00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,960
need to be able to receive into let your

00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,880
payments right so all these oldest

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,530
money's moving as in Taleggio packets

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,910
and so you need those packets to be

00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,830
received somewhere it's kind of like if

00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:40,320
you want to make a website you need a

00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:42,490
server that's on the Internet

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,920
and so that would be your step one

00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:46,570
and in the second step is you need to

00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,210
add the web monetization tag to your

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:52,180
website and that's essentially just a

00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:53,980
meta tag that tells browsers well okay

00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:57,370
if you want to support this website

00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:59,350
here's where you can send money and then

00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:01,780
of course there's a third thing you can

00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:03,670
do if you want you don't have to but

00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,590
that's where you actually can reward a

00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,910
user that is paying and give them a

00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:09,550
slightly different user experience

00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:11,800
versus a user that isn't paying examples

00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:13,780
of that would be turning off the ads or

00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,420
maybe you give them some extra features

00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,920
or you know some bonus content or

00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:22,480
whatever you want you can even show a

00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:23,830
little thank-you banner so we're going

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,510
the first step where can you get

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:28,390
intelligent wallet so right now there

00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:30,850
are three wallets that support into

00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:32,220
ledger and again keep in mind we just we

00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:34,330
launched our open beta and May so

00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,530
hopefully there'll be a lot more soon

00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:38,260
but these are the ones that are there

00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:39,790
right now as I'm giving this talk gates

00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,380
I've actually just launched today so if

00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:45,760
I'd given the talk yesterday it would be

00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:47,830
too so we think that there's this going

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,030
to be a lot more but the ones that we

00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,080
have actually cover a lot of ground

00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,510
already

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,160
so stronghold is a us-based provider so

00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,200
you can withdraw to a US bank account

00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,870
very easily you can also withdraw via

00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,360
international bank wire and the money

00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:03,040
accumulates and dollars gate up covers

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,840
the european region pretty well so if

00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,760
you have a european bank account you

00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,350
might want to look into github and the

00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,240
next repeated pod is a crypto wallet so

00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:15,940
you can actually withdraw into crypto if

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:17,740
you want so then the next step is you

00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,090
have your wallet and one of the things

00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,340
that you get from your wallet provider

00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,650
is called a payment pointer and it's

00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:26,140
that little thing with the dollar sign

00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:27,760
it's actually just an HTTP URL the

00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,620
dollar sign is just used to make it kind

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,860
of more recognizable as something thats

00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,060
related to into ledger and so you can

00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,220
think of it as sort of like an email

00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,780
address for money right so it's a it's a

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,090
place that someone can send you into

00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:43,060
ledger payments and payment pointer is

00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:44,890
actually referenced by the SP SP

00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:47,590
standard which is that application layer

00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:49,420
protocol that I mentioned previously and

00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:52,750
so all the meta tag really says is like

00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:55,929
hey this website monetizes with this

00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:58,119
wallet so if you want to donate or

00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:01,509
if you want to send that website a

00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:03,100
monthly donation or if you want to

00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:05,679
support it in real time the way that we

00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:08,289
do it at coil here's where you can send

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:13,899
money and it's really that's really all

00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:16,269
that metatag says and of course you may

00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:17,679
want to reward the user and so what that

00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:20,289
means it's like if the user is paying in

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,759
real time you are getting money and so

00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:23,350
you could say like hey I want to have a

00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,029
slightly different user experience for

00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,889
users that are actively supporting me

00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:29,169
and why would you do that well because

00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:32,129
that might encourage more users to sign

00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:35,619
up for web monetization and also

00:22:32,129 --> 00:22:37,570
providers like coil we may pay more if

00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:40,480
we know that a certain site is giving

00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:42,850
benefits so that's kind of our way of

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,379
incentivizing web developers to say hey

00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:47,470
we want to give benefits for web

00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:49,299
monetized users if you think this sort

00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,220
of through to the logical conclusion you

00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:54,850
could imagine it as almost like a an

00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:56,289
open-source Amazon Prime that that works

00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:59,230
on the whole web as opposed to just on

00:22:56,289 --> 00:23:00,970
Amazon owned websites so I get one

00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:03,639
subscription I can choose from a variety

00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:05,590
of providers and any of them give me the

00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:07,389
same feature which is I can go to any

00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:08,440
website I'm supporting the website and

00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:11,139
the websites giving me a premium

00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,669
experience that might not involve ads it

00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:14,529
might protect my privacy better because

00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:18,720
of that and it's not going to ask me to

00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:21,039
pay or get on a subscription and so

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,350
there's a simple JavaScript API if you

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,970
want to just listen for the browser

00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:27,159
telling you that it's paying but of

00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:30,220
course people can install an extension

00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:31,809
or just in any way modify the browser to

00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,029
simulate those events so this is not a

00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:35,769
secure way of doing it and so we

00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:37,320
recommend this way if you're just

00:23:35,769 --> 00:23:40,360
testing it if you're just trying it out

00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,769
or if you're the owner the benefits that

00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,899
you're giving aren't like hugely

00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:46,450
valuable or you don't care if people can

00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:47,860
can cheat so example would be if you

00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,779
show a thank you banner or something

00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,220
like that you know yeah people can cheat

00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:52,690
and get the thank you banner but you

00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,129
know who's gonna do that that's you know

00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,299
feels empty at that point if you're

00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:55,779
getting a thank you for something you

00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:57,669
didn't do

00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:58,990
so it depends really in the use case I

00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,249
think ads are another good example if

00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:02,049
you want to turn off ads you can probe

00:24:00,249 --> 00:24:04,509
overlap rely just on the JavaScript

00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:06,310
because you know people can already

00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:08,600
block your ads anyway

00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:10,100
but let's say you want to have this like

00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,140
let's say your Netflix and you want to

00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,400
give people the access to a huge content

00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,710
library you probably want to make sure

00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,320
that you're actually getting paid and so

00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:20,570
there's a way to do that which is first

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,180
step the user goes to the website so

00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:25,610
that's the same and so now you're

00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:27,590
serving that meta tag and now the users

00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:30,230
browser is actually starting to send

00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:32,360
money to your intellectual wallet and so

00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,990
the idea is that that wallet could then

00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,130
issue a JSON web token or some other

00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:39,770
cryptographically signed token that says

00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:41,120
okay this user has paid this much and

00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:44,480
now that could be shipped back to the

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:47,090
browser and now the browser can use that

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,340
to retrieve premium content from a CDN

00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:50,930
or something like that and there's lots

00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,690
of ways to optimize this and make this

00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:54,950
more streamlined but there is an

00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:58,160
implementation of it and there's already

00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:59,740
a couple of sites using it one site

00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:03,860
called cinnamon is sort of like a

00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:06,680
youtube / Netflix for web monetization

00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:09,440
so you never see any ads you get you

00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:12,860
know premium quality content but you can

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,020
also upload your own content and it uses

00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:17,150
this this kind of scheme so if you want

00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:21,680
to know how that works you can go to

00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:23,630
that URL now of course the big problem

00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,700
with any ecosystem whether it's open or

00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:28,100
not is you have to somehow get it

00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,920
started when you first start out there's

00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,480
no users there's no content so why would

00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,030
a content creator sign up why would a

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,310
user sign up and so we looked at that

00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:39,500
problem and you know as a company like

00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:41,570
we could have built a proprietary system

00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,300
but we feel like there's already plenty

00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:46,010
of those out there and they have way

00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,630
more funding than we have they live I

00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,580
think Netflix and invest something like

00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:52,400
fifteen billion dollars a year in just

00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:54,650
content and so obviously we can't

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:59,030
compete with that but we think that if

00:25:54,650 --> 00:26:01,160
we invest enough so that it's it's it's

00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:03,680
worth it for some developers who might

00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:06,320
be or also content creators who might be

00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:09,290
sympathetic to the idea of creating a

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:12,950
better world for for content in the

00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:16,250
future they might be you know we might

00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:18,020
be able to convince them and so we took

00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,330
some of the money that we raised to

00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,880
build

00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:22,230
company and we partner with Mozilla and

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,539
creative comments to give that money

00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:27,870
away to anybody who adopts a standard

00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:30,269
and what we hope this will do is create

00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:31,380
enough of an initial content base to

00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:34,140
make it worthwhile for some early

00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:37,950
adopters to sign up on the user side and

00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:39,600
yeah the way the brand works is each of

00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:41,820
the three founding members we all have a

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,460
representative on an advisory council

00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:47,159
and they vote on anything related to how

00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,200
the grant should be used and then we

00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:51,870
have a forum at forum grant for the web

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,700
gorg where we are interacting with the

00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:56,460
community to figure out what are some of

00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:59,309
the grant proposals that we should put

00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,750
out and so yeah if you're interested in

00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:03,659
a grant for the web I'd definitely check

00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:05,669
that out it's a hundred million dollars

00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:08,580
that we're giving away so um it's it's

00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:10,679
probably worth your time and so yeah

00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,000
that's pretty much it for me

00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,610
if you want to learn more about this

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,649
stuff so my company is called coil we're

00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:19,230
at Qualcomm you can also follow us on

00:27:16,649 --> 00:27:21,330
twitter under a coil that's sort of the

00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:22,799
commercial side that's where we're

00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,639
trying to compete with other providers

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,620
we're trying to provide the best

00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:28,019
experience we're trying to protect

00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:31,080
privacy better than other providers and

00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:33,480
we're trying to kind of make it as easy

00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,029
as possible for people to adopt and use

00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,549
web monetization grant for the web is

00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:40,799
like I said a partnership and we're

00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:42,990
actually looking for adding other

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:45,480
nonprofits that can cover you know

00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:47,519
specific topics specific subject areas

00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,899
so for example if we wanted to do

00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,240
something around journalism we'd want to

00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:54,929
partner with somebody that has a lot of

00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,500
experience with that area and so you

00:27:54,929 --> 00:28:00,450
know that's why we're keeping it at open

00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,710
project so if you want to know more

00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,809
about the Grand if you want to know how

00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:05,309
to apply things like that there's also a

00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:07,500
public charter where you can see what

00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:09,419
are sort of the the rules around the

00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,909
grant and how it's set up you can find

00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:14,309
all of that on Grant for the web org and

00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:15,649
if you want to stay up to date with the

00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:17,580
activities around the grant there's a

00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:19,200
place you can sign up with your email

00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:22,019
address where you will get any kind of

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,730
calls for proposals that it go out and

00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:25,830
also you can follow them on at Twitter

00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:27,389
as well and then finally if you're

00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:29,730
interested in web monetization as a

00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:30,880
standard you can go to web monetization

00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,740
at org

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,380
it's pretty bare-bones right now but we

00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:37,540
are building you know more resources

00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:40,420
like a way to generate the meta tag very

00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:43,270
easily a way to find wallets to sign up

00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:45,160
to and things like that the whole site

00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:47,290
is on github so if you want to make any

00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,670
changes or improvements to the web

00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,980
monetization that'll work where those

00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:52,440
are very welcome and yeah that's pretty

00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:58,569
much it thank you

00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:58,569
