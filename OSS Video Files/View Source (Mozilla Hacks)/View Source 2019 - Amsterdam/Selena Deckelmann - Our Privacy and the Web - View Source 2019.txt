 Privacy is the how we form our sense of self, become individuals and form relationships. It’s also how we form critical thoughts, and then decide whether we share them. Sometimes we invent technology that helps with this.

Mozilla’s founders believed privacy to be such an important concept that they enshrined it in our manifesto here. Mozilla Privacy Principle #4 is Individuals’ security and privacy on the internet are fundamental and must not be treated as optional. This principle guides much of the privacy technical work we do, balanced against social and political realities. 

This talk describes some of the work Firefox does to combat online surveillance and ensure user privacy and security.
