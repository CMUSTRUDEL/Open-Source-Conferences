 Privacy is the how we form our sense of self, become individuals and form relationships. It’s also how we form critical thoughts, and then decide whether we share them. Sometimes we invent technology that helps with this.

Mozilla’s founders believed privacy to be such an important concept that they enshrined it in our manifesto here. Mozilla Privacy Principle #4 is Individuals’ security and privacy on the internet are fundamental and must not be treated as optional. This principle guides much of the privacy technical work we do, balanced against social and political realities. 

This talk describes some of the work Firefox does to combat online surveillance and ensure user privacy and security.

[Applause]

00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:11,639

so I can see some of you perfect

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,100
so first of all thanks to the view

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,609
source staff for having me it's

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,590
wonderful

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,680
great great folks here and the

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,109
transcription amazing it's really great

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:29,880
being here in this venue it was like

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:31,500
been really inspiring actually so I you

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,329
know I got here yesterday and one thing

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,050
I'm noticing is that having a lot of

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:40,290
overlapping themes in our talks I also

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:43,860
will reference The Simpsons in a little

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:48,330
bit I have an anecdote about Mike Taylor

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,330
[Laughter]

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:56,809
really right and you know like all of

00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:00,359
the other presenters I love the web so

00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:02,579
you mentioned I've been working in the

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:06,360
open web since 1995 I saw my first web

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,560
page in 1994 and in its for the life of

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,689
me I've never been able to find this

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,960
page again but it was some mixed media

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:15,150
artist is really wild art I was going to

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,000
college and it just totally it totally

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,640
blew my mind and kind of like set in my

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,369
head that the web is just this wild and

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,100
creative place it's wonderful and it's

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:27,450
also this place for business which is

00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,210
interesting and a source of you know

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,400
some of the issues that we have today

00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:34,079
but it's also a place where people from

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,240
all over the world connect it's just

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,170
really an incredible political and

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,970
social experiment and the web enabled me

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,479
to see this story I don't know if you

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:48,000
saw this it was everything no it's a

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,369
there's a crime there's a jailbird and

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,470
there's a stale piece of bread and let

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:58,649
me just zoom in a little bit for a

00:01:52,470 --> 00:02:00,950
moment the story

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:04,630
the bird is in jail because

00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:07,610
its owner was caught in a robbery and

00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:09,200
the police didn't have a bird cage so

00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,819
they were like okay we'll just stick it

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,290
in the cell and give it some water it's

00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:14,840
a practice didn't know where to put it

00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:17,209
or whatever and then I just want to

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:25,970
bless the GD P R or the e privacy

00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:28,910
directions just like amazing so Diane

00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,799
hafsat is gonna give like a she's doing

00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:35,599
a conversation corner a little bit later

00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:37,640
about like VR and yeah and some of the

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,370
privacy issues but I just want to let

00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,200
you all know that putting a bar across

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:45,739
the eyes of a bird does not protect its

00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:49,220
privacy like you need to disguise the

00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:51,620
feather patterns the perching style the

00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,829
length of the tail the size and shape of

00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,299
the beak you know I just yeah anyway

00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:58,130
it's just not gonna protect it so if you

00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:05,060
want to put youtubers privacy we can

00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:07,940
talk later in the words of Bruce

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,790
Schneier I am a short term pessimist and

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,340
a long term optimists I feel incredibly

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:16,850
lucky that I get to work on Firefox you

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,170
know and the threats and problems that

00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:20,600
I'm going to talk about today they're

00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:22,549
really faced by everyone and many of the

00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,590
solutions that I'll talk about are

00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:26,600
things that every browser does or could

00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:30,709
do and some of the work that Mozilla

00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:33,109
does is uniquely us so in it Springs

00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:35,959
from our mission so the backdrop here is

00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:38,030
a web that is increasingly influenced by

00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,790
a big data and what people some people

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:43,130
call psychic psychographic driven

00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,019
marketing there's some fundamental

00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,359
questions that we need to kind of debate

00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:49,340
about this and I'm just gonna really

00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:51,769
scratch the surface here it's a it's a

00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:55,010
really huge topic but what I'm hoping

00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:57,139
here is to you know convince you that

00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,720
browsers are uniquely situated to have

00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:02,030
like a very significant technical and

00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,490
policy impact on massive data

00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:07,700
and we all have a stake and what happens

00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:09,200
next so before I can talk about the web

00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,170
and privacy though I feel like I should

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,240
explain how I think about privacy to me

00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,730
privacy is how we form our sense of self

00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,609
it's how we become individuals and form

00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:20,900
relationships it's how we like form

00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:23,290
critical thoughts and then decide

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,760
whether or not we're going to share them

00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:29,030
sometimes you know we invent technology

00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,800
that helps with this as a manager I

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,600
spend a lot of team time in meetings

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,080
with people who are like all over the

00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,640
world and we do that over video and

00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,160
we've had a lifelong problem controlling

00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,460
my facial expressions and reactions so

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,260
face me it's an amazing invention right

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:49,669
yeah we we have technology that assists

00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:53,840
us in every aspect of our interaction on

00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:56,180
the web so Mozilla founders believed

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,340
that privacy was such an important

00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,800
concept that they liked enshrined it in

00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,350
our manifesto and this is it individual

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,470
security and privacy on the internet are

00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,780
fundamental and must not be considered

00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,070
optional so this is the principle that

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,190
guides much of the privacy work that I

00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:15,050
do it's balanced against the social and

00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,240
political realities that we face and

00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,220
we're working probably we're working on

00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,260
developing products that demonstrate our

00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,479
worldview but also make effective global

00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:26,690
policy change that puts people's rights

00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:29,180
at the center but policy or sorry

00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:31,850
privacy is excuse me more than a

00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,950
personal right to choose in order to

00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,470
exercise privacy we really need to be

00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:38,930
free from surveillance there's this

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:42,110
great paper called what is privacy for

00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,640
by Julia Cohen and it's really available

00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:46,520
online you can just search for it and

00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,950
she this is published in I think 2012

00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:52,400
and she makes the argument that privacy

00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:54,860
is not just an individual right or

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,590
simply the right to choose to be private

00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,530
but that it's a collective right and it

00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,689
requires nuanced and sometimes

00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:10,959
unprincipled thinking in order

00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:12,819
to defend it so she also describes the

00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,919
purpose of privacy in a way that I

00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:17,489
fundamentally agree with which is that

00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:19,659
privacy ensures that the development of

00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:21,429
subjectivity and the development of

00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:24,669
communal values don't proceed in

00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:26,619
lockstep this is the source of creative

00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:28,809
tension behind change in culture and

00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:31,329
really making you a better world and you

00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:33,549
know it's like get very personal here

00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:36,969
like it's it's quite personal to me as a

00:06:33,549 --> 00:06:40,360
child of you know a Chinese man and a

00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:42,639
white American woman to me like without

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,929
freedom of expression freedom of like

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,539
privacy freedom of thought like I

00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:48,189
literally would not exist and it's that

00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:51,759
privacy and freedom also that enables

00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:53,979
Mozilla to exist in the world and one of

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,229
the critical definitions that Julie

00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:58,719
Cohen shares is that surveillance is a

00:06:56,229 --> 00:07:02,319
tension that is purposeful routine

00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:03,849
systemic and focused and the purpose of

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,429
modern surveillance and the purpose that

00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:10,449
I feel like I am fighting the most today

00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:12,969
is to reduce volatility and ensure

00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:15,039
sustainable profits you know government

00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:16,959
overreaches is definitely in a problem

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,579
but I believe that the existential

00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:21,249
threat that we have today are these

00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:23,499
systems that nudge the Tres smooth out

00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:26,110
profits and make people's behavior more

00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:28,869
predictable she calls this process

00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,879
modulation which is an extremely

00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:35,259
powerful tool to shape people's behavior

00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:43,059
and I watched this video of Alexander

00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:45,909
nicks from Cambridge analytic oh he this

00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:47,979
German marketing conference invited him

00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:49,479
to speak and it was just an amazing

00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:50,469
thing because then there was this panel

00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:53,019
that asked him if he was proud of

00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:55,119
himself at the end of the great so yeah

00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:57,819
he had an amazing answer you should

00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:59,729
watch it so anyway he repeated this

00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:02,379
claim that people are willingly as

00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:04,869
individuals choosing to share their

00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:06,270
personal information as inputs into the

00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:08,339
system that he

00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,050
and you know I think he's right to a

00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:12,330
point but where he's not right is that

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,039
most people really do not understand the

00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,740
conclusions that are being drawn or the

00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:19,499
feedback loops that are being created

00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:22,860
based on their personal information and

00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:24,869
you know anyway so so let's have a look

00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:29,369
what kind of things are pervasive

00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:31,830
surveillance used for so I'm an

00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:33,360
Instagram user I have a few friends you

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,800
know kids who SWAT flow you know who

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,139
have kids and we swap photos or whatever

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,380
and the system has decided that I really

00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:43,139
need a new pair of shoes and so I've

00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:47,160
seen the exact same pair of shoes like a

00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:49,470
hundred times it's showing me this like

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,720
hoping they'll buy and guess what one

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:56,220
day I found myself on their web sites

00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:58,259
typing in my credit card you know like I

00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,579
have like a personal rule like I'm not

00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:01,259
gonna buy shoes on the internet I'm

00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:03,420
going to like try them on my feet before

00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:06,690
like I you know you buy them or whatever

00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:09,750
but the the repeated presentation of

00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,220
this to me got me got me to move you

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,839
know got me to do that I didn't end up

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:17,100
buying them but you know I was very

00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:19,980
close close call so here's another

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,470
example of how that surveillance is not

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,810
sort of this network is functioning hi

00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:27,959
this is my Mike Taylor story so we all

00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,250
heard about creepy ads where people

00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,949
swear their device most of the most

00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:34,350
things then I was sitting like hanging

00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:36,060
out with Mike and his wife were here and

00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,709
he was telling me about this time where

00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,000
he was driving somewhere and you know

00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:41,790
they were talking about it like a place

00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,860
to eat and they were chatting and he was

00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,110
like how I better late get that you know

00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,699
the address on my phone and map it pulls

00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,399
up his map and what he found when he

00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:51,689
opened a map was that the address was

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,100
already there the place is already there

00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:57,070
and a little you know like bubble had

00:09:53,100 --> 00:10:01,230
been dropped like on the places

00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:04,839
but this this one is kind of similar so

00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:08,230
this image was sent to me by my friend's

00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:10,149
husband swelling and he had recently

00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:15,160
suffered like a pretty serious injury to

00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:17,980
his hand the next day he opens up

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,329
Facebook and it shows this ad which I

00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,120
don't know if you can tell it's Homer

00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:24,459
with a hand injury and it's like a

00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:29,500
poster that's like telling you to be

00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:30,759
more safe and as your sail so like I

00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,220
think what happened here because we

00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:35,230
don't really know right please some

00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:39,279
system in facebook had determined that

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:41,560
he had hurt his hand and you know then

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,850
somebody at Ranger had bought some sort

00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,470
of an ad maybe for people who have

00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:48,310
recently had hand injuries like I don't

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:51,160
know it's so weird but you know yeah so

00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:52,810
anyway so he ended up having this but

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,970
you know now in this interesting that I

00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,620
had this thought and I asked I asked

00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,850
some of my co-workers I was like do you

00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,850
think we could get even more specific

00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:11,560
haven't have you seen this the spinner

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:13,990
yeah it's pretty absurd and I'm you know

00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,690
we're pretty sure it's a parody because

00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:18,490
the guy that runs the site he's given

00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:21,279
some pretty outrageous interviews to a

00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:24,790
bunch of mainstream news outlets so the

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,199
idea is you can spend $49 and you can

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,240
buy some out of time that targets

00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:31,019
someone very specifically like one of

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,899
the ideas on there is like oh you want

00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:37,029
you want your family to be okay with you

00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:39,639
getting a puppy so you show them lots of

00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:41,649
like you know stories about great puppy

00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,150
stories there's another one that's like

00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:46,150
you want to influence your

00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:48,790
you know intended your your spouse to be

00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,720
to propose to you so there's that so

00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,240
there's all sorts of things and they

00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,610
they start out like pretty like you know

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,390
bad but mostly I said and and quickly

00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:59,620
kind of get dark so you'll see from some

00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,029
of the profiles that we know are

00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,690
generated I'm going to show you in a few

00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:03,850
minutes

00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:07,270
it's just really not out of the question

00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:09,550
that we could figure out how to buy and

00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:12,010
add and which parameters that we could

00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:15,190
use in order to ensure that we show them

00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:17,589
to a specific person and you know as you

00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:19,480
get you know overlapping categories

00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:22,240
you're gonna get more and more specific

00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,730
about a person and you could probably

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:29,020
make sure that you show them an ad that

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:30,610
you wanted them to see so you know all

00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,350
those are kind of goofy examples in the

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,740
spinner one you know it's probably not

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:37,690
real-world at this point but really

00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,580
those particular things don't really do

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,680
harm to people and I'm sure some of you

00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,380
may have a little more even extreme

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,670
views on ad targeting than I do but I

00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,650
wanted to take a moment to get out there

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:50,709
are a couple issues with this system

00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:52,690
that give me pause and and are not so

00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:55,990
amusing really and kind of motivate my

00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:58,450
work so looking back at those shoes so

00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,250
I'm a woman and those shoes that I was

00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,240
seeing out for were for women and it

00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,450
kind of makes sense that they would want

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,089
to target women for women's shoes that's

00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,170
harmless enough but you know it turns

00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:10,180
out that this kind of audience

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:13,660
segmentation can be used in ways that

00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:15,910
are actually quite harmful so this is a

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,130
pretty obvious case of abuse of

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:20,170
profiling Facebook letting job

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,640
advertisers only show advertisements to

00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,200
men and they were calling out uber in

00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,700
particular here there's this great

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,839
organization called Pro Publica

00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:30,220
that researches data abuse and they they

00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,470
put this out last year and they just had

00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:35,170
an OP date actually in the last like a

00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:37,120
couple weeks maybe in the last week they

00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,620
learned that the Equal Employment

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,480
Opportunity Commission which is a

00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,040
regulatory agency in the US and

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,160
investigated the claims that were in

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:47,260
there made by Pro Publica and was now

00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,620
forcing Facebook to restrict the use of

00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,870
job housing and a few other kinds of

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,030
admire so that they couldn't use this

00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:56,190
audience segmentation in the future it's

00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:59,250
actually kind of a positive ending to

00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:01,680
that story another reason why I really

00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,760
care about targeting is it has to do

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,520
with this thing called profiles of

00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:08,000
reference and here's a list of just a

00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,980
few possible profile categories that

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,150
advertisers can use and there's a link

00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,470
down there at the bottom to the full

00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,450
list which is kind of deserving if you

00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:17,400
look at all of it some of these are

00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:20,070
problematic alone but in combination

00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,110
they can be particularly concerning and

00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:24,390
these are conclusions that are drawn by

00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:27,090
algorithms about people and their turned

00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:30,150
into a very terse label for advertising

00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:33,330
they can be eerily accurate and about

00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:34,230
extremely personal things you know and

00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,670
some of these profiles are being

00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,670
generated and used for real-time

00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:40,980
advertising of course and we could

00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:43,320
assume that all the advertisers you know

00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,910
have our best interests in mind and that

00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,500
they're only showing us ads for things

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:49,710
that are gonna help us with these

00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:52,680
problems but we know that we are in an

00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:54,180
adversarial situation right now for

00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,630
people who are buying ads as well as

00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:00,060
like their use of social media and these

00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,680
systems that people are buying ads they

00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,230
don't really try to get you to buy shoes

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,840
anymore they're lying about who they are

00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,880
they're faking information they're

00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,830
trying to influence political views and

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,990
they're influencing elections so

00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:14,670
stopping the data collection that leads

00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,980
to the generation of these profiles

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:22,530
being useful is definitely part of the

00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:24,750
work of my team so given all that how

00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:25,890
does it the Firefox helps any of this so

00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,060
I want to say some of the things I'm

00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,130
going to talk about like I said earlier

00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,770
they're really things that are part of

00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:33,060
every browser or could be and I think

00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:36,540
about this in the combination of

00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:38,040
ensuring like basic security preventing

00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,230
surveillance fighting surveillance and

00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:44,550
finally establishing better defaults and

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:46,170
educating people about what they are so

00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:48,120
the first thing that we have to ensure

00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,250
is that we maintain security for users

00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,660
despite the fact that you know the

00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,550
browser is this place where we run

00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,440
untrusted code for people that we don't

00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:58,290
know and we just kind of like hope for

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,080
the best hope maybe underselling it a

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,850
little bit but there

00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,880
like a ton of really great work that

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:05,350
goes into this and here's some just big

00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:09,550
areas this is just like kind of like a

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:11,080
high-level selection of topics there's a

00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,450
lot more that goes into this but you

00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,010
know thinking through like the basic

00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,750
security things that need to happen in a

00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:19,900
browser we have to have OS level

00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:21,580
sandboxing and this is to restrict

00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,750
access to api's that could be used and

00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,060
be used

00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:27,130
we need process level isolation of sites

00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,600
this is Specter meltdown I'm it's called

00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,490
site isolation in chrome and our project

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,830
to do this in Firefox is called the

00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:35,380
fission we fixed the ton of security

00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:37,170
bugs in just about some general and we

00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:39,070
use the Safe Browsing API which is

00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,930
something that Google maintains to

00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,730
prevent users from accidentally visiting

00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:44,170
malware and phishing sites phishing is

00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,950
one of the bigger problems that faces

00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:51,250
like regular users today we also write

00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:54,370
things in rust just awesome of course

00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,570
sometimes you rewrite things in rust one

00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:59,010
thing that we're implementing from

00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:01,600
scratch today is a cp3 or it's a quick

00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:04,270
and it's just starting to be integrated

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,650
now and we're really thinking about like

00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,670
another thing I didn't put it in the

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,530
slides but we're thinking about web

00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:10,630
assembly as well as something that we

00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,130
can use like not just like to deliver

00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,080
applications but actually in the browser

00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,690
maybe in a sandbox their party

00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,640
applications and honestly like I said

00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,050
there's there's a lot more here both in

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,630
terms of like standards development

00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:24,360
implementation our build process and you

00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,740
know things like our collaboration tour

00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:29,170
but you know most of the other browsers

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:32,020
do many of these things or most of them

00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:33,640
and at this point we all we all do that

00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:37,150
because we all take security quite

00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,220
seriously so once we secure the browser

00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:41,440
we have these privacy features that we

00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,000
implement and you know those features

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,880
don't exist in a vacuum they're often

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,920
accompanied by policies open processes

00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:52,120
and maybe even a community to support

00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:53,650
them so tracking protection this the

00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,820
original version of tracking protection

00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,410
has been in the browser for quite a long

00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,550
time you know this is one of the ways

00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:00,400
that we fight surveillance in the

00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,990
browser Safari has ITP and I think just

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,970
talking about ITP as well which is like

00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,180
a local machine learning approach that

00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:08,720
we think is really cool

00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:10,040
approaches list-based and and you know

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,790
doesn't doesn't involve machine learning

00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,430
good

00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:15,950
so what tracking production does is in

00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:17,750
its most strict form is it actually just

00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,920
doesn't load the trackers it blocks them

00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,480
at the network level it's in this

00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,840
component called Necco that it blocks

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,060
them and in its least strict form it

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,660
simply blocks the trackers from having

00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:33,380
read access to data about a website and

00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:35,540
we may also strip cookies for trackers

00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:40,910
that we find are evading our policies

00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:43,460
which which has happened and we operate

00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:46,580
the system you know by working with a

00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:49,160
third party disconnect and they create

00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:51,020
and maintain these lists and they've

00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,880
established a criteria that you can see

00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,890
and read on their website and an

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,250
accountability framework for dealing

00:18:54,890 --> 00:19:00,740
with you know incorrectly added sites

00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,300
and things like that so this is one of

00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,250
those examples of us combining a

00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,590
technology with a transparent and

00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,240
accountable policy approach you know

00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:11,060
that underpins just about everything we

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,140
do so another thing that my team works

00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,300
on is this thing called the

00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:17,450
certification Authority route program

00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:20,180
and the common CA database this project

00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:22,610
is run as like a radically open forum

00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:24,950
that manages which organizations are

00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:27,800
trusted by Firefox to serve SSL and TLS

00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:29,690
certificates so our program is

00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,520
considered you know the gold standard

00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,770
honestly for deliberative and open

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,240
processes in this industry and there are

00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,770
many organizations that just simply

00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,960
follow our lead or wholesale use our

00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:40,220
route list in order to secure HTTPS and

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,590
their you know whatever it is open

00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,960
source project product whatever and no

00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:48,020
other trust program is open like ours

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,060
it's kind of amazing actually you get to

00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:52,400
see the people who administrate this

00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,810
program calling out CAS and telling them

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,950
they screwed something up and then a

00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,540
bunch of people on the internet piling

00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:02,540
on and anyway I don't know mailing list

00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:03,520
is great but anyway our our policies

00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,290
about trust and

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,700
ability and transparency they really you

00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:08,350
know like I said they underpin the

00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:13,540
security of HCPs

00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:14,950
through this program another area of

00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,560
work that we do that I don't know is

00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:19,960
this obvious is Internet Protocol work

00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:23,800
we have several people who are highly

00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:27,490
engaged with the ITF and TLS 1.3 and DNS

00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:29,380
over HTTPS or doe both network level

00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:32,380
protocol changes to the internet that

00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:35,890
improves security TLS 1.3 is also like a

00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:38,340
really improved performance and the

00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:40,450
changes from 1.2 to 1.3 made it

00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,980
significantly harder to intercept and

00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:43,360
control web traffic so there was

00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:47,260
actually a lot of pushback when it was

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,990
being created DNS over HTTPS or doe like

00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,310
I said is another internet protocol this

00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:56,590
was a little more controversial right

00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:58,120
now and what would it basically is is it

00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,640
takes DNS requests and tunnels them

00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,100
through HTTPS and what's interesting

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,560
about this is it takes DNS which has

00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:08,040
traditionally been a text-based protocol

00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,690
the plain text protocol and encrypts it

00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,130
and it makes it by tunneling through

00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,460
HTTPS that makes it much more difficult

00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:18,250
to filter or eavesdrop on so Firefox

00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:20,710
approach to this rollout is different

00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:22,720
than Chrome's and what we've decided to

00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:25,120
do is combine a very strong policy

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,250
approach which limits the storage of DNS

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,530
data to 24 hours and ensures

00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,480
transparency and accountability for any

00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,760
blocking like sanu you know either

00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,500
censorship or you know it could be some

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,660
other kind of blocking but ensuring that

00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,370
there's transparency to that so that

00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,570
people actually know that things are

00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:45,550
being blocked because that's not the

00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:47,560
case in a lot of places today so anyway

00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:50,050
we're taking this roll out quite slow

00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:54,010
and you know initially it's only gonna

00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:56,380
go to the US but we're working to find

00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:58,600
good trusted recursive resolver partners

00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:01,390
throughout the world right now and our

00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,070
hope is honestly that this protocol gets

00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:05,140
deployed everywhere because it's going

00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,860
to significantly reduce surveillance

00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,860
throughout the world

00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,580
so we're also working on this thing

00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:15,390
called private a Firefox private network

00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:19,390
supposed to be like a like betta name

00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:21,669
but you know we'll see it'll probably

00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:23,919
have a name when it is actually fully

00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:25,390
released right now it's in just testing

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,830
phase and it's it's free right now but

00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,929
we probably aren't going to charge some

00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:31,659
nominal fee for it later for the

00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:35,250
operating costs of it it's currently

00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:37,539
structured as a secure proxy that just

00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:40,000
proxies everything in your browser to

00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:42,820
the third-party and our goal here is to

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,250
provide protection to users by hiding

00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,990
their IP address from trackers providing

00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:49,539
this is part of a layered approach to

00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,919
security where we're enabling tracking

00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:52,330
protection by default continuing to

00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:54,340
implement other privacy enhancing

00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,260
features that reduce surveillance and

00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,960
helping people hide their IP address

00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,370
while they browse which you know the IP

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,260
addresses are a significant source of

00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,789
unique identification for users because

00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,409
honestly most people's IP address

00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:09,880
treeling their homes they don't change

00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:11,559
over time so the last bit of anti

00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,049
surveillance work that we do is to

00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:16,510
educate people about it in the product

00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:18,220
as well as with like publications and

00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:20,260
papers and things like that but I'm just

00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,789
gonna show three things I already kind

00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:25,899
of did this like massive laundry list of

00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:28,029
tech when I was like preparing for this

00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:30,700
talk like we we probably need like a

00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:33,190
central place where we would list these

00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,510
things so I'm gonna take that upon my

00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:37,510
supposed to do that when I get back home

00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:39,070
you know after the conference though so

00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,450
here's just three three things that came

00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:42,070
to mind what do you thing that you'll

00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,389
see in nightly in beta today is our

00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:46,059
enhanced tracking protection or

00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:48,309
sorry.just protection report this shows

00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:49,510
you how many trackers have been blocked

00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:51,549
by your system and it provides some

00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:53,889
links to additional information you know

00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:55,149
this is this is more for like just you

00:23:53,889 --> 00:23:56,559
know regular people that are using the

00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:58,090
browser and they're curious about like

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,090
what is happening with tracking

00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:03,940
protection anyway we're adding more

00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:06,340
support to this tool over time and it'll

00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:09,039
you know include support for services

00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:11,049
that we operate something that the

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,730
Mozilla Foundation works on is called

00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,590
the Internet health report they pick

00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:16,450
different topics each year but

00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:18,460
surveillance was a big part of the 2019

00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:20,340
report and these are just these short

00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:23,400
pieces that are collections

00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:25,260
Flay primary sources to give people like

00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,610
a fast way and like a summary give

00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,770
people like a fast waiting get an

00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:30,570
understanding of the topic I think it's

00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:32,909
actually pretty valuable you know to

00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:34,890
just get people to understand these like

00:24:32,909 --> 00:24:37,230
big complex things that take a lot of

00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:41,190
time to research it you know you don't

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:44,100
really have a guide and do it I also

00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:46,320
wanted to share Firefox monitor this is

00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,240
a service based on have I been poned

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,440
yets database which is like the greatest

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,720
name for business ever and what it does

00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,240
it just alerts you if your email address

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,940
has been hacked and you know compromised

00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,700
through a website breach you know so

00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:06,929
when websites get breached often the the

00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:08,580
breach data gets posted somewhere and so

00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:09,870
you know this particular service goes

00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,240
around looking for that and then if they

00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:14,159
find it they let you know so you know

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,690
the the purpose is just to really help

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,490
people with a very common problem which

00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:20,730
is like okay everybody's like what do I

00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:22,770
do and also you know sometimes you don't

00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,299
get informed in a timely manner on these

00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:26,190
breaches we've occasionally you know

00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:29,090
gotten information before you know

00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:32,100
people were informed by the company so

00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:35,370
anyway we support multiple contacts you

00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:37,049
know or sorry email account email

00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:38,490
accounts to be monitored in a single

00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:41,100
Firefox account and we send out those

00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:42,630
alerts when new breaches happen so we've

00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,950
had about four million subscribers in

00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:45,600
the service and it's it's when our

00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:49,679
remote popular things that we've been

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:51,000
working on lately so I put a note in

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,059
here to note that we're close to the end

00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,230
whoo okay so just a few more slides and

00:25:54,059 --> 00:26:00,600
you know I just wanted to say privacy is

00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:02,730
really essential to being human you know

00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,220
it's it's how we growing to change and

00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:07,950
make the world a better place and the

00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:10,110
web is as part of our world you know so

00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:13,820
I really believe that privacy is

00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:16,440
essential for being a human on the web

00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:19,350
but what we know is that the web really

00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,760
wasn't designed with privacy in mind it

00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,299
really wasn't designed with surveillance

00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,640
in mind

00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:25,360
it really wasn't designed thinking about

00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,790
the threat model at all really

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,610
and those thread models have evolved and

00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:32,860
we're still trying to catch up and I I

00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:35,320
really think that we now need to disrupt

00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:37,270
this system that's emerged and we need

00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:41,590
to protect everyone not just ourselves

00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:43,690
you know but you know well we do need to

00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:45,610
protect ourselves checking myself from

00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:47,740
buying us recursive shoes that we don't

00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:50,320
need we need to protect people from

00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:52,990
being discriminated against for jobs or

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,370
housing and you know I also think we

00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:56,260
need to protect people from having our

00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:59,050
essential selves being labeled and

00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:01,360
nudged you know in these scary and even

00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:05,650
dangerous ways with these feedback loops

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:07,860
in advertising systems so what can we do

00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:10,090
what can we do to help preserve privacy

00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:13,720
well I really believe that browsers

00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:15,820
provide this very understandable way to

00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:19,240
like very understandable privacy Pro

00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:21,370
properties to people and we can fight

00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,350
surveillance right in the browser and

00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:25,780
have a sustainable future for the web

00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:28,510
that's what I believe anyway Firefox

00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:30,580
does a lot here on a tech and policy

00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:32,560
basis and other browsers do a lot to you

00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,900
but I really think we could all do more

00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,880
and we can do more through encryption

00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,700
like the protocol level there's there's

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,960
lots more to do there like there's a

00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,270
standard called ES and I that I hope

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,950
that that we get through as well that

00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:48,610
would encrypt the last kind of a bit of

00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:50,280
unencrypted DNS information we can all

00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:53,230
do this through policies in the browser

00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:55,090
standards and and also by blocking

00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:59,050
harmful tracking and enabling user

00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:01,750
choice so I believe that every person or

00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:04,180
company also can take action to reduce

00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:06,220
the amount of data that we collect so

00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:08,440
Mozilla has a site that describes our

00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:10,900
lean data practices our data stewardship

00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,830
programs and we welcome anyone like if

00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:15,790
you scroll to the bottom there's like

00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:18,100
this link that's like click to talk to

00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:19,540
us about lean data like we love to have

00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,650
those conversations we have people that

00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:26,080
go out and give talks and things like

00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:29,140
that organizations about this and what

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,940
about our future okay no inlet are we

00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,230
shared yesterday you know this

00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,480
ever-expanding world and phones

00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,830
everywhere you know

00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,260
I need your phones with some of them

00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:39,059
phones with apps we're gonna have these

00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:43,380
phones with apps so so what are we going

00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:45,570
to do about those well we know that apps

00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,250
are invading people's privacy basically

00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:50,340
without restraint at this point and

00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:52,769
unlike the browser there's only these

00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,480
like monopoly like app stores that are

00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:58,230
controlling the policies and the

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,370
gatekeepers for this you know they're

00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:02,070
the ones that are reviewing these apps

00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:04,110
and and checking for violations and I

00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:06,600
you know we don't really have like a set

00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:08,820
of policies that that makes sense right

00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,409
now I think we're really in this Wild

00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,970
West stage and I honestly think it's

00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:27,779
gonna get worse before it gets better so

00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:32,639
I just I want to close with this this is

00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:34,169
my second Mike Taylor I was about this

00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:37,139
and he was like oh man after you talk to

00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:41,220
me I installed a couple apps so yeah all

00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:43,460
right yes Mike has my back and just you

00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,870
know we don't we don't have to accept

00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:48,149
ubiquitous surveillance and mass data

00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:51,090
collection as inevitable like we can't

00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:52,049
stop it and even the little bits that we

00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:55,350
do to stop it

00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:57,299
do help it disrupts it and I think the

00:29:55,350 --> 00:30:00,899
way you gotta think about this is what

00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:03,389
kind of a future do you want we are

00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:05,940
right now on a path to a modulated one

00:30:03,389 --> 00:30:08,250
you know it's going to be modulated by

00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,320
ad tech and profiling it's already

00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:12,269
happening it's happening today and so

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,519
I'm asking you you know honest all those

00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:16,740
apps use the browser especially in the

00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:18,899
mobile web you know support p.w ways and

00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:21,419
alternatives I know one features

00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:22,919
acquired here on that but they still

00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:24,299
think it's important to say I think it's

00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:26,370
important to say to a lot of different

00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:27,899
audiences you know of course I'd love

00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:31,320
for you to pick Firefox but really I

00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:33,000
know you just choose the web it's really

00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,810
worth your time to think about what

00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,720
happens

00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:38,610
this ecosystem and I'll just say you

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,420
know we're hiring you can join us in

00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:48,369
this fight so yeah thank you very much

00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:48,369
