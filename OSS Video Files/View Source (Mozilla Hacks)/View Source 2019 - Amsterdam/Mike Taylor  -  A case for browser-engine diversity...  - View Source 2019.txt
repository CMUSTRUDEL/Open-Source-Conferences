Given the recent demise of Presto and EdgeHTML rendering engines, and dominant market share growth for Chrome (and its Chromium engine), can we make a case for browser engine diversity in a decreasingly diverse browser engine world? In this talk, weâ€™ll talk about web compatibility, interoperability, the web standards process, and hopefully conclude that we should care about these things in 2019.
