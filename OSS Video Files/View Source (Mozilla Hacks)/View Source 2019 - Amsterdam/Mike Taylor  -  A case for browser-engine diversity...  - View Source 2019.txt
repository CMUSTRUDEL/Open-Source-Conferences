Given the recent demise of Presto and EdgeHTML rendering engines, and dominant market share growth for Chrome (and its Chromium engine), can we make a case for browser engine diversity in a decreasingly diverse browser engine world? In this talk, weâ€™ll talk about web compatibility, interoperability, the web standards process, and hopefully conclude that we should care about these things in 2019.

hey everybody hey is that Bruce cool

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:26,310
so um next don't have to do anything

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:29,550
special gets quicker to behave this is

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,210
30 minutes of my talk asking for help

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,210
about the clicker

00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:43,680
is this be seriously using Chrome for my

00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:43,680
talk that's cool

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:55,629
Zoe okay here we go so so let me just

00:00:54,309 --> 00:01:10,539
introduce myself I'm Mike Taylor in the

00:00:55,629 --> 00:01:12,580
lead graphic designer for Mozilla okay I

00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:14,200
just want to be really clear like it

00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,220
during my hot today like I'm not part

00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,530
with a little girl like I don't

00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,320
officially speak for Deverell like more

00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:23,110
of a Rudy Guiliani shadowy foreign

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,100
policy situation where I'm gonna say

00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:28,569
some things and if they're true that's

00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:34,330
great if they're not true like the my

00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:36,880
opinion but so so just a little bit

00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,860
about me I work for Mozilla I've worked

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,189
a little bit with standards and web

00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,930
compatibility I help with the website

00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:45,909
called webcam which we'll talk about

00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:52,049
later maybe where you can go and learn

00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:52,049
reporting on websites but

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:12,989
cool hey that's too early here we go

00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:16,170
I remember where this isn't a talk

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:19,170
anyway so so Bruce Lawson nine years ago

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,880
was this about we wrote we wrote talked

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:24,230
together called introducing WebSocket it

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,230
has nothing to do with my talk today

00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:34,230
much more I assured that should I be

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:44,880
pointing the clicker in any direction

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:50,459
that way down hey cool okay so so let's

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:51,750
restart the time so let's try to

00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:53,250
actually get into the talk right well

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,010
we're gonna talk about today's I'm going

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,120
to talk a really quick little

00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:00,180
introductory history into browser

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,340
engines and we're going to talk about a

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,489
more recent history and then I'm gonna

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:09,900
tell you why I will convince you why I'm

00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:11,910
right diversity is good and so to set

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,720
the stage here like 1993 raise your

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:17,920
hands if you were alive

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,050
it's pretty good it's pretty good

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,970
so like the really what grounded me when

00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:25,720
I was preparing this 1993 was the year

00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:28,880
that Tim berners-lee

00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,410
open-sourced the world wide web or Nexus

00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,940
web browser source it been in

00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,110
development this was kind of like the

00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,930
first web browser been in development

00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:41,180
for a few years but this was when it was

00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:43,790
unleashed 93 Ace of Base I saw the sign

00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:49,840
like that's what carotid me helped me

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:49,840
connect with the web really good song

00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:57,470
1993 is also in mosaic became a thing

00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,270
this was a research project that

00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:04,460
eventually turned into a commercial

00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:07,010
thing so that's the mosaic logo that's

00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,690
that browser engine was licensed by

00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:11,690
Microsoft it turned into the first

00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:13,160
version ie the mosaic people went

00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,990
started their own company and rewrote

00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,859
and was a effectively in turn into

00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:20,180
Netscape we can actually I'm going to

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:24,560
need some help there I look like this

00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:26,890
can can the slide operator individual

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,730
click on that little sparkle sling

00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:32,540
button the top left on the screen please

00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:39,560
we're gonna watch something that again

00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:40,760
very slowly you go awesome got it okay

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,460
so we're gonna we're going to look at

00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:46,680
the growth of early browser engines does

00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:52,030
it click here we go

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:55,419
got excited that so so Netscape existed

00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:56,740
it was massive mosaic got tiny ie got

00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:58,480
big so this was kind of like the very

00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,740
first kind of Wick browser more

00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:06,130
situation where we'll talk about that

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,330
later what that means but okay so does

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,910
anyone recognize this thing on the left

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,230
raise your hand this is comforter right

00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,820
this was kind of the very first

00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:21,729
open-source web kit ish thing it turned

00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:24,610
into Safari kind of so so here's a

00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:28,060
little just history lesson for you in

00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,680
this society so HTML if you've ever

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,320
looked at the user agent string of a

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,350
Chrome browser or any browser or a lot

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,710
of other browsers it'll say KHTML common

00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:43,060
like their code where that comes from

00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:49,389
HTML comes from the cage tml w library

00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:51,850
which was the KDE HTML widget which

00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:54,820
comes from cool desktop environment HTML

00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:59,650
rights over k HTML you have to pronounce

00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:04,020
it cool HTML raise your hand here to do

00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:04,020
that that's weird

00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:12,090
parkour linux nerds

00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:15,250
it's a few over there over there okay so

00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:18,340
okay another another interesting fact

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:22,300
which is also slightly weird is this is

00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:24,729
a photo view of 98 fault once it fell

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,220
Tamara's gotta which is a building in

00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:28,750
Austin or wing on the fourth floor there

00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:34,570
were two companies one was trolltech

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:36,220
which made cute and KDE and convert also

00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:38,680
on the fourth floor was Opera Software

00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,030
and so they develop their own rendering

00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,460
engine

00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:44,420
presto so you had coming off like the

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:47,280
same the same building floor two

00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,720
influential web browser engines it's

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,040
kind of mysterious I think they shared a

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,570
lunchroom it's like if you take the door

00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,070
on the left you go up and soars if you

00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,130
take the door in the right place you

00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,570
don't

00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,580
so the Netscape folks they eventually

00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:06,990
started working on this open source

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:08,400
browser called Phoenix before they found

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,080
out that it was like there was a

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,550
trademark or copyright and so they're

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,810
reading that thing in the Firefox and

00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:17,850
this is how you're not gecko so this is

00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:21,390
not the Wizard of Oz no this is the

00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:23,400
Wizard of Oz I'm setting the stage here

00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:26,100
right so these are kind of like in the

00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,590
early days before like two years ago

00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:33,060
there were five rendering engines that

00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:35,850
were really important we're gonna we're

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,260
going to look and see if I can get my

00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:40,110
operator friend up there to click on

00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:42,870
that fun button we're going to see how

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:48,590
these five browser render engines behave

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:51,590
at this point and I can I get a click

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,590
slide

00:07:52,310 --> 00:08:04,800
they're thinking about there we go okay

00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:07,949
so you can start to see Firefox is a

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,289
thing it's growing Safari starts to

00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:15,689
become a thing operas of thing chrome

00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:18,710
happens 2009 it really takes off right

00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:23,520
like 2011 was a huge year for Chrome and

00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:27,479
I was curious what happened here

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:31,760
I think I need focus on the webpage not

00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:37,169
on the HTML button if that's possible

00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:42,029
computer here there we go so 2011 big

00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:44,970
year just anyone remember watching the

00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:51,180
season finale of Saturday Night Live in

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:54,500
2011 there was a Google Chrome Lady Gaga

00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:57,510
commercial which was she was also the

00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,610
musical performer so that was really

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,649
interesting but also that same here

00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:05,519
there was a really influential Justin

00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:07,440
Bieber Google Chrome commercial and so

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,610
I'm convinced Lady Gaga and Justin

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:19,350
Bieber are like responsible for chrome

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:22,440
success which is important later on okay

00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:24,240
so not a bad way like some bad stuff

00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,740
happens after this point in history

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,740
and it gets a little dark

00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:39,920
less sorry to make you do this one last

00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:43,290
time we click play again and we're done

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:48,779
so chrome is really taking off really

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:51,990
really grown everyone else's expense and

00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:54,480
then we so effectively that's where we

00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:56,450
are up until pretty recently

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,529
ok so now I'm going to try to click I

00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:06,270
can get focused on the slide and gonna

00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:08,910
mistake this works yes okay so so this

00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:13,410
guy Bruce Lawson he had the privilege

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:14,760
I'll pose all waiting for a photo he was

00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:19,920
the guy who got to write the following

00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:21,450
article right 300 million users to move

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,910
to WebKit so what happens I used to work

00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:26,370
at other intervals manager we for site

00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:28,680
compatibility reasons we we found it was

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:32,610
not sustainable to keep maintaining

00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,839
presto too many websites did not test in

00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,790
Opera

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:40,200
raise your hand if you've ever tested in

00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:43,320
walbro pretty unique set of individuals

00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,950
here where I live in the United States

00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:50,339
most people said opera was that

00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:52,410
and it was big in different locales and

00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:54,150
different markets but eventually site

00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,339
compatibility became too much of a

00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:58,890
burden we couldn't justify it and so we

00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:00,300
we made the switch to WebKit and I think

00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,700
it was like a week or two later that

00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,410
that Google decided to fork from WebKit

00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,510
so then we didn't go back and update a

00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,640
lot of clothes but we switched to like I

00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,790
don't think we actually ever did

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,170
anything with wicked

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,410
so just to read that Pro consumers will

00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,910
initially known as a better site

00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,860
ability especially with mobile facing

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,259
sites many of which have been only been

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,329
tested in WebKit browsers a couple years

00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:24,790
later like a very similar article was

00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:28,379
written by some Microsoft guy but I

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,379
don't know that he's got cool hair

00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:37,329
Microsoft people like that Joe so mr. VP

00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:40,420
Joe he writing for the same reason like

00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:42,129
we can't keep up edge HTML like it's too

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,529
pasta it's too expensive we're not we're

00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:47,350
not like he says we're not suddenly

00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:48,670
intend to adopt chromium to create

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,500
better web compatibility for our

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,769
customers unless fragmentation of the

00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:56,800
web for all developers which again

00:11:53,769 --> 00:12:00,639
that's the best two engines were toast

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:05,410
at this point right interestingly to

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,970
close source browsers were unable to

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:14,170
keep up I don't know if that's like a

00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:17,860
lesson but it's just a fact and a letter

00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:23,470
in rebates and contemplate it's a good

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:25,240
joke it turns out we're using so we're

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,910
already starting to see some of the

00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,860
effects of that right like of other

00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:31,300
people moving to chromium or planes and

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,670
it's like oh we really don't have to

00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:37,180
test another browsers now which is which

00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:40,839
is weird so here's here's the modern see

00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:43,209
him right where we've got three of the

00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:45,100
main rendering engines left WebKit blink

00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:46,870
are different in the finality but I

00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,329
would consider them separate right

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:52,550
they're related but they implement

00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:56,450
different api's different supporters

00:12:52,550 --> 00:13:02,360
things and there's lots of little

00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:03,980
chromium friends based browsers so often

00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,300
the question you get when you start

00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,230
thinking about this is like what don't

00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,910
we all just use blink or why don't we

00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,770
all just use decorative right like

00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:18,050
monoculture is only bad if it's not my

00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:20,900
culture is my conclusion that's not true

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:23,180
so realistically they're like raise your

00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,740
hand if it's ever like been a pain in

00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,630
the butt for you to fix a bug in a

00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,910
different browser where you're just like

00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:31,910
all my stuff working and then I opened

00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:33,740
it in whatever browser and you're like

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,600
crap I have to rewrite this or have to

00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,640
implement some hacks like it really

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,790
slows you down and it feels frustrating

00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,890
right like like raise your hand if

00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,420
you've ever thought as you're like going

00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,160
through this pain you're like you know

00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:49,400
what this is good for me this is good

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:52,010
for the long-term lab these are the

00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:56,330
special people and I want to hire all

00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:58,940
three of you like what I'm going to

00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:01,850
hopefully argue in the next three

00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:04,370
minutes or however long I have is this

00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:06,160
is a good thing and so we're gonna we're

00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:08,780
going to talk about a couple of examples

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,800
so so this one is interesting I don't

00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:16,370
know if you read mailing lists or follow

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,750
working groups but if you do you might

00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:22,600
know a little bit about in physics guys

00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:25,520
this was a wiki or ycg or no surprise

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:29,960
proposal by some chrome engineers to add

00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:33,350
an attribute to HTML to allow you to get

00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:35,960
image orientation or like not

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,550
orientation of an aspect ratio right you

00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,320
know like as things become responsive

00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:41,180
and if you have an image and it's like

00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,000
width 100% and you change the viewport

00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:46,460
like things to get wonky and so they

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,650
said we're gonna add this attribute and

00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,980
the way this would work just look at the

00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,960
top line

00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:56,940
have this even say like this is the

00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:59,420
intrinsic size so this had an

00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,650
implementation it was a experimental

00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,540
chromium platform teacher you could have

00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:07,760
been enabled it your your browser and

00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:09,360
tested and given feedback it turns out

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,040
ha shucks

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,890
I didn't take a screenshot of this but

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,900
gin Simmons and some other folks they

00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:17,640
they said you know I don't think we need

00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,740
to add a new attribute to HTML we can

00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,520
just do this like with tools that are

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:25,170
exist in this these three lines of code

00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,330
three through five like if we just

00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:31,850
invent this aspect ratio property and

00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:34,530
stick it and user agent style sheets CSS

00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:36,660
that the web page uses to render

00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:39,350
everything by default we can get this

00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,640
for free and so this was a pretty cool

00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:44,040
proposal like kind of proposal was

00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,360
implemented in gecko and we've been

00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,640
experimenting with it just recently

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,170
blink so not an intent to implement and

00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,760
so they're like yeah this is actually a

00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:53,940
better idea

00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,740
and so this is an instance where when

00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,380
you have competition where you have

00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:01,440
people who are competing in a friendly

00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:04,170
manner to get like to a good place you

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,390
you can kind of push in a poll and you

00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:08,370
can say this we have this idea and say

00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:10,650
well what about this and ultimately the

00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:12,300
web is a better place like it's probably

00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:14,880
slowed us down I don't know six months

00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:18,540
or something about how the days right

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:21,660
and you still can't use this today or

00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:23,310
rather you don't need to use this today

00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,350
but when it's when it's implemented and

00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,209
all the evergreen browsers will still be

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,069
a little bit of time

00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:30,410
it'll be a better API it's like one less

00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:33,980
attribute you have to know about and you

00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:38,540
never have to touch America another

00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:40,189
another area which is interesting is so

00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,910
this is not really like in the item API

00:16:40,189 --> 00:16:46,579
space but it is privacy right now if

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:49,670
you've been following this there it

00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:51,949
talks about this tomorrow my Selina and

00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:54,649
others probably like privacy it's kind

00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:57,019
of like this really hot area for web

00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:59,019
browsers right now so we've been in

00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:00,980
Firefox been doing lots of stuff with

00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:03,079
what we call enhanced tracking

00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,240
protection we just we just announced

00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:11,959
recently that we're going to blog for

00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:14,569
tracking cookies and crypto crypto by

00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:17,740
default and you can you can track finger

00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:17,740
printers if you will enable that

00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:22,250
chromium has some interesting kind of

00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:24,829
proposals and counterproposals for this

00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:31,100
vessel a collection of API skull

00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:32,690
privacy's index sandbox it's API is kind

00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,270
of just like general privacy framework

00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:38,659
way to think about these things that's

00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:40,039
slightly different Safari also announced

00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:42,049
they're intelligent tracking information

00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:44,690
they've been blogging about this which

00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:46,370
is inspired by the Firefox stuff and

00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:51,520
they put a slightly different spin on it

00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:53,929
but you can see how as as an end user

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,830
like we benefit from this type of

00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:59,390
competition and we also have more choice

00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,100
privacy is this area where it's kind of

00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:03,590
about the there's there is a Venn

00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,330
diagram of like web standards but then

00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:08,510
there's also just like product specific

00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:10,820
stuff so we may ultimately all end up

00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:13,460
you know designing the API is that honor

00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:17,750
the principles for to privacy and

00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:20,020
security but we may you know you may be

00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:24,550
able to just pick and choose browsers to

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:29,740
in different attitudes here's here's

00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:34,300
another area where I believe diversities

00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:35,860
is interested in useful so this is an

00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:39,720
icon which represents the thing called

00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:43,090
echo through Gekko a few I think I

00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:46,330
mentioned earlier today I addressed

00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:48,670
Bowman's what so if if you've ever

00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:51,130
developed something using webview has

00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:53,320
anyone used webview here a couple of

00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,820
people you might be like billing android

00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,640
apps or building your own browsers or

00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,650
whatever the crappy thing about web

00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,500
views is tied to the version of Android

00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:05,130
that your users are home and so there

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:10,090
are multiple versions of Android like a

00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:12,280
million or so and you can't you can't

00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,840
reliably depend on certain you guys they

00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,100
just don't exist in my view and so what

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,840
we've done have one of the core

00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:20,350
principles of effective view is you have

00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:22,450
like a stable rendering engine that has

00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:24,640
support for all the web standards that a

00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:27,670
Firefox of Orvis there's not webview

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,890
chrome parity understand and it's

00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:32,050
portable its predictable and you can go

00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,870
and like build things with it and so

00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:36,880
this is kind of like innovation in the

00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:39,040
web embedding space and and maybe that

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,070
will inspire chrome to come back and say

00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:46,270
like we've got our googles right

00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:48,220
and like benefits users you can you can

00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:50,920
go ahead and use gecko build get review

00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,240
to build a browser today we have one

00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,760
called Firefox preview we've got a

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,490
Firefox reality there's another browser

00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:01,330
called Puma they're using a Geico gecko

00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:03,790
view codebase hooked up with the coil

00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:10,420
with a payment stuff a hundred million

00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:11,890
dollars that DS is around today so those

00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,770
are those are three examples - you kind

00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:18,610
of have like a Pia's platforming stuff

00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:20,260
policy feature ease stuff just some

00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:22,240
examples of why diversity is important I

00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:25,540
think and I think it's also useful for

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,100
us to consider like what like if we if

00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:30,700
we just get super cynical and look at

00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:33,070
who is creating like who's building the

00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,950
browser engines like what is driving

00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:40,030
their vision for the web I don't want to

00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:44,070
get like super dark or crashing and so

00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:44,070
like we're gonna be positive about this

00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,500
so this is this is like shadow Deverell

00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,870
moment right the Mike Taylor view on the

00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,540
world like what does that the dude like

00:20:52,870 --> 00:21:00,670
what what drives them they sell hardware

00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:01,960
they have some services and like that's

00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:04,390
where most of their money comes from

00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,720
right and so they're what motivates them

00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:11,020
like is is an interesting question if if

00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,610
you were at tea packed in Japan or just

00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,500
like you like to read IRC logs or

00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:16,720
whatever like Apple had a couple of

00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,299
interesting CSS proposals in the season

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,850
working group related to like the new

00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:24,039
iPad desktop mode right the trance all

00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:25,929
really like interesting challenges for

00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:28,500
getting the desktop browser and kind of

00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:31,210
like a mobile - form factor like with

00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:34,030
text inflation inflation and whatever in

00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:35,890
text I suggest I forget the details so

00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:38,830
they're trying to solve certain problems

00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:40,419
that that like Google is not

00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,090
transferable right Google doesn't sell

00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:45,820
my pads but Google so at its core

00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:47,559
Google's an advertising company which i

00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:50,590
think is interesting consider like they

00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:54,250
have some hardware stuff but they also

00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:56,620
have tons of services right like all all

00:21:54,250 --> 00:22:00,039
the really cool apps web apps that I use

00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:05,760
every day are run by Google right like

00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:09,419
Google Docs Google Wave pays a lot

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,419
orchid blogger

00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:19,460
yeah like it's tough

00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,460
yes we will read your familia box right

00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:28,110
sorry

00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:29,640
so but like really interesting like high

00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,980
performance whether that's like like the

00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,440
Gmail codebase they're just like Gmail

00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:37,020
web app is amazing Google Docs amazingly

00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,330
really really pushes like their needs

00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,400
and and this is my opinion of course

00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:45,810
come with Mozilla what do we do at

00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:47,100
Mozilla like like did like the cynical

00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:49,440
view is like we're a bunch of like ivory

00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:53,610
tower nerds just like trying to make the

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,900
internet the best place possible that's

00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:57,270
maybe not a negative thing I don't know

00:22:54,900 --> 00:23:02,280
someone else didn't have better negative

00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:03,570
answer we will respond right so like

00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,030
we're not we're not trying to sell as

00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:09,440
we're not trying to so I think we try to

00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:12,210
sell hardware once a dude remember God

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,360
and then Google and pop company and say

00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:20,000
actually

00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:21,289
so like we're all motivated motivated by

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,279
different things and I think that's

00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:27,110
actually like really positive like just

00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:28,549
because Mozilla has a proposal for a

00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,779
thing is because that was a proposal

00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:32,809
thing it's not mean it's going to be

00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:34,880
baked into a platform at least it hasn't

00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:37,490
historically like there's been this kind

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,860
of a common understanding of like at the

00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:42,710
w3c level before something becomes like

00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:44,960
a standard you need at least two

00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:48,470
independent implementations of standard

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,480
right and so and hopefully more than

00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,010
just to like this is the model a

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,850
continues like we really need to rely on

00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:57,230
each other and you kind of like need to

00:23:54,850 --> 00:24:00,200
collaborate and develop things in a way

00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:02,210
that's sane for implementations right

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,000
like is it even possible to build this

00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:06,289
thing in blink or web catering gecko we

00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,380
need to think about things that are good

00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:11,120
for our users all of us are concerned

00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:16,039
about privacy and security these days

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:18,200
like these are like I get emotional

00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:20,470
these are like scary weird times to be

00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,470
alive

00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,740
you know like like there are people who

00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,090
depending on which kind of fees that are

00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,820
in in which websites they're visiting

00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:36,640
you might go to jail right like that's

00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:40,300
why it might be worse than jail and so

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,250
like we have to keep people safe so we

00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,990
can't just do everything that one person

00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,510
wants to do because it fits their

00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:48,940
interests the other point to this slide

00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:50,980
is really like with the intrinsic size

00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,510
thing it was like it worked and it's a

00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:55,390
cool proposal but that was person alone

00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:57,280
like if you've ever written anything or

00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:00,280
any code or any paper like you know that

00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,890
version was always like it works like it

00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:05,010
can always be better and so this kind of

00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:08,920
like diverse browser engine world

00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:10,750
enables that and like we steal things

00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:16,110
from each other all the time and I think

00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:19,170
that's really positive let's see so I

00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:21,760
told you you would all be convinced and

00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:28,750
you really like connecting with this lab

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:29,920
right now so so what can you do if like

00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:33,850
I don't thought the future looks like

00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:37,120
right like Google is large and they have

00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:39,670
a lot of market share they also like do

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,200
really interesting things I've never met

00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:45,280
anyone who works on a Google Chrome team

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:48,010
that's a monster that's reassuring to me

00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,840
but I think I think we also need more

00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:51,640
than that right like we need we don't

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,410
just need Google to not be monsters like

00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,720
we need other browsers to be able to

00:25:53,410 --> 00:26:00,910
grow and flourish and like have a chance

00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:02,920
at working so some of them some concrete

00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,450
steps you can do as an individual as a

00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:07,830
developer

00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:10,370
has anyone ever seen this page yeah

00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:13,140
probably have right like this is I think

00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:14,370
document duck compat mode browser table

00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:19,530
which lets you know if you're in person

00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:22,110
or not so these are the Indian bathroom

00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:24,300
and hot tables that let you know like is

00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:25,920
this API so well supported like as

00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,870
you're as you're shipping production

00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,090
written code like it's probably good to

00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:33,420
check this stuff out like what will

00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:36,780
happen if you know any % of my users can

00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:39,420
use this feature to consider like and we

00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:41,370
should still open up our apps our

00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:46,380
websites and other browser is intestine

00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:50,540
and people still do this sometimes yeah

00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,540
that's good where that please

00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:03,270
here we go has anyone here ever like

00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:03,270
reported a browser bug

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,770
okay that's really cool that's like

00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:11,050
maybe 10 people 15 people has anyone

00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:12,520
here ever was ever like afraid they

00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:14,650
thought they found the browser bug but

00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,610
you were like it's probably my fault I'm

00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:18,190
not that smart

00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:21,880
it's like at least as many people maybe

00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:27,430
more does anyone get work for a browser

00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:29,050
company like three times as many there's

00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,650
a lot of hand-wringing sorry like raise

00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,180
your hand

00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:34,120
they've has a browser engineer someone

00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:52,840
filed a bug and they were wrong and you

00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:55,000
felt angry right like you can file them

00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,640
too but still at a web kid to see our

00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,350
bug or you can just go to web chromatic

00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,420
common file bug and if it it's like a

00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:09,370
real Iran issue like my team they just

00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:11,410
like do that for you so yeah so my final

00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:13,240
plea I was I didn't have the time to do

00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:15,250
the Photoshop work but I was like the

00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,350
other strategy like if that does not

00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:20,410
work if we raise enough money to get

00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:22,750
Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber to do a

00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:27,550
Firefox commercial

00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:27,550
like 2020 we could really turn this

00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:33,770
weres dees he's got all the money we

00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:42,470
could get him for hundred million

00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:45,470
dollars I'm confident okay so so that's

00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:48,040
my talk I have a web blog you can join

00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:51,190
my web rain just an employee classes

00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,190
very much

00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,180
