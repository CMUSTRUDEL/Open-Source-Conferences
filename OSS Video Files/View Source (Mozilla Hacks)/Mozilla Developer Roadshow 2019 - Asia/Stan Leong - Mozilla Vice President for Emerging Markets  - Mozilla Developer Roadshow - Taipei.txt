00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,600
I am back!

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,900
So, I mentioned how we at Mozilla

00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,500
believe that this region is where the future of 

00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,700
global innovation, digital innovation is going to happen over the next few years,

00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,250
and I want to walk through that a little bit

00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,230
on why I believe that’s the business case,

00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,230
and how Mozilla can help you.

00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,900
So, my job is to help Mozilla grow in this region,

00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,800
and we call it Emerging Markets,

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,320
it covers Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa, Latin America.

00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,420
But I want to talk today a little bit about Asia and Southeast Asia.

00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,870
So, taking a step back,

00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:50,050
Mozilla is a company that makes a variety of products and tools,

00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,050
it's not just a browser,

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,950
and we wanted to make sure that you are aware

00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,250
that there are so many tools for developers,

00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,450
for companies, startups, partners,

00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,310
that we can help you in your mission.

00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,450
We've got a series of products that are out today,

00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,850
whether it's part of a browser,

00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,800
or a mobile app that you can use.

00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,600
So, everything from Lockwise, Monitor, Send,

00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,600
of course Firefox Browser.

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,400
We have multiple browsers that you can use both for desktop, iOS, Android.

00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,540
And we have a new version called Firefox Lite.

00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,900
And I want to spend a little bit of time on this

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,000
because this is the product of our Taipei office.

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,970
So, we've an office as I mentioned in Taipei,

00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,890
and our team recently just launched this product.

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,770
It is focused for Emerging Market Countries.

00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,230
And when I say Emerging Market Countries,

00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,150
we want to focus on localizing the product to be successful.

00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,350
So, we are venturing into turning the browser

00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,250
into something more than a browser.

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,070
So, we want to create new experiences around news,

00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,570
playing games, shopping,

00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,700
and in the future, other areas like travel.

00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,410
And so, this just became available this week,

00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,600
you can find it in your Google Play Store

00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,400
and hopefully you guys will enjoy this

00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,880
and give us feedback on where you think you would like us to take this.

00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,140
So, looking at the region of Southeast Asia,

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,140
and we're here in Taiwan,

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,440
we want to make sure that

00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,070
in terms of the business context of Asia, Southeast Asia,

00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,150
and I am not even considering India and China.

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,250
So, when we talk about Southeast Asia,

00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,830
as a region it's the fifth largest economy in the world.

00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:44,830
Alright?

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,790
And more than 50% of the users are under 30 years old.

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,200
And there're 700 million mobile devices in this region.

00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,930
So, mobile users, I think there is more mobile devices than people.

00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,560
So, it's a very digital first region

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,980
and therefore there's going to be a huge digital economy that's growing.

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,240
Every day there is almost four million new internet users

00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,240
coming online in Southeast Asia.

00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,540
And remember, this is not including China and India.

00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,140
Okay?

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,120
It's projected that over the next five to six years

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,830
there'll be a digital economy worth US$ 200 billion

00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,530
when you count it all up.

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,260
And it's growing at approximately...

00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,220
it's doubling every two years.

00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,000
So, when we get to 2025,

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,300
it's a US$ 200 billion digital economy in this region alone, right?

00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,300
And, when you look at the trends,

00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,650
it's around travel,

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,200
it’s around digital entertainment,

00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,300
it's around e-commerce,

00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,750
it's around fintechs.

00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,550
So, I think you guys are all aware of that

00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,700
as developers working for companies or startups,

00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,850
but this is where it is at,

00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,250
and that’s why we believe that

00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,350
the future global innovation is coming in this region

00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,000
and it's going to happen in this region.

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,380
So, at Mozilla we are committed to helping build this web platform

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,000
and there are a number of products and tools

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,100
that we want to make sure you are aware of,

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,720
so that you can make it part of your mission.

00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,020
You can make it part of your toolset and your skillset, right?

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,360
And at Mozilla, we believe that privacy is not an option,

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,860
it has to be built into the product.

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,460
How you handle data?

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,950
How you ensure privacy of your user information?

00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,950
This is all part of everything we do.

00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,200
We mentioned there is a lot of resources for developers,

00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,900
Right?

00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:01,630
and it's not just developer tools such as CSS Grid, MDN Web Docs,

00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,550
and a blog called MDN Hacks.

00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,750
By the way, the Web Docs and Hacks

00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:12,300
have over 14 million developers hitting our sites every single month.

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,300
So, there is a global reach

00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,900
where Mozilla is creating tools and information,

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,190
and webinars, and blogs, and tutorials

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,690
on enabling an open internet

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,240
and the future of developers and innovation that's happening.

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,700
And we would love more and more developers

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,460
to really take advantage of this open free resource.

00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,800
But there are also technologies where we're investing in,

00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,500
like forward thinking technologies like WebAssembly,

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
we believe that's the future of the web

00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:54,930
where you can write code that doesn't need a JavaScript interpreter or compiler.

00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,100
And you can write code in any language,

00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,940
and it will run in a web browser.

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,340
And all the major web browsers already support WebAssembly.

00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,800
So, this is really the future,

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,100
we're investing heavily into this.

00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,650
And we would love people to start thinking about

00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,450
what does the future of the web look like,

00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,660
how can we run apps inside a browser in the future.

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,260
There is other technologies like Common Voice,

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,260
where we believe that

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:26,590
the voice data shouldn't be held by a couple of large companies

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,430
and we're helping create a global data set

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,260
in many many languages around the world,

00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,260
so that device manufacturers,

00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,560
people who make apps

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,360
can leverage voice training models that is open and free to use.

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,800
So, we want to make sure that things like voice is something that is open.

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,000
And Firefox Reality,

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,120
it’s the first web VR or the first virtual reality browser.

00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,830
And so, we're doing a lot of things around web VR,

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,000
creating virtual reality experiences using a browser,

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,050
and today we'll have Phil come on stage and talk about more that in detail.

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,720
We will have Gene talk about CSS Grid with you guys,

00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,200
and Web of Things,

00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,400
the final topic that I want to talk about is IoT.

00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,600
So, we also believe that IoT should be interoperable.

00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,150
We want to create an open standard for IoT,

00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,150
and so we’ve created a framework

00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,200
and we've a demo and a discussion today

00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,200
about how you can use technologies that are open, available, free to use.

00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,200
And we'd love your input and help

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,880
to make this a better product and framework for the future.

00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,100
So, WebAssembly,

00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,000
we just had an announcement yesterday

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,390
about a partnership between Mozilla, Intel, RedHat

00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,100
talking about WebAssembly.

00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,700
We believe that this is the early pioneers

00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,190
in terms of companies coming together to think about

00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,150
how the future of the web can be.

00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:10,050
And a really huge announcement that just came out

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,480
and we'd love for you to just read more about it

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,700
and join us in this open source movement.

00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,700
I mentioned Common Voice,

00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,900
we welcome and invite anybody

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:30,250
who would be willing to donate your voice to a global dataset

00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,430
that can be shared in local languages around the world.

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,630
So, whatever your language that you can help,

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:42,550
we'd really appreciate anyone to come donate your voice,

00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,350
be part of this,

00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,550
utilize the models that are created.

00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,800
And again, you give in and you take as well.

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,820
This I think is a great movement in democratizing voice data.

00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,920
So, I mentioned to you all the technologies.

00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,500
I mentioned we have an office here in Taipei,

00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,100
but we also support the rest of this region,

00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,700
so we have hackathons,

00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,700
we have webinars,

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
we have community members all over Asia and Southeast Asia

00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:20,500
conducting regular meetups, hackathons, webinars

00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,810
and we are really helping developers get access to create new products.

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,810
And we are also open to talking to startups.

00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:34,490
We'd love to meet startups that are aligned to Mozilla,

00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:39,280
that are using Mozilla technologies or open source technologies.

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,410
And we think we'd love to talk to you about how we can help.

00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:43,510
Alright!

00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,810
So, with that I want to appreciate your time,

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,200
and will hand over to the next presenter.

00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,600
