Hello, everyone and welcome to Mozilla's first developer roadshow here in Korea. 

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,160
We're super excited to be here.

00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:20,000
A couple of housekeeping things before we get started - 

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,840
if you're looking for Wi Fi, 

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,720
this is the network and the password.

00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,740
There are blue signs around the building, 

00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,920
here around the room, 

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,840
they also have it if you don't get it right now, 

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,840
but I know that's always important for folks.

00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,740
If you're looking for the toilets,

00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,380
you go out the main door across the hall, 

00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,380
and you'll see signs, 

00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,800
they're back where the elevators are. 

00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,220
So you can follow the signs, for those - 

00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,220
Feel free to do that at any point. 

00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:53,480
We also have drinks and sandwiches up just past where you registered and signed in 

00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,160
and feel free to help yourself. 

00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,080
And afterwards we'll have a little bit of social time 

00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,200
as well as some demos in the back. 

00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,400
So please feel free to hang around, 

00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,800
talk to any of the speakers, 

00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,320
talk amongst yourselves. 

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,960
And again, we're really, really happy to have you here. 

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,440
As you all I assume, know Mozilla, 

00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,600
and I assume you all know Firefox as well. 

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,840
One thing a lot of people are not always familiar with about Mozilla

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,580
is the fact that we're a nonprofit corporation, 

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,680
which means that when we say 

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,720
"Our mission is to put people before profit and make the internet open, accessible for everyone", 

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,020
that is actually why we are incorporated. 

00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,880
We don't have shareholders, 

00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,980
we are not beholden to any stock market or investors. 

00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,040
We literally exist for the purpose of making the internet better for all of you, 

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,740
and for all the people who use our various products, especially including Firefox. 

00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,080
So hello, I'm Ali Spivak. 

00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,280
I'm the director of developer relations at Mozilla.

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,500
I'm based in San Francisco. 

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,600
This is my first time in Seoul so I'm super excited to be here. 

00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,020
I have not stopped eating since we got off the plane yesterday. 

00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,700
So I'm kind of happy about that as well. 

00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,880
You can reach me on Twitter @alispivak

00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,880
Feel free if you have questions. 

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,680
That's usually a great place to reach me 

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,680
and I'll be here this evening as well.

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,580
I assume all of you are familiar with Firefox. 

00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,260
Yeah.

00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,060
Are you familiar with the various different versions of Firefox? 

00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,720
Okay, so we have a couple different ways for developers to use Firefox. 

00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,480
Our first is Nightly. 

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,960
So Nightly is exactly what it sounds - 

00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,080
it is updated pretty much daily, nightly. 

00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,380
It is the version for the least risk adverse amongst you. 

00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,560
Which means as we are building things in Firefox, 

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,920
the code is updated with all of those changes. 

00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,000
So if you want far out previews of what's coming in releases, 

00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:14,620
Nightly is a great place to look and see what features are coming. It's also the least stable. 

00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,780
We also have Developer Edition, which is also called beta. 

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,160
The Developer Edition is very specifically designed with access to all of our developer tools. 

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,760
That is a six week out preview of what is coming in the next release. 

00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,500
So, for example, we currently have Firefox 70. 

00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,600
So Developer Edition is 71, which will be released six weeks later.

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:46,060
Starting in January, Firefox is actually moving to a six week - four week instead of six week release cycle. 

00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,380
So that process will speed up so your preview will only be about four weeks out as opposed to six. 

00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,020
We have a whole bunch of new features that I just wanted to touch on -

00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,840
a few that are kind of exciting. 

00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,720
One of these is HTML forms and secure passwords. 

00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,580
Is anybody here familiar with Firefox Lockwise? 

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,480
Yay, one person, couple people. 

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,580
So Lockwise is a new product that is integrated - 

00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,320
it's standalone and also integrated into Firefox - 

00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,080
that basically functions as a password manager.

00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,800
It's integrated in - it's synced with your Firefox accounts.

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,700
One of the things we've added is the ability to update the input element HTML

00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,020
so you can generate secure passwords. 

00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,460
If you have Lockwise, users - if they have Lockwise, 

00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,780
users can store them but you can do this in any password manager. 

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,960
So this simplifies the ability when you're creating forms to help your users create better passwords. 

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,960
And it's easier for you as a developer as well. 

00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,020
We also have new CSS options for styling underlines. 

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,160
So you can set the thickness, the offset and the skip ink.

00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,860
And the skip ink basically determines whether or not you skip the bottom on glyphs. 

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,920
It's probably hard to see but there are some examples of how this shows up in the browser. 

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:18,140
But it gives you a lot more options for styling the underlines on your text just using CSS. 

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,960
We also have scroll snapping so this allows you to jump to elements. 

00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:32,540
Basically, it allows your web pages to act much more like people are familiar with in mobile apps or native. 

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,220
So it's much smoother experiences when you're looking at web pages. 

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,280
We've also enabled dark mode. 

00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:46,400
So basically this allows you to keep people's preference whether they want a light or dark mode, 

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,280
so that you're not having a jarring experience if you're browsing. 

00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,840
We've also made a lot of improvements to our developer tools in Firefox. 

00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,400
I'm not going to go into all of these. 

00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:06,380
We have a wealth of tooling, particularly around CSS that some of the other speakers are going to get into. 

00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:13,100
But I will note that both the JavaScript debugger and web console have had a lot of performance improvements. 

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,260
And so if you're using any of those or have used them 

00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,600
or never used them, 

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,900
you might want to check them out, 

00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,080
the performance on them will be great. 

00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,940
We've also just added pause on DOM mutation. 

00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,160
So this is around breakpoints, so you can pause scripts, 

00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,080
particularly if you're doing rather complex dynamic sites, 

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,000
sometimes it can be really hard to see where you're having an issue. 

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,480
So this actually allows you to pause 

00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,040
and look at where they're impacting specific elements. 

00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,420
It's much easier to do your debugging with this feature. 

00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,800
And we've also made improvements to accessibility. 

00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,980
We have an accessibility panel in Firefox. 

00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,380
This allows you to simulate color blindness for example, 

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,240
and also see where there's contrast errors. 

00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:06,920
So really gives you a lot more tools to help people who may be visually impaired access your websites.

00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,120
We've also added some user features that are really awesome.

00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,260
We've been very focused on new privacy and security features. 

00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,820
So we have something called enhanced tracking protection. 

00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:25,720
And basically what this does is it blocks known trackers and problematic sites. 

00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,680
This is now default in Firefox. 

00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,540
We've added a few special tools. 

00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,140
One is social tracking protection. 

00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:39,780
So it very specifically blocks sites like Facebook and others from cross tracking you from sites.

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,800
We also have a Privacy Protection report, and what this basically does is 

00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,780
it shows you all of the trackers that have been blocked over a specific time period. 

00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,540
It's pretty terrifying. 

00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:59,840
I recommend people take a look at it to see how insidious a lot of the tracking is. 

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,540
It's thousands and thousands of them over just a normal browsing session. 

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,540
And also, if you do use Facebook, we have an extension called Facebook containers. 

00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,300
And this essentially creates a container for you to run Facebook in that isolates it from the rest of your web browsing. 

00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:20,000
So helping keep that tracking from affecting all the other things that you're doing. 

00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,840
And then my own personal favorite. 

00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,840
I always have a lot of tabs open. 

00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:33,420
This is autoplay blocking, so it blocks audio - audio in video. 

00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,820
So if something happens and something reloads, 

00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,440
you don't have to like me go to frantically clicking through hundreds of tabs 

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,460
trying to find that one video that's playing the advertisement that you don't really want. 

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,120
And that is just a super short preview of some of the new things we've added in Firefox. 

00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:00,500
And like I said, some of our other speakers will be digging deep into some of our CSS tooling which is really fantastic. 

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,820
But for now, I think we will move on to our next speaker. 

00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,860
So Kathy Giori is going to be talking about WebThings, 

00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,700
which is Mozilla's new set of tooling for the Internet of Things.

00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,640
