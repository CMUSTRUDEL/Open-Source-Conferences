We are super excited to help host

00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,200
the Mozilla Developer Roadshow here in Taipei.

00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,500
It is the first time this event is here in Taipei

00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,850
and it's also the place of our Asia headquarters

00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,850
in our office in Xinyi in Taipei.

00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,100
So, we are happy to participate,

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,430
it's coinciding with the Meet-up Taipei Startup conference

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,190
which should have over 70,000 participants over a three-day period

00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,410
and it's our chance to tell the developer world

00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,000
and this part of the world

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,030
how Mozilla is contributing to the open internet,

00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,500
keeping the internet a global public resource

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,500
and all the tools that we have to offer

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,800
that many developers may actually not be aware of

00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,900
and so, we would love to share that with all the developers in the region.

00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,050
The Southeast Asia region

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,880
is one of the fastest growing economies in the world.

00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,560
I believe over four million internet users are coming online each day.

00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,000
That's Asia and Southeast Asia

00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,900
and it's a booming digital economy

00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:15,200
thatâ€™s projected to double every two years for the next 10 years

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,300
and it's something that we believe

00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,700
that all developers have to pay attention to

00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,600
in terms of the products they are making.

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,400
There's a lot of digital trends out in the region

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,100
that we'd love to share from our office,

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,800
in terms of research we're doing on the market,

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,800
the users, the countries

00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,470
and we hope that all companies whether they're startups or large companies

00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,600
are able to create great products for the region.

00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,500
We are super excited to help host the Mozilla Developer Roadshow.

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,700
It is a rolling series of events that Mozilla brings out to the world,

00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,000
in all parts of the world.

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,680
And in this case, we are in Taipei this week

00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,880
and it's coinciding with

00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,500
the Meet Taipei Startup conference in Taipei this week

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,160
and that conference will have over 70,000 participants,

00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,100
and Developer Roadshow will bring out the best in our technologies

00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,340
that Mozilla has to offer for developers in the region.

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,600
We believe that it is a very important region of growth,

00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,000
Southeast Asia and Asia.

00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,650
The amount of technologies that Mozilla has to offer

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,500
is something that when we speak to developers,

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,000
a lot of them are unaware

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,810
of all the different tools and technologies that Mozilla is working on

00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,810
and they are pleasantly surprised.

00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,300
And so, when we engage with developers in this region,

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,900
and especially in Taipei,

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,400
we want to work with startups,

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,250
we want to work with partnering companies

00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,350
and we want to share our technologies

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,350
such as MDN Docs 

00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,540
and a blog called MDN Hacks,

00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,540
CSS Grid,

00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,880
tools that will help bring CSS Style Sheets to the next level.

00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,000
We also have a slew of amazing technologies

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,500
that we are working on from the R&D front.

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,500
Common Voice, Web of Things,

00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,100
WebAssembly,

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,650
Rust, a programming language

00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,730
that enables high performance system programming

00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,400
and mixed reality

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,780
allowing developers to create VR applications inside the browser.

00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,000
So, a lot of these technologies we believe

00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,900
can help future companies, startups, developers and partners

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,600
create the future technologies and products for themselves

00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,750
and to make the internet a global public resource

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,250
and so we want to share that.

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,690
And this is our way of doing that through these roadshows,

00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,590
through these talks, hackathons.

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,290
We have an active community here in Taipei and Taiwan as well.

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,100
And so, we host many hackathons, university events, meetups.

00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,100
And so, this is part of the culture in Mozilla to share.

00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,350
It's exciting to have this first event in Taipei

00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,800
for the Developer Roadshow.

00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,200
The amount of participants at the Meet Taipei startup event

00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,700
will be over 70,000 people

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,460
and the amount of startups and companies and developers

00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,000
that we will be interacting with

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,830
will be tremendous in our ability to create awareness

00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:23,350
of the tools, technologies and capabilities inside Mozilla

00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,800
that we really want to share and work with

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,200
partnering companies and developers.

00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,450
We think that this will help create more of a community.

00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,310
We really want to grow our Mozilla community

00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,500
and I think this awareness is going to supercharge us for the upcoming year.

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,000
