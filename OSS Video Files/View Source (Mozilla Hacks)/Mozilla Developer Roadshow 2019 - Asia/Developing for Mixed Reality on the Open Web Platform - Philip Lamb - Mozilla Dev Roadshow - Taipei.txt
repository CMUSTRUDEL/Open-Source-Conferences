So, my name is Philip Lamb

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,460
and I'm part of the Mixed Reality Research Group at Mozilla.

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,100
So, by mixed reality we use that as a term to cover

00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,100
both virtual and augmented reality

00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,700
and the full spectrum in between

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,480
because these areas share many of the same tools and techniques and code.

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,530
So mixed reality sits inside Mozilla's Emerging Technologies Division

00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,490
and our mandate in emerging technologies

00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,100
is to identify technologies that have the power

00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,870
to transform the way people interact over the web

00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,480
and to develop those and bring them to market.

00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,580
Before we get to the fun part,

00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,380
now I'd really like to start with this question.

00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,430
As a developer, why should I care about mixed reality?

00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,430
It's a fair question to ask.

00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,900
One obvious answer might be that

00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,860
there is good business in mixed reality.

00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,320
We can flip that around and say,

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,700
why are businesses investing

00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,400
and what are their expectations?

00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,790
So, to answer this question I'm going to rewind a little bit

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,790
and bear with me for a few minutes here.

00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,290
In the last few years,

00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,900
computing has worked its way into

00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,800
almost every area of every business process

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,590
in a real technological revolution,

00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:41,100
but increasingly we faced sometimes overwhelming complexity

00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,500
that that computing has introduced.

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,600
Demands on workers are higher than ever

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,400
and often it's difficult to train or to get workers into the situations

00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,690
though they have the information they need to do that work.

00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:00,280
Particularly computing power has massively increased in 50 years,

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,870
but the interfaces to computing are still often stuck

00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,500
with the same 50-year-old interface model,

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
screens, keyboards.

00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,040
So, we can scale up control systems like this one

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,760
from the Dubai baggage handling system

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,760
to try and manage some of the complexity,

00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,960
but there's very little access

00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,750
that a worker out in the field has to this information.

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,750
So, we have a new problem

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,030
that the control domain is separated from the information domain.

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,800
So, mixed reality proposes a radical reshaping of that interface.

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,910
By going beyond the flat display, the mouse and the keyboard

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,950
we are able to combine the information domain with the control domain.

00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,400
This is not new.

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,100
This revolution is already underway.

00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,100
You'll see applications of this today in agriculture,

00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,300
heavy industry, logistics, medicine, many other areas,

00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,390
but we are still on the upper part of the curve here

00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,020
and over the next decade

00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,800
we'll see the way that millions of workers interact with information change

00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,400
and be adapted by mixed reality.

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,570
Nielsen who produced figures on these kinds of things

00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,570
out of the United States

00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,360
estimate that to the end of this year

00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:29,290
businesses will have spent US$ 10.6 billion on R&D in mixed reality

00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,960
which is up significantly from last year

00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,460
and estimated to rise to US$ 12 billion next year.

00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,800
So, even just consider enterprise spending in this area,

00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,220
there is a huge opportunity for developers and businesses here.

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,800
So, if you believe what I have told you

00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,390
and you think this is an interesting area to work in

00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,360
then how do you get started in this area?

00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,480
So, where do you pick up the tools?

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
What are the skills?

00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,600
Who are your vendors?

00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
And who are going to be your competitors?

00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,100
Well, the good news is

00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,540
for anyone sitting out to develop mixed reality experiences,

00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,830
tools or content,

00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,750
2019 is a great year to be started.

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,670
We have a slew of really awesome new devices in the market this year

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,970
like the HTC Cosmos here,

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,350
bringing super simple setup to PC-VR,

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,560
many new standalone VR devices,

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,850
newer types of controllers and interactions,

00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,850
and huge investments are continuing,

00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,940
$2.9 billion so far into Magic Leap,

00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,070
American Big Four, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft

00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,830
who are making billion dollar bets in this area.

00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,540
And there is just some truly amazing content that’s heaps of fun.

00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,920
You can try out Beat Saber and driving pets nuts

00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,200
or you can spend tens of hours

00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,900
to kind of go immerse in games like Subnautica.

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,700
So, if you're building a business, where do you start?

00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,300
Well, hopefully, if you're smart you start with market segmentation.

00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,300
Where are you going to go for money?

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,690
These are the Nielsen figures for next year,

00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,690
and the predictions for next year,

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,990
segmented here by virtual reality,

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,700
mobile AR, very relevant to you

00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,700
and headset-based AR.

00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,700
Just pretty good figures there.

00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,660
Looking at gaming, mobile AR,

00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,910
$2 billion being spent in that segment.

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:36,910
That's quite crowded.

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,910
There're some other interesting ones there.

00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,400
So, that sounds easy, right?

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,700
Pick a segment you care for.

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,470
But if you're looking say, just take VR for a moment,

00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,000
now you have to pick a platform.

00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,500
VR is ahead of AR market maturity at the moment,

00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,300
but you’ve got a bunch of decisions,

00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,000
devices you are going to target,

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,730
are you going to go for ones that connect to high-end computing?

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,480
Are you going to connect to ones that have standalone?

00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,980
What's your price point?

00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,300
Do you want to have it extremely accessible

00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,800
to people who have only a few dollars

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
or you want people to be spending a thousand dollars?

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,200
Not all devices work with all delivery platforms,

00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,710
so your choice of platform is going to affect where you can sell.

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,550
This comparison here is reasonably comprehensive over here of VR headsets,

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,350
some of their metrics,

00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,950
you can go to this and try out

00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,350
and you can choose for yourself.

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,350
Anyway, it's complex.

00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,450
And it's only the start of the complexity

00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,270
because you have to actually commit to a software platform too.

00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,990
There is a lot of development platforms,

00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,990
a lot of APIs,

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,990
not much of overlap between many of these.

00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,200
And once you have done it,

00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,550
did you make the right choice?

00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,540
Because even since I made this slide,

00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,380
one of these development platforms has been abandoned.

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,480
That's Google Daydream.

00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,420
So, choosing the platform has risks

00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,700
and if you try to mitigate those risks by diversifying across platforms

00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,000
then costs can go up

00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
and the lock-in risks,

00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,800
there is no understatement, they’re quite big.

00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,300
App stores create a few winners

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,700
and a long tail of apps that get very little exposure.

00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,400
Perhaps the app store may reject you if you are a platform

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:40,800
that strays away from certain types of content.

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,200
Or if you encroach on platform monetization features,

00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
so try to build your own social network

00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,500
and run it on Facebook's platform, you'll find that you won't get very far.

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,500
Or you might invest in a platform

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
only to find users aren't there,

00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,890
with things like privacy breaches.

00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,890
But if you diversify,

00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,890
the fixed costs are going to go up for your platform.

00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,570
You might also choose to outsource some of the risk.

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So, there are great development environments like Unity

00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,830
which reduce the platform complexity equation for you.

00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:18,990
It's a great tool.

00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,300
We use Unity at Mozilla as well.

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,700
Tools might be attractive

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,830
but actually we have seen the risk in the past

00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,130
of tying our development platforms to proprietary tools.

00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,530
Any of you who work with the web

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,090
probably consider that logo as a dirty word, right?

00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,290
And the other thing is

00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,850
I would guess that most of you

00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,940
do not wish to establish a games development team

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,980
inside your business

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,980
just to reuse your existing content.

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,360
You have existing web content,

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,990
you have existing web development teams

00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,300
and you want the pipeline networks because

00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,660
just to apply it to a new application domain

00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,450
rather than having to make a large investment in tools

00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,120
that is difficult to pivot away from.

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,710
So, the answer of course, we believe, is to avoid walled gardens

00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,200
and to adopt standards-based platforms

00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,200
where there are multiple vendors.

00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,920
Going open-source, of course, has additional benefits for the users,

00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,500
if you choose to do that.

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,130
So, obviously we at Mozilla are strong advocates of the open approach

00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,530
and it might not seem immediately obvious

00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,110
how this intersects with mixed reality,

00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,790
but the open standards based approach of the web

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,540
has the ability to address many of these same things for mixed reality.

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,840
The Mozilla mission is a great fit

00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,340
for the need to protect creators and users of immersive experiences

00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,590
from the risks of platform lock-in and fragmentation.

00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,390
Apart from that, mixed reality experiences

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,680
build on some of the most intimate information about a user -

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,270
gaze, bodily motion and so on.

00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,900
It's our assertion that an open platform

00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,360
is the only way to protect that data from exploitation by bad actors

00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,870
and that's something we put at the heart of everything we do at Mozilla.

00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,160
So, how are we actually doing this?

00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,960
So, we're investing in a comprehensive open mixed reality strategy

00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,100
that covers user agents,

00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,900
content and tools,

00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,200
social,

00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,700
and standards and advocacy.

00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,700
So, key in this strategy

00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,480
is a suite of full featured browsers covering a range of platforms.

00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,610
We know that in order for the 3D web to be successful

00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,610
we need to avoid the mistakes of mobile

00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,360
and provide a full featured platform

00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,360
for deployment across different devices,

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,450
form factors

00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,950
and to optimize

00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,700
to allow developers to access the full capabilities of each platform.

00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,300
Secondly, we want to make it really easy

00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,460
to bring content to the 3D web.

00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,300
This includes creating frameworks and tools

00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,090
that allow for deployment or reuse of content from existing pipelines

00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,350
that allow users to discover that content

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,750
and we are also experimenting with

00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,250
some of the missing pieces of the business model

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,980
for web deployment, particularly for creative content.

00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,280
Thirdly, social mixed reality.

00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,860
This is where the true value of the web as a platform comes into play.

00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,490
Not only does this showcase the true value of an open platform

00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:52,250
but it's one of the areas that gets users most engaged.

00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,000
And the fourth often hidden area is standards and advocacy.

00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,200
Breaking down walled gardens

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,700
means investing time and effort in standardization.

00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,060
And this is not just a matter of creating a level playing field for vendors,

00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,600
it's also crucial in providing a platform

00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,300
on which to build features

00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,360
that can address things like accessibility by mixed reality techniques,

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,930
but have the power to which is not only open to the 3D web,

00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,430
but also the 2D web

00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,730
to users who might have traditionally been locked out from it.

00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,530
Mozilla is also a non-profit

00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,290
and it directly gives money back to these efforts

00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,040
through Mozilla Open Source Support Program,

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,140
which I will mention later.

00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,890
The browser is obviously a key piece in our user agency column.

00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:51,970
And our Firefox Reality browser for standalone VR headsets is our flagship.

00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,310
It's built by a great team at Mozilla.

00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,980
It uses the same full standards-based gecko rendering engine

00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,600
that you'll find in the desktop Firefox browser.

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,300
And it comes pre-installed in fact,

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,400
straight to VR headsets like those from HTC,

00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
a company headquartered here in Taiwan.

00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,830
Of course, because you are in VR,

00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,290
we allow you to view immersive video experiences

00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,550
delivered from sites like YouTube, Vimeo and others,

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,590
and so it's a great platform to deliver immersive video content on

00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,950
and we feature that content front and center

00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,650
every time the user puts on the device.

00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,180
Our next release Firefox Reality Version 6

00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,480
has got some features that we're really excited about,

00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,440
including one called Firefox Accounts

00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,200
which links Firefox from your VR devices

00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,200
to Firefox on iOS, Android, Mac and Windows machines,

00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,300
so it's really easily to get the content with the browser.

00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,690
The thing that makes it truly interesting to have a browser in VR

00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:01,210
of course is immersive interactive content delivered over the web.

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,340
This is made possible by the WebVR and the upcoming WebXR JavaScript APIs.

00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,050
With the WebVR and WebXR there's no app to install,

00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,350
you just browse to a VR enabled site and boom, you're in VR.

00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,800
We feature some really interesting examples of this kind of content

00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
on our Firefox Reality home page.

00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,800
There are some awesome applications out there.

00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,950
It's really an ideal platform for delivery of content in lot of areas.

00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,410
This is some of the VR.

00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,410
And some of them will blow you away.

00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,510
We're also interestingly seeing that

00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,900
some applications have transformative results

00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,400
beyond what we might expect.

00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,050
We have one of our team members who takes VR experiences

00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,200
into an aged care setting

00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,050
and we find that

00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,970
people who engage with this kind of content in aged care settings

00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,100
experience improvements in engagement,

00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,900
quality of life

00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,520
and mood, and a whole bunch of other things

00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,520
beyond what we might expect.

00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,480
For people who have lived full and active lives,

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,780
VR and mixed reality

00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,400
can help them to experience some of those things again.

00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:17,100
One other thing we're very proud of in our Firefox Reality product

00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,100
is the language support.

00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,630
We've worked really hard to build keyboards in a variety of scripts

00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,320
including pinyin, zhuyin.

00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,400
I am sorry I can't type with the zhuyin input method,

00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,600
so this is pinyin

00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,400
but hope you like New Zealand from the photos.

00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,800
It is nice to show you how easy it is to search

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
for nice places to visit.

00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,100
Of course, you know that typing in VR is hard

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,520
and sometimes annoying,

00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,860
so all of our language support,

00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:53,700
you can also access voice and full browser interface on it.

00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,900
We are also excited to try out in this area, novel interfaces

00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,900
as the devices begin to support them.

00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,670
For example, as eye tracking becomes more mainstream in VR devices,

00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,090
we may be able to try out gaze-based interfaces

00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:13,700
and it again opens up a whole new type of computing

00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:19,470
for people who might not care for normal accessibility to games VR.

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:26,610
So, from the second column on that slide, we have content and tools.

00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,610
In this area we are working really hard

00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,300
because we know that having a good pipeline

00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,000
to get content onto the web

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,600
and to allow users to discover

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,990
is really critical to the success of the 3D web.

00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,120
Mozilla in the past has made some great contributions

00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,700
building frameworks for 3D on the web

00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,000
and has got some awesome new work in this area.

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,970
We also work to build partnerships with companies across the web

00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,000
to ensure that our browsers have a great publishing platform

00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
for their tools and content

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,200
including names such as Amazon,

00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,200
...Microsoft, Sketchfab...

00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,800
many, many others, large and small.

00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,980
So, if you have content and you would like us to feature,

00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,980
please make contact.

00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,280
The work in the ECSY project

00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,000
which is a brand new publication for Mozilla

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,600
builds on our earlier work for frameworks

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
such as Three.js for rendering

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,960
and A-Frame for VR based on the document object model,

00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,750
using declarative component system.

00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,750
Any of you who've got a background in game design

00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,680
will recognize entity component systems,

00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,000
approach to data driven design with an emphasis on performance,

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,500
and small API status.

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,270
So, ECSY is an experimental framework written in pure JavaScript

00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,480
and it is graphics engine agnostic

00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,700
and then the community that is building apps around this

00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,800
is busy integrating a variety of engines,

00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
some of which you can see.

00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
If you're a developer

00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,620
I highly recommend reading the recent blog posts in this area

00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,330
which introduces the framework and its architecture.

00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:14,590
So, the third project I'd really like to introduce to you is Hubs,

00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,220
this is Mozilla's web-based social VR platform.

00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,800
Hubs is one of those great projects

00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,640
that ties together all the other pieces of our mixed reality program.

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,940
It's a 100% web-based,

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,340
it runs on a regular web browser,

00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,140
a browser you got sitting on your knee,

00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,060
or in your pocket

00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,570
as well as head-worn devices.

00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,050
So, Hubs has a feature set

00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,250
that allows you to do really the same kind of things

00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,990
you'd want to do in a face-to-face meeting online.

00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,960
You can use a microphone to talk or hear others,

00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,750
you can engage with all the privacy controls.

00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,300
You can create rooms from a library of different scenes

00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,700
or create your own

00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,800
from customer elements in the online Spoke editor

00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
which is a cool tool of its own.

00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,700
We're constantly amazed by the scenes that the people in our community build.

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,200
If you want to, you can re-create a windowless conference room,

00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,100
a crazy live conference floor

00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,600
or if you want to do something a bit more zany

00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
like the ...

00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,000
So, Hubs is avatar and bodied communication,

00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,500
research shows that it's a great way

00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
to break down some of the barriers

00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,460
for people who have to be online in a virtual space.

00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,260
You can apply all kinds of cool customization to your avatar

00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,000
to make it uniquely representing.

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,200
But the real power of Hubs is that it's just the web

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
and so you have the vast content of the web

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
that you can bring into your rooms,

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,500
3D models from a variety of sources,

00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,270
video files, live streams.

00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,480
Once things are set up the way you like,

00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,000
you get people into your room.

00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,780
Hubs integrates with Discord for great access management,

00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,650
so you can create private rooms and moderate them

00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,650
and build a community around the space.

00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,750
So, we've got some great features coming up

00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,750
aimed at enterprise use of Hubs,

00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,500
holding business meetings and that kind of thing,

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,500
or in the meantime just have a lot of fun.

00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:25,180
So, jump online now and try the Hubs at hubs.mozilla.com.

00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,600
So, I mentioned the fourth critical piece of standards and advocacy

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,100
that we are working on at Mozilla.

00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,730
So, the big news in this area is the WebXR API

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,730
which we are collaboratively developing

00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,930
with many other browser vendors

00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:45,450
including Google, Microsoft, Oculus, Magic Leap, and Samsung

00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,450
and many other interested parties,

00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:54,020
HTC, NTT, Softbank, Amazon... many others,

00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,220
representing a full spectrum of people interested in mostly content.

00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,820
That's run under the auspices of

00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,700
the W3C’s immersive web working group.

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,010
So, you could try the features of WebXR now

00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,600
via our polyfill library

00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
which builds on top of WebVR

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,730
but our goal is to provide initial WebXR VR support this December

00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:24,860
and support similar time to other browser vendors.

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,700
There will be multi-platform multi-vendor support

00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,800
right at the start of the availability of WebXR.

00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,000
The WebXR’s VR approaches are just a start,

00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,590
WebXR includes a modular approach covering input devices,

00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,590
augmented reality,

00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,700
permissive accessibility...

00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,430
If any of you are familiar with the approach taken by the WebVR API,

00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,700
you'll find WebXR very accessible.

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,100
I am not going to try and cover a working example on this one,

00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,320
but I will take you to the various examples page.

00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,400
The first example there is models in VR experience,

00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,200
it's only 100 lines of JavaScript,

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,700
so it's super simple.

00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
My colleague at Mozilla, Eric Shepherd

00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,500
has started work on some great WebXR documentation

00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
for the Mozilla Developer Network.

00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,500
I invite you all to take a look.

00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,090
Some really great material there

00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:28,800
which helps with understanding the background

00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
and the full WebXR pipeline.

00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,000
In architectural terms,

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,980
WebXR sits on a stack with several related APIs,

00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,100
the most important of which is WebGL,

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,150
since WebXR API assumes rendering is done

00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,740
to a frame buffer in a symmetric way.

00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,660
Most applications will directly use WebGL

00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:58,460
or be built on high level API provided by the library,

00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,840
in particular Three.js or some graphics library

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,300
to provide higher level abstractions of components like,

00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,240
concept like projections, viewers or models

00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,100
or you could go for a framework like A-Frame

00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,560
which adds a complete declarative DOM based scene model,

00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,940
also handles abstraction such as viewer position and orientation

00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,900
and provides with means to query for those from the WebXR API.

00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,400
Underneath - obviously the browser is a key piece here

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:41,100
that translates the API’s JavaScript calls into native calls

00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,730
and run on variety of platforms.

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,200
So, we do the hard work of simplifying the platform space for you.

00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,180
Different manufacturers have different ways of talking to the sensors,

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,180
different types of sensors,

00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,980
so we also of course handle all the interactions

00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,180
with the graphics APIs

00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,900
needed to get the images from your drawing

00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,700
to the frame buffer

00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,200
for each eye as quickly as possible.

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,410
So, we know that developing and debugging WebXR isn't easy

00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:18,740
especially because you might lack access to the platform or devices.

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,670
So, we've created the WebXR emulator browser add-on

00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,670
which allows you to view

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,090
the immersive VR content right on your desktop browser,

00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,090
the one you are using for developing.

00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,090
So, once you've installed this,

00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:37,600
you’ll find a new tab in Firefox Developer tools labeled WebXR

00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,400
and from here if you navigate to a page that has WebXR enabled,

00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,100
for example, the immersive web samples page,

00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,770
you see an option to enter XR.

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,570
You will be presented with a first person view of the immersive environment

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,490
and the third person view of the emulated device and its controllers

00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:03,100
where you can move the device or you can wave hands around, activate the different inputs

00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,900
and trigger the actions that the WebXR code exposes.

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,200
The support for both three degree of freedom

00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,800
and full six degree of freedom devices

00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,900
with one or two controllers as well as some of the simple cardboard-based actions.

00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,560
So please download it and try it out.

00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:26,800
I also would like to draw your attention to

00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,000
Mozilla's Open Source Support Program.

00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,780
Every year Mozilla puts millions of dollars

00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,780
into the hands of open source projects

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,200
to help build resilience and capacity

00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,950
and this great big experiment that we call the open web.

00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,040
So, the same with different categories of support,

00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,630
one that’s really accessible is the Foundational Technology Track,

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,100
so that means if you are building software

00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,100
that gets built into a Mozilla product

00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,700
or gets used internally by Mozilla,

00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,800
you should consider applying for MOSS grant.

00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,470
Process is not onerous,

00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,370
we make awards every two months,

00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,370
there’s still one more awards round this year

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,200
and we have got a variety of different projects for fundamental tooling,

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,150
through things like various touch and mixed reality programs.

00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,850
So, Hubs for example,

00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,000
includes meeting with different web libraries

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,950
and we support some of those through MOSS.

00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,920
So, finally on the topic of WebXR

00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,800
I’d like to give you a sneak preview of some truly amazing work

00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
from two of my colleagues at Mozilla,

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,970
Diego Goberna and Fernando Serrano.

00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:47,850
So, what you're seeing is a showcase for tools and techniques of WebXR

00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,450
of the highest quality.

00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:55,030
So, we think that a library of amazing user experience and design patents

00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,200
is necessary for the healthy growth of WebXR.

00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,530
This experience called Hello WebXR!

00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,530
When the full version is released,

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,530
we know you're going to be amazed.

00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,800
Best part is that

00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,830
this whole thing is going to be available for you to take apart,

00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,530
pick up and reuse.

00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,530
So, I am really excited to develop some techniques

00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:19,700
that we hope to see and more experiences to come.

00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,100
So, you're amongst some of the first people to see this preview.

00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,800
This is not yet released,

00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,980
but please, if you would like to try it out for yourself,

00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:35,200
jump on the website, mixedreality.mozilla.org

00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,150
and keep an eye out on our blog.

00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,400
Some of these things are really fun.

00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,490
Looking forward to sharing with you.

00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,330
So, that really concludes my presentation.

00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:52,900
I hope through my talk you've gained a little bit of insight

00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,900
into why we think mixed reality is important.

00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,500
And we know that it's going to sweep away

00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,380
lot of existing computing devices in this area

00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,780
and we certainly hope that you'll join us in making this journey happen.

00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,780
