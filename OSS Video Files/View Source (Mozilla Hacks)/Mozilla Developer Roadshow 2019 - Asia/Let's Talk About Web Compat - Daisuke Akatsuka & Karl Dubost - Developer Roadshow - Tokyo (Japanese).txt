Hello

00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,780
My English is not very good,

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,180
and my Japanese is much better so I'll speak in Japanese.

00:04:32,045 --> 00:04:34,195
Today, it is my turn 

00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:36,945
to tell you about

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,500
web compatibility and DevTools.

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,720
This is currently in development.

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,000
As Karl mentioned,

00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,160
this is an important tool

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,300
for assessing web compatibility.

00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,380
For myself,

00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,820
when investigating why my CSS properties,

00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,820
HTML tags,

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,880
or JavaScript APIs

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,120
have gone missing,

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,920
or do not show up on my browser,

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,000
to check that

00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,180
for all the properties

00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,560
is extremely troublesome.

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
Therefore, 

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,680
I am developing a tool

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,940
to solve these problems.

00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,435
Before I go into that,

00:05:19,435 --> 00:05:22,885
I would like to talk about DevTools.

00:05:23,095 --> 00:05:26,125
You guys probably know this,

00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,460
but Firefox has a tool called DevTools,

00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,160
which is

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,040
targeted at web developers.

00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,640
How many of you use this?

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,560
That's great.

00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,380
So what is this tool about?

00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,860
It is used to inspect

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,460
webpages - 

00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,100
its internal structure,

00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,500
styles,

00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,720
network and performance,

00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,480
and anything else related to the web

00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,080
that appears in the browser.

00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,560
More specifically,

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,840
let's see -

00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:10,875
I have DevTools open,

00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,055
so you can see the webpage,

00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,640
body,

00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,060
everything

00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,640
by session.

00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,860
And you can see 

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,260
the contents in every session,

00:06:26,445 --> 00:06:29,635
and the structure of the webpage.

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,700
Not only can you inspect it,

00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,160
but you can also make

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,260
some adjustments and changes to it.

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,960
For example,

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,340
the colour here is grey, 

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
let's say I wanted to

00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,660
change it

00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,880
to pink,

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,240
or change the font,

00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:57,505
by increasing the font weight.

00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,580
You would be able to make these changes using the tool.

00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,940
So in summary, Dev Tools 

00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,460
allows you to inspect,

00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,420
and adjust things,

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,795
and these changes

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,980
will appear on the actual webpage.

00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,880
So it helps the 

00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,880
web development process

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,140
become smoother.

00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,120
That's one of the things it does.

00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,280
Today, I would like to cover

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,360
the new functions and settings in DevTools.

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,620
You can do many things 

00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,240
with DevTools, 

00:07:39,245 --> 00:07:41,595
so I will talk about some of them.

00:07:41,915 --> 00:07:42,915
The first is,

00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,500
Inactive CSS,

00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,340
and the other is Changes.

00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,060
I will talk about 

00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,635
these two now.

00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,300
So, inactive CSS -

00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,340
for example,

00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,380
there's an image here

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,640
which you would like to centralise.

00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:06,935
What can you do?

00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,400
The image is wrapped in the figure,

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,020
which is wrapped in the div,

00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,780
so you would need to centralise it in the div.

00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,780
There are a few ways to go about it.

00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,040
For example,

00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,340
you can use the property align-items.

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,920
So if you change this 

00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,560
to center,

00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,780
the image should be centralised.

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,460
But it's not working.

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,620
Instead, here,

00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,860
you get a pop-up.

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,680
If you click on the icon,

00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,680
it says that align-items

00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,200
needs to have a container

00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,420
flex or grid,

00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,020
otherwise there will be no effect.

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,680
So here,

00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,060
I'm going to add 

00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,920
flex,

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,560
and now, 

00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,280
the image is centralised.

00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,840
Let me give you 

00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,000
one other example - 

00:09:17,545 --> 00:09:18,545
let's take this,

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,200
which is wrapped by a link.

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,500
The place that says visited,

00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:27,515
is linked to the number of visitors to the site.

00:09:27,515 --> 00:09:29,515
I'm going to change the colour

00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:30,835
to blue.

00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:32,180
It works fine.

00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,405
So,

00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,020
now,

00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,680
I'm going to try to make it

00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,440
slightly bigger,

00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,280
which doesn't work.

00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,240
Why doesn't it work?

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,000
If you take a look at this,

00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,900
it says that 'visited',

00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,080
due to privacy reasons,

00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:58,715
the styles that can be modified using this selector 

00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:02,185
are very limited.

00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,240
Due to this restriction,

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,180
properties like this one

00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,060
might not work.

00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,075
In this way, inactive CSS

00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,500
tells those of you developing webpages

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,140
what doesn't work,

00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,380
or is useless,

00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,860
and what you can do

00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,100
to achieve certain effects.

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,120
It is a tool with detailed functions

00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:30,625
to tell you that.

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,360
Let's look at another example.

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
This is

00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,640
Changes.

00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,180
Question:

00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,680
what did I change here?

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,640
I won't be able to tell.

00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,600
Even if I make many adjustments,

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,460
and changes using the tool,

00:10:56,415 --> 00:10:59,195
I forget what I've done.

00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,940
And when you're making a webpage,

00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,000
that is pretty problematic.

00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,960
For this, we have Changes.

00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,560
As you can see from here,

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,800
Changes tells me

00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,260
all the changes

00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:15,475
that I have made,

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,500
by displaying them here.

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,500
By looking at this,

00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,820
and reflecting them on my page,

00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,020
the changes are clearer to me.

00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,900
Another useful thing here is 

00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,220
there is a button 

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,540
called 'copy all changes'.

00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,360
I just clicked it.

00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,600
And by doing this,

00:11:41,815 --> 00:11:43,885
I am pasting it here.

00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:47,705
So what I've just copied and pasted,

00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,740
all the changes I've made in CSS just now,

00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,300
can be downloaded

00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,000
to text.

00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,380
This is useful

00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,980
when I am developing websites by myself,

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,980
as I would like to know

00:12:03,435 --> 00:12:06,815
which parts I have changed.

00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:09,445
But it's also useful for web designers,

00:12:09,505 --> 00:12:12,505
when they use DevTools

00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,295
to make adjustments,

00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:17,025
to deliver them to someone else.

00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:20,015
Before, maybe you would have to take screenshots,

00:12:20,195 --> 00:12:22,765
or write a huge chunk

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,340
of text,

00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,500
to explain what you have done.

00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,125
Now,

00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,460
you would be able to hand this over

00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,420
to the developers.

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,000
We are interested in 

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,860
being able to share these changes,

00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,660
so we developed

00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,440
this tool.

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,900
What else?

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,900
I would like to cover this.

00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,800
This is a compatibility sidebar.

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,320
This is a tool that allows me to 

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,960
troubleshoot problems

00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,300
in the element

00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,420
I have just selected.

00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
For example,

00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,040
where my name is,

00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,180
if we inspect this,

00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,600
there's one problem.

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,800
I'm using the property

00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,940
padding-inline,

00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,795
but this property is experimental,

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,020
and may not be supported

00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,320
in other browsers.

00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,300
If I look at this here,

00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,140
it's not supported in Safari.

00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,140
If I open it in Safari,

00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,260
of course,

00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,420
it's not supported, 

00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,640
which is a shame.

00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,980
What can we do?

00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,800
I can, for example,

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
using a padding shorthand

00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,580
to do this, 

00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,600
so that it appears

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,920
in every page,

00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:05,465
or browser.

00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:07,765
Or, I can

00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,260
For this image,

00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,560
I'm actually using clip,

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,920
but this function 

00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,180
will be deprecated soon.

00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,140
With clip

00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,280
I'm going use it 

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,320
to make this large image

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,420
slightly smaller.

00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,540
It's a concern

00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,560
that it will be deprecated.

00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,020
It says 'not recommended'.

00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,560
'Please try 

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,600
using clip-path instead'.

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,400
That's what it says.

00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,900
So let me try 

00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,100
using clip-path.

00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,555
And the issue disappears,

00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,420
but the value for the rect function

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,420
is invalid.

00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,780
So let me look around

00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,020
for something 

00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
that might be useful.

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,520
Hm -

00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,440
it seems 

00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:14,285
different from what I expected.

00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,880
Something like this.

00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,280
It gives the feeling that you can do something 

00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,760
with this clip-path function.

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,240
You can use it 

00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,080
in any page or browser.

00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,160
And just to show you another new tool

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,600
in DevTools,

00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,680
there is a shape-editor,

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,980
which you can use to make changes

00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,400
to these kinds of shapes.

00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,220
For example, you can make this triangle shape.

00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,620
And - 

00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,000
there's this property

00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,235
called shape-outside.

00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,760
If you do this,

00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,240
the text that was wrapped around the shape,

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,180
now becomes wrapped

00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,200
around the triangle.

00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,960
Like this.

00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,260
So you can make your text

00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,820
flow around an image.

00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,480
So I've reached the end of my talk,

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,980
but I am always discovering

00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,640
problematic areas

00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:38,175
like this,

00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,120
reading documents and figuring out solutions,

00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:45,125
so that we can provide

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,860
the same experience

00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,960
on different web browsers.

00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,680
And I hope you can use it frequently

00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,060
and become connected with us.

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,840
I would be happy 

00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,920
if everyone can create beautiful websites.

00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,280
That's all I have for today.

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,940
Also,

00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,920
DevTools is constantly

00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,980
developing new things,

00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,215
and tweeting about it

00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,600
on this Twitter account,

00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,540
so please check it out.

00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,040
That's all.

00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,640
