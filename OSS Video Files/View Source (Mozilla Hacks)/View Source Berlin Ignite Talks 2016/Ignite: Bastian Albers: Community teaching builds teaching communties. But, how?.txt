	00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:13,969
yeah so hello I want to talk to you

00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:16,370
about teaching and teaching what kind of

00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:18,680
people yeah as you can guess from this

00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,080
diverse bunch of people here programmers

00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,420
and I don't want to teach the next

00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:27,310
Zuckerberg I want programmers to look

00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:30,050
like this a bit more at least and I

00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,760
can't go too much into how do you

00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,559
produce better diversity there's

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,879
fantastic talks about that but I can

00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:36,890
tell you a bit about learning and

00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:38,570
teaching and how the community is built

00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,980
around it so when it comes to

00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,309
programming and learning it it's all

00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:45,079
about bridging that gap that gap between

00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:47,390
understanding a concept and be actually

00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:49,280
able to realize it and that gap between

00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,699
the people who have the technology and

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,679
those who don't have it and you can

00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:57,079
reach like you can close a lot of that

00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:59,449
gap in a one-day event we just bring

00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:01,670
those people together and guide them

00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:03,199
through the first steps of creating a

00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,409
bit of software that actually does

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,990
something and railsbridge and rails

00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:11,689
girls they really excelled with that and

00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:14,090
a lot of others came and took that

00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:15,590
concept of one-day event like jungle

00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,180
girls closer bridge and I'm involve

00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,860
result in tech school in CSS classes

00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,680
where we do a lot of those one day

00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,590
workshops asked me about it afterwards

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,509
like there's a lot more than those so at

00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,340
those events people come and they learn

00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:30,530
at their own pace with workshop

00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,600
materials that are that they have on

00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,939
their computers and on their computers

00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,560
they create hands on a bit of software

00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:38,990
and coaches are there to help and

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,530
unblock them so you need some learners

00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:44,390
which might seem very easy to get them

00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,039
but sometimes it's a bit hard depending

00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,649
on where you are so you have to work to

00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:50,179
get good learners and for coaches it's

00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:52,789
not that hard if you can tap into

00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:55,909
existing communities most of them will

00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:58,189
help as well with space they will help

00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:00,500
as well a lot of them or companies might

00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:02,240
give you their spaces for free you can

00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,219
create materials but that is a lot of

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,649
work but the beauty is you can reuse

00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:11,180
those materials globally if you share

00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:13,250
them so this is a quote from the open

00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,290
tech school teaching guidelines assume

00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,180
everyone you're coaching has zero

00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,709
knowledge but infinite intelligence and

00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,270
that's how you should always approach

00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:22,860
your learners

00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:24,750
because its heart like there's a

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,790
fantastic text by Kelsey Bray's man

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,590
about how learning to program is a lot

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,750
like learning construction you don't

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,430
start by building a house you start by

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,110
building boxes and you don't know all

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,970
those tools like why are there ten

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,850
hammers what are they for you have no

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,520
clue when you start so you build box

00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:44,700
after box after box and then you feel a

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,580
bit more comfortable and start

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,520
appreciating what the tools are for it's

00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,350
not just a switch you can turn on so

00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,170
programming is like that you don't just

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:57,239
switch and get it so we realized there's

00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,520
a lot of people who came back to the

00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,170
same events so we were like oh so we

00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,480
need to create something new something

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:06,230
maybe weekly or bi-weekly so we came up

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,480
with co-learning where we just said okay

00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:11,310
people come we pick a topic and we asked

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,860
them what do you want to achieve tonight

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,230
and really force everyone to answer

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,480
which isn't working for everyone that

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:21,810
well but people automatically pair up

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,970
and teach each other so sometimes we

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,070
felt like we don't even need to be there

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,440
like because everyone learns and

00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:30,330
everyone teaches it each other and you

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,920
don't need materials or an agenda so

00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,900
it's something you can actually sustain

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,700
when you want to do it on a weekly basis

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,670
so you just need a space where everyone

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,640
gathers and teaches it each other so you

00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:43,470
need those learners and they come and go

00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,100
and some of them keep sticking around

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:49,049
and maybe help you organizing and help

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,570
you coach because they coaches are each

00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:53,549
other and you really need that because

00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:56,400
you need like weekly rent you need a

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:58,739
rotation and some some coaches who can

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,590
help you run that so learners become

00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,090
organizers and coaches and you might

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,790
lose them as well like we had a learner

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,170
who became a coach and then moved to

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,750
another country because you got a job

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:12,299
there so this brings me to what my last

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,190
concept she codes for my colleague of

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,200
mine started that he wanted to build a

00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,930
learning platform to get more women into

00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,770
programming so he started doing

00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:24,630
materials to get to that and started

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,000
focus groups in his kitchen way taught

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,250
those materials and when they were

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,080
through with those first materials they

00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,160
were like a what now so he continued

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,830
coaching

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,050
and then he came up with a new concept

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:40,440
how to sustain that he said okay when

00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,360
you're ready for a job I coach you for

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,270
free until then but then you continue

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,910
learning with me and your employer will

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:50,640
pay for it and it took him two years but

00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:53,160
now he got there and three of his

00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,740
learner's are now in jobs and two of

00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,330
those continue learning with him and the

00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,250
employer pays and for one of them you

00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,860
got a referral fee so it's actually

00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:04,140
possible to do that in a sustainable way

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,270
and I found that very inspiring to see

00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,060
that he took his privilege and invested

00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:12,980
the time to get those from there so

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,980
