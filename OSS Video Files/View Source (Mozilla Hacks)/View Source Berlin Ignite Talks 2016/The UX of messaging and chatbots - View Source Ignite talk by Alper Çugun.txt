hi um I'm currently writing a book about

00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:15,369
the idea that chat bots are going to be

00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:17,350
the future of applications and the book

00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:22,210
is going to be about how to design for

00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:24,250
this new future the future of chat is

00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:27,580
sort of this image where the ideal

00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:29,289
amazon family is huddled around device

00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,720
and they're trying to interact with it

00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:33,190
in a natural language way and the device

00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,640
will provide everything that they've

00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:38,260
ever wanted to do to their lives but

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,570
it's just one possible future really

00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,580
because another possible future is this

00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,860
one where we will glue screens to our

00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,810
eyes and our overlords will be walking

00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:50,590
behind us to control whatever we will

00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,940
see on those screens and there's even

00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:55,750
another possible future that's already

00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,670
here and has is like sort of unevenly

00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,770
distributed is where screens will be

00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,690
everywhere in the world around us so

00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,610
these different futures compete with

00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,830
each other in many ways and none of them

00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,060
really is going to win but I think

00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,860
they're all going to going to be with us

00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,960
for a while but then it's then the

00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,490
question is like what about apps apps

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,020
were going to be the future right you

00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,729
know I've heard so many business people

00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:19,390
shouting to their phones they need apps

00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:22,539
apps apps and this doesn't really bode

00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:24,759
well for them um apps are doing well

00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:28,060
right now with technologies like react

00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:31,060
native who are that are really brilliant

00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,340
and are making creating apps a great

00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,369
experience for developers and users and

00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,539
are finally bringing this web

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,090
sensibility to the to the smartphones

00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:41,939
but for some businesses having an app is

00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,170
not really necessary anymore at all

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,030
Patagonia are just now sunset their

00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,310
application because I said we've got a

00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,840
really good website so this app is no

00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:55,840
longer necessary I couldn't find a penny

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:58,959
more so the web yes mission accomplished

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,389
am i right I mean the open web has

00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,689
prevailed and we have one and everything

00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:07,810
can happen on the on the free internet

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:10,680
well I think this little guy might have

00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:13,209
something to say about that the original

00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,489
conversational interface spruced up

00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:19,060
wizards brought to you by our great

00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:19,870
Microsoft a wizard that has still is

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,000
somewhat

00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,549
body which makes it a you know such a

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,049
nice figure and has now researched in

00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:28,180
our lives with slack pot which is

00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:31,540
nothing but a sort of a spruced-up

00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,190
Clippy it's in your office context it

00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,209
promises to make you more efficient and

00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:42,250
make your life more fun but in the end I

00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:46,060
think it's kind of yeah yeah so we made

00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:48,640
some chat BOTS last year not slack once

00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,500
but different ones but last year we

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,810
couldn't have really predicted how this

00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,280
space would explode right now like this

00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,959
the charge your swords are all the

00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,879
applications and platforms that are out

00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,920
there right now one of them is for

00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:01,629
instance layer which gives you a tool

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,299
kit so you don't have to design and

00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:06,340
develop your own messaging you I it's

00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:08,799
that's very useful they also provide the

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,379
back end another one is for instance i

00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:12,970
think is converted AI which is a sort of

00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:14,620
a drag-and-drop tool where you can

00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,609
create your chat flow so designers have

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,769
always been asking me what's the

00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:19,930
photoshop for chat gonna be well i think

00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:22,959
this comes along this is a long way in

00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,099
the right direction another one is for

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,989
instance going up on the stack is

00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:28,150
something like with AI there's a bunch

00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:29,889
of these out now we're really powerful

00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,380
natural language processing technology

00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:34,690
is now available and accessible easily

00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,579
and you can even have open source

00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,950
version of these that you can drop into

00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:41,230
your project and there are entire

00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,180
platforms that nobody has ever heard of

00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,190
or used like I don't know anybody who's

00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,019
this telegram but they've got like tons

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,299
of users then there's a bunch of these

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:51,910
and they also have like huge facilities

00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:53,769
for conversational interfaces and bots

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,480
that are on the platform and in the end

00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:57,280
all these BOTS what does it amount to I

00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,660
mean we saw the example already you can

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,780
buy a plane ticket or you can order

00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:04,870
pizza when in the the conversational

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:07,810
commerce approach where yeah you buys

00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:10,299
the thing gives you stuff to buy but a

00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,190
bit more a bit better would be for

00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:14,470
instance the Mars both example by four

00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,180
square which knows you which has a long

00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,910
lasting relationship it knows your data

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,280
it knows your history and it recommends

00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:24,220
you stuff that you could enjoy places

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,039
nearby that might be nice and Mars bot

00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:29,169
is a type of AI it's a very fin AI I

00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:31,120
mean it's a restaurant AI and there are

00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:33,129
a I said are stupider than that and that

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,939
our eyes that are smarter than that

00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:38,409
and the old Jose is our are in those

00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:41,830
chat boards and I think that's what chat

00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:44,379
bots are right now they are 22 AI what

00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,300
the light bulb was to electrification so

00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:49,149
chat bots are the first ubiquitous

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,860
accessible manifestation of AI that we

00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:55,479
can actually touch and do things with

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:57,339
and that will grow further so an open

00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:00,729
problem in chat BOTS right now is

00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:02,919
creating an interface that is more

00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:04,479
pleasurable to talk to and more

00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:06,519
efficient to get stuff done with and

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,929
once we get that interface I mean just

00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:10,439
like this who would ever want to talk to

00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:10,439
