hi everyone there's two things you need

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,560
to know about me first of all this that

00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:17,410
I'm Dutch a second of all I'm becoming a

00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:22,180
sentimental old fool I combine both of

00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:25,270
these by using a no change with a slight

00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:28,599
not using the bicycle route network of

00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:30,700
Holland it was designed for recreational

00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:37,720
signing in the countryside and rolled

00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:39,399
out between 2003 and 2012 the network is

00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,710
point-to-point between two neighboring

00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:44,140
nodes there's complete signage and no

00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:52,600
gaps to get you from one to the other

00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:54,760
and this works in both directions you

00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,579
see some of the signs there's an

00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,829
implicit promise nice routes which means

00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:02,649
away from cars as much as possible and

00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:08,590
scenic which includes fields heath and

00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:11,500
forest using the nodes local networks

00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:13,960
have been designed and built it's purely

00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,670
infrastructural there's no preconception

00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,790
of proper or typical usage and

00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:23,830
accommodates roots of any shape in any

00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:25,870
length every route has a note has a

00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,280
local map with a network on it you can

00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:30,340
use it for planning reference and

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,960
assurance besides you can use paper maps

00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:39,160
apps and websites for planning and

00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:40,840
sharing local networks have been knitted

00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,460
together to a national network and

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,060
looking at the map i see interesting

00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:48,280
differences in pendants and densities it

00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:53,500
reflects the geography but i think also

00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:56,200
the the character of the local people it

00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,970
wasn't always national to roll out over

00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,040
nine years one local network at the time

00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:03,970
I still remember crossing a province

00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:09,099
border and no more network so back to

00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:10,899
maps and finding streets the Dutch did

00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:13,569
not invent the system you have to go

00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:16,090
back 1980s Northeast Belgium all coal

00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:19,050
mines are closing mining engineer who

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:23,730
gobelins proposes cycling network to

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,960
regenerate the area ears who go he

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,300
designed the network rules that

00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,590
explained in this talk Belgian had to

00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,960
actually build or recycling

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,210
infrastructure so took to 1995 to open

00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:37,610
the first local network but now it's a

00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:40,650
makes 17 million a year for the region I

00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:42,780
got curious about the total number of

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,100
network nodes in Holland I couldn't find

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,740
this on the Internet the internet is

00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:49,170
quite short on stats and data when comes

00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:54,180
to the network so I had to do something

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:56,940
else I took one of my maps counting the

00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,350
number of node 309 then multiplied by

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,500
the number of maps that cover Holland

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:04,020
then I took 75 percent of that number to

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:08,280
deal with map overlaps and my own over

00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:10,680
enthusiasm about the theme so is the

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,540
winning number the reason I got curious

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,820
is that every time use the network I'm

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,200
impressed by a real genius design

00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:23,220
decision and I don't get to say that

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:25,200
very often and which really matters all

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,420
of these nearly 10,000 nodes have been

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,540
identified by a two digit number not

00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,580
four or five here would exist it simply

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:36,470
all nodes are numbered 1 through 99 and

00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:39,750
then they started one again and shorter

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:41,400
is much better it's much faster to read

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,380
and write down better to memorize short

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,930
term it's instant in comparing confirm

00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:54,120
and remember all of this has to be done

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:55,500
in anger on a bicycle pushing through

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,239
the two-digit number must have been

00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,370
asking for a lot of trouble most of us

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,930
can just imagine the bag shedding what

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,530
if cycle a really need to identify a

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:09,150
note in the nation will people get

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:11,010
confused by changing numbers so this old

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,140
cycling sign pound size of five digit

00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,630
numbers take several steps to process

00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:18,720
two digits are humane numbers and

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:23,370
exploits that way finding is basically a

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:26,160
very local activity that you do wrapping

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:28,680
up a cycling network is a distributed

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,840
network that's the one on the right all

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,289
the notes are equal and also so are all

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,719
the routes

00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:38,909
and cyclists root mice themselves it's

00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:40,559
quite a bit like the internet so we

00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:42,839
could call it the Democratic network

00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:44,819
because it treats everybody s equals or

00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:46,619
we could call it an air liberal network

00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:50,159
because yeah we'll be very for Dutch

00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:53,849
thing or postmodern we could call it the

00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:55,379
atomized network but I I call it a

00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:58,219
bicycle route network of the nelons

00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:58,219
