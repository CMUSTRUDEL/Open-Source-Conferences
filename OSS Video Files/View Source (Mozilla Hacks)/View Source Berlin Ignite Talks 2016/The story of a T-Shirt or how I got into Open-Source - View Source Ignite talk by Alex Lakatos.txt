00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,730
and I'm a Muslim reps volunteer what

00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,460
that means is i'm basically volunteer

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,380
who helps other people volunteer i'm

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,570
going to tell you a little story about

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:26,900
the t-shirt and how that got me involved

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:29,400
in open source about six years back my

00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:32,430
chain my slides ever-changing i hope

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,050
that's okay i can continue on without so

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,410
about six years ago I was fresh out of

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,830
college i am from romania and they grew

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:43,500
up in romania that means that x seen

00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:45,510
there it's all based on outsourcing

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,580
without sourcing means is you basically

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,040
get rented or leased out to other

00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,379
companies for your basically for your

00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,839
software skills so it looking for my

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:58,470
first job i found one and outsourcing

00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:59,909
and i started out working with a company

00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:03,089
that there's trips and stuff like that

00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:05,790
tripit maybe you heard of it about three

00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:08,280
weeks into my into my job my manager

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,080
took me aside and said you know what we

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,810
have this company called mozilla that we

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,180
work with and you're gonna go join their

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,799
team and i was like i don't like change

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,180
what are you talking about i just joined

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,130
the other company and I the only know

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,600
thing I know about Mozilla is they kind

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,850
of make this browser i use called

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,829
firefox and that's it what's open source

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,200
volunteering wasn't basically in my

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:34,079
vocabulary back then so we had to make a

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,390
deal i was going to stay with a new team

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,549
for about two weeks until he got someone

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,079
to replace me and then I was going to

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,740
move back with her that he might feel

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,659
comfortable with when I joined I kind of

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,869
felt like an outsider like I didn't

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,329
belong because i joined around the time

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,130
we are releasing Firefox for which was a

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:55,409
good time like it was easy to get

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,689
excited about the project but just just

00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,359
the week before i joined everyone got

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:02,820
these t-shirts that said firefox for

00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,399
beta tester and I didn't get the t-shirt

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,530
so I felt left out and on top of that

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,080
they were a team of testers I kind of

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,790
wanted to be a developer when I grow up

00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:15,000
which didn't help as well so I kind of

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,740
feel felt like an outsider of course my

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,290
manager didn't really keep up his part

00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:22,800
of the bargain stuff happens but up

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,840
about a month into my menu new job

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,520
I was reading something called the

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,070
muslin it which is kind of a blog

00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,710
aggregator that's where stuff comes up

00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,600
new features it's basically if there's

00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:37,320
basically helping me with my job right

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,510
so I read that and I heard I saw a story

00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,360
that said the Mossad developer network

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,520
was having a documentation sprint over

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,620
the weekend 48 hours and if you

00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,440
contributed you got a t-shirt and that I

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,210
had my hair moment I was like yes not

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,470
only am I am I gonna fit into the team

00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm gonna be better because I get a

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:57,000
developer t-shirt they have testers

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,560
t-shirt it I had the plan it it was

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,770
going to all work out it was it was

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,480
perfect so I so I told i told my friends

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,950
I was like look I need to do this thing

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,930
for about a couple of hours and then we

00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,610
can go out party have a good time I was

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,340
fresh out of college in with money what

00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,870
do you expect so I joined out the

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,910
documentation streams and then something

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:19,440
happened the success is something just

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:22,020
changed because unlike my my job I kind

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,790
of felt accepted that everyone greeted

00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,920
him when i joined the IRC channel I know

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,290
we're still old for old school and we

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,420
use IRC everybody showed me how to

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:33,270
contribute everybody was super nice

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,220
about it and the two hours that was

00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:37,350
supposed to happen we're kind of like 48

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:41,190
hours it turns out you don't really need

00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:43,470
that much sleep in 48 hours it's okay my

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,720
friends kept calling me like let's get

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,790
out let's have fun of like you don't

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,540
understand I'm having fun here with a

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:53,160
bunch of people I met over the Internet

00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,590
Indiana my god Indiana got my t-shirt my

00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,570
developing t-shirt because in the open

00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,370
source world t-shirts are kind of like

00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,970
currency and they make the world go

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:06,300
round around but if i look back up of

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:08,900
the whole idea in just 48 hours I felt

00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,880
like I belong if I have found my place I

00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,920
started all this open-source thing for

00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,650
all the wrong reasons for a t-shirt for

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,390
material gains but I got there and I

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,580
found a vibrant community which kind

00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,520
embraced me maybe feel like I belong and

00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,840
they stayed for all the right reasons

00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,760
for for the Muslim community which a

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,510
bunch of us are here in the room if you

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,640
see this they should just say hi and in

00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,830
the end I'm not I'm not really looking

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,960
back it's like

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:41,280
I just found the missing piece of my

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,140
puzzle at I'm here for four basically

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,150
Mozilla and they got into it for a lousy

00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,280
t-shirt which I don't own any more

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:50,270
because you know a t-shirt doesn't you

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,360
know last 25 years but the sense of

00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:56,070
being part of a community that's that's

00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,550
what it's all about folks and with that

00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,550
