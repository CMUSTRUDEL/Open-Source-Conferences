okay so here we are among this group of

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,930
illustrious young people and the first

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,809
question I had to ask myself am I the

00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,360
oldest person in the room anyone older

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,890
than 52 here I already know that Lucas

00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,140
comes closer are you older than 50 to

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,850
you son of a you took the victory

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,199
away from me I wanted to be the oldest

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,789
person in the room and I wanted to be

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,400
the oldest person in the room to tell

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,410
you a story that is important the first

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,910
thing is after listening to all the

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,559
people here tonight starting with

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,420
Stephanie and Gerard and then going to

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,129
angeline and then listening to Mandy and

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,280
then listening to arena and then bashed

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,900
it and then Tiffany and then Alex and

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,870
then starting the new sequence with

00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:48,659
Chris and Lucas and then coming down to

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:52,440
the question of Amy and then the

00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:55,680
questions that Ford went forth with boss

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,449
and l / and then finally Peter and then

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,659
me do you know where your food comes

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:02,879
from can you make or grow your own the

00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:05,040
question is incredibly important to life

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,840
but all the people that preceded me and

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,670
talking tonight we're talking about

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,770
things like community they were talking

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,350
about where our food comes from in a

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,909
very subtle and strange way because

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,799
we're all looking for sophistication

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,149
we're all looking for the things that

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,619
important don't look at my slides

00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:20,820
anymore because they're not important or

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,439
what I want to speak about because they

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,030
didn't prepare this in a way that's

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,590
relevant to the top I wanted to touch

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,320
all of you in a way that's important

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,759
because I don't create talks inside of

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,740
me I listened to it and I think about

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,689
the people so here i am in berlin and

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,429
i'm listening to a bunch of people who

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,590
are interested in sophistication and

00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:39,689
building community in building and

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,979
miring diversity and building something

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,270
wonderful the world and the first

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,609
question that comes to me is how

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,100
relevant is your tactile experience of

00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:48,929
life I'm 52 years old we got one bugger

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,850
who's older than me and when I was a

00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:52,560
young guy we used to go in the fields

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,969
and we used to chase bugs now I admire

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,159
the fact that you're creating these

00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:58,289
amazing things with computers and

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,840
digital ization but we have to have a

00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:02,100
nexus remember this is all about systems

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,740
and it's about things that we have

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,240
developed in our own creative mind but

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,539
what is the interrelationship with

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,670
nature you are on nature in the Catholic

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,410
Church there's ash wednesday and you go

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,760
back to ashes if any of you can prove

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,769
that you don't go back to ashes when

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,490
you're dead you'll be proven to not

00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,950
listen

00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,620
but because you are am nature the Nexus

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:25,440
has to come from us and redevelop what

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,240
we are as a community as a society as a

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,190
world something that's so

00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,990
extraordinarily important that if we

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,670
don't get a hold it now we're going to

00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,760
lose out on everything and the basis of

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:37,620
this is curiosity I tell people over and

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,750
over again the basis of changing the

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,690
world is curiosity when Angelina talked

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,430
about cognition in her talk when we

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,710
listen to chris talk about the idea of

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,810
games we can live in a natural game a

00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,580
real world God and look in the fields

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,380
I'm a natural botanist I travel all over

00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,760
the world I look at plans it's not so

00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,460
relevant to what I want to teach you

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,920
tonight because my experience is to open

00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,530
up a huge amazing world and it's real

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,940
you don't have to create thousands and

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,010
thousands of years of history where

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,780
humans of interrelated with nature you

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,220
have to be able to experience it you're

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,320
missing out you're playing games

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,930
wonderful you're creating this

00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,520
phantasmal world but you are made of

00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,110
flesh and blood and I can prove it

00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,310
because if I come and punch anyone if

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,250
you're going to scream or your punch me

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,690
back you're tactically deprived there's

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,820
an expression in the United States it

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,610
came about a book of young people call

00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,500
nature deficit disorder the synonym or

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,780
the acronym for the disorder because

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,430
young people don't go in nature anymore

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,770
they're afraid of it what about the bugs

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,270
I mean I know my girlfriend she doesn't

00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,340
do anything she wears high heels she's

00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:40,170
afraid of every insect in the world yeah

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,360
I run around the world looking for these

00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,610
things the vast diversity the complex

00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,200
relationships between humans and people

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,020
that have gone on for hundreds of

00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,000
thousands of years 25,000 years ago

00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,010
people are living in almost every part

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,740
of the planet and they were surviving

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,840
and now we hear companies like Monsanto

00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,850
telling us things that we aren't going

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,470
to be able to feed a hungry world with

00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,990
nine billion people because we have to

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,300
genetically modify organisms to be able

00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:08,310
to feed them and why this is relevant is

00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,640
number one you don't know the difference

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:13,800
not to say that you're not intelligent

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,750
intellectual curious but the story is so

00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,400
detached from your reality that you can

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,260
listen that the only way we're gonna

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,000
feed a hungry world is through making

00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,770
corn more resilient to drought to make

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,140
rice more productive or more higher in

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,090
vitamin content and the reality as we

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,310
have forgot about the diversity of

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,760
nature I spent 30 years traveling around

00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,970
the

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,640
planet eating food all over this is in

00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:38,220
the kalahari desert in namibia Vanara

00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:41,640
melon growing invest desert sands and

00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:44,280
yet it has fed the people who have eaten

00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,740
it for thousands of years the story is

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,050
reconnect with nature build communities

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,660
find the nexus between the brilliance of

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,810
your minds that digital world that

00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,370
you've created that so magical is

00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,710
replicated a billion times in nature

00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,260
even something so mundane and boring a

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:04,020
soil happens to be an extraordinary

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:07,680
community a game better than any digital

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,870
fabrication not to discredit your genius

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,210
but apply it in a way that reconnects

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,400
with nature this is why the story of the

00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,590
world is not being told i wanted to tell

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,090
about the real story of food but i

00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,040
realize after listening to the people

00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,110
here there was more relevant to give you

00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,140
this message did it come you get it

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:27,030
diversity curiosity connecting building

00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,710
a new nexus of systems we can do

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,780
something extraordinary because all of

00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:34,160
those together make for an incredible

00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,160
