okay my name is Tiffany and I'm here to

00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,990
talk about workplace confidence so

00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,240
people have told me that they admire my

00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,340
confidence and that makes me privileged

00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:23,509
because having confidence in the

00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:25,119
workplace matters confident people have

00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:27,769
greater access to help and information

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,929
they're not afraid to ask for help when

00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:32,240
needed and when they do ask for help

00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:36,160
confident workers expect to understand

00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,160
the explanation that's been provided

00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:41,690
confident people have the freedom to be

00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,670
honest they readily admit mistakes

00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,800
because they don't worry about looking

00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,330
bad when they're wrong by admitting

00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,220
mistakes they can learn from them and

00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,220
they can move past those mistakes

00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,810
confident people make themselves heard

00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,790
and understood they know their ideas are

00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:01,520
worthwhile so they speak to colleagues

00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,530
at a calm relaxed pace if someone does

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,000
not understand them they react splain

00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:10,400
until they are understood confident

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,640
people have influence and the effect

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,740
change when their ideas are challenged

00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,080
confident people assert their points of

00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:23,900
view and ultimately they change the

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:26,330
minds of others confident people ensure

00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,159
they get commensurate compensation they

00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,560
recognize the tremendous value they

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,000
bring this does not mean that having

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,490
confidence means you deserve better

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,930
compensation just confident people know

00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:40,970
their own value you can get the benefits

00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:43,130
of having confidence even if you have

00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,440
self-doubt there are tactics you can use

00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:48,170
to combat and compensate for yourself

00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:52,970
doubt to get the same benefits as having

00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:54,530
confidence here are some of them you can

00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:57,020
get access to help and information by

00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,640
reminding yourself that learning is part

00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,190
of your work and that other people are

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,080
obligated to help you remind yourself

00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,270
that you possess knowledge and skills

00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,239
that others want focus on increasing

00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,799
your own expertise you can have the

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,420
freedom to be honest by reminding

00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:14,330
yourself that admitting mistakes earns

00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,279
you respect and trust people will learn

00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,599
they can rely on you and they will

00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:19,599
respect you for your honesty

00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:27,769
you can be heard and understood by

00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:31,159
speaking louder and slower in fat in

00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:34,280
short fake confidence emulate the

00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:38,690
delivery of a confident person this can

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,160
be learned you can have influence and

00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,599
effect change by gathering and

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,760
presenting the evidence you need to

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,860
support your views as you're building up

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:53,390
a reputation you will need the evidence

00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:55,579
to back up the things you say lose your

00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:58,010
fear of being wrong by being open about

00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:59,840
what you are uncertain about you may

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,400
lack confidence because you know you are

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,709
missing a few details to give you a

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,640
feeling of certainty but not knowing

00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:09,379
something is not a personal weakness you

00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,390
can get commensurate compensation by

00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:14,090
knowing the value of your contribution

00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,980
list out with the company would lose if

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,440
no one was providing the contribution

00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:23,060
you bring you can also ask your manager

00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:24,859
to help you make such a list learn how

00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,019
to say I don't feel I'm being

00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:29,660
compensated for the contribution i make

00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:32,660
leave companies that don't value your

00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:38,389
work doing valuable work is not a

00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:40,280
personal favor so people have asked me

00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:42,349
how to become more confident and I have

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,599
no idea how to become more confident I

00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:46,819
gained my confidence from people giving

00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,829
me confidence what I can tell you our

00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:52,510
ways to build up confidence in other

00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:52,510
people and give them these benefits

00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,079
thank people for their help and tell

00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,660
them when their help was valuable be

00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:02,060
open and non-judgmental when people ask

00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:06,160
you for help seek out the expert

00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,160
opinions of people who are junior to you

00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,180
listen when quiet people are speaking

00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:14,030
and make sure you understand their ideas

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:16,430
and views invite silent people to

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:20,859
contribute use your ability to command

00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,859
attention to direct it at other people

00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,120
thank people who admit mistakes and

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,820
elaborate on what the benefits of that

00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,620
admission were to tell people what

00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,830
evidence they could gather to convince

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,280
you explain to people what about their

00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:39,830
argument

00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:42,380
convinced you tell people what you value

00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:44,270
about their contributions tell their

00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,280
manager what you value about their

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,010
contributions and if it's in your power

00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:53,810
pay people fairly for their valuable

00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:55,970
contributions having confidence in the

00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,980
workplace matters and there are tactics

00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,750
for overcoming self-doubt but I also

00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,610
hope what you take away is that you can

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,040
build up confidence in other people to

00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:07,900
both be a decent person and also bring

00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,900
