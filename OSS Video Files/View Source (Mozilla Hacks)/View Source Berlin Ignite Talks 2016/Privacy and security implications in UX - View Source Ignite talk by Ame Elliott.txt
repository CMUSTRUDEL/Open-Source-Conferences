hi everyone I'm Amy despite my pix

00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:15,950
elated image i welcome you to photograph

00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,509
me tweet at me there's a lot of stuff to

00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,430
get through in this five minutes so

00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:22,910
please reach out if you still have

00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:25,939
questions I live in Berlin I work simply

00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,980
secure we're a nonprofit that does open

00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:31,250
research and consulting focused on

00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,170
security privacy and ethics I'm a UX

00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,899
designer but we also work with

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:38,720
developers now you don't have to be a

00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:41,450
hard core developer or cryptographer all

00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,329
certificates anyone didn't fix it to

00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:46,100
work in security there are wonderful UX

00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:48,920
problems that everyone can make a

00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,380
contribution to as a user a researcher a

00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,110
front-end developer and when we talk

00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,180
about UX design here I want to be clear

00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,670
I mean the whole spectrum of user

00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:01,820
experience even some areas you might not

00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:04,399
be thinking of the copy in your website

00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:07,280
is a way to protect privacy your App

00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:09,890
Store description also this is an app

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,560
store example from a dunkin donuts the

00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,389
woman their uses DD perks you see it

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,729
over her shoulder it gives you a

00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:19,579
discount on coffee and donuts in

00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:22,340
exchange for something much heavier the

00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:25,069
app asks for all of the contacts in your

00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,560
address book your location the ability

00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:31,549
to delete media off of your phone and

00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,979
much more and the UX doesn't convey what

00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:37,609
that trade-off is and we as a community

00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:39,380
can do better so I have three things I

00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:42,619
want you to take away and i'll start

00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:46,219
with don't leak data super pragmatic if

00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:48,829
you have a product with a login you also

00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:51,829
have a password recovery flow make sure

00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:54,920
those don't clue others in too if

00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:56,990
someone is a user or not Ashley Madison

00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,749
famous for being hacked they were

00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,579
already leaking data if you enter in an

00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:03,979
email address and say I forgot my

00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:06,859
password you either get great we sent it

00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:10,970
or sorry why don't you sign up don't do

00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:14,180
that don't leak data be consistent next

00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:16,599
up consider who is reading along this

00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,040
next example comes from enterprise

00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:22,069
communication tool slack

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,200
super excited about slack but chat BOTS

00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:27,469
have some interesting implications for

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,870
who else reads there's a chat bot called

00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:32,090
slack bot that responds to your messages

00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,340
with something humorous or helpful but

00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,680
look at this at the bottom they choose

00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,579
not to respond in one-to-one direct

00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,349
messages it creates an illusion an

00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:44,629
illusion of privacy because of course

00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:46,760
slack bot is reading of course slack has

00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:50,629
all this stuff it's a proprietary

00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:53,269
platform another example is if you

00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:55,549
consider icelandair lets you buy tickets

00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:58,609
in facebook Messenger through their bot

00:02:55,549 --> 00:03:00,889
who else is reading obviously icelandair

00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:02,480
you expect but Facebook governments

00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:06,019
you're entering your passport your

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,900
banking details what can the UX do to

00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:11,419
make those systems clear now this is not

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,760
new we chat and China has been doing

00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:15,680
this for a while dan Grover's a designer

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,840
that talks a lot about this I don't read

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,069
Chinese but we can learn here what do

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,319
you expose and what do you conceal this

00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:26,750
third point is about meaningful symbols

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,500
and I'm going to speak about checkmarks

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:33,199
and about locks so talking about locks

00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,769
it's the icon of security but it's not

00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:39,049
always meaningful I'm a designer I can

00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:42,379
make an image with two states unlocked

00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:44,269
open and then click secure but that can

00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:46,790
be fake and not hooked up to anything

00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:50,299
what do these locks mean who knows what

00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:52,549
are some better examples of that well

00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:54,620
one thing is in the iOS messaging

00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:56,930
platform you get little hints of

00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,449
information like read receipts Green

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,729
bubble means not an iOS partner Blue

00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:03,979
means an iOS messaging partner you see

00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:05,720
the words delivered in red or in the

00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:08,569
right hand side the check marks and

00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,510
whatsapp that's a first attempt in the

00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:13,699
browser Firefox does this chrome is also

00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:16,669
starting to experiment with in the URL

00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:19,579
bar having a lock or an eye creating an

00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:23,000
idea that an HTTP connection is not as

00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:26,870
good as an HTTPS those are you x

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,289
problems so don't leak data consider who

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,280
reads what and use meaningful symbols to

00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:33,590
try to build a

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,200
unity of people protecting privacy for

00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:38,050
others and I'll be here for the next

00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,120
couple days I welcome your feedback

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,639
simply secure has a public slack channel

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,080
email for an introduction and I thank

00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:47,080
