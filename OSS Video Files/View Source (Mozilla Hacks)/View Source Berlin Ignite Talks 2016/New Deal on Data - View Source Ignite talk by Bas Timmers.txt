I would like to start off with

00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:13,850
comforting you if it starts it does

00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:16,600
because this speech is not at least not

00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:19,910
only about money what it is about is

00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,580
creating a new fair and better world of

00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:27,560
data for everyone civilians and firms

00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:29,180
alike this is Meg Liana kun ova she was

00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,640
a European Commissioner a couple of

00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:34,399
years ago and she said data is the oil

00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:38,800
of the 21st century so if this is true

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,800
why aren't we all feel fully rich yet

00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:44,449
the next to you guys have something to

00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:47,449
do with that the Zack Larry Page and

00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:50,269
their company's Facebook Apple and other

00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:52,579
companies as well Google Amazon they've

00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:54,499
been building a world of digital silos

00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:58,460
they've been building digital Islands

00:00:54,499 --> 00:01:00,890
empires for their own based on our data

00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,530
and it's not only private firms that

00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,990
have been doing that it's public sector

00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:09,050
as well so governments have been storing

00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:11,689
our text data traffic data heating

00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:14,869
electricity waste disposal stuff like

00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:17,090
that so where does it lead you for

00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:19,820
things first one monopolies this is the

00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,710
Gang of Four the Daltons Joe avril and

00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,229
the other two that they also forget in

00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:31,009
the modern world it's Amazon Facebook

00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:33,380
Google and Amazon I guess so they've

00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:36,159
been creating monopolies but also there

00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,659
is an unequal distribution of wealth

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:44,539
they've been building the oil refineries

00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:46,700
of the modern-day age but we supply the

00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:50,539
oil we should be getting compensated for

00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:53,000
that it's not only about private firms

00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:55,429
it's also about sharing data which will

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,840
yields results what can we do with

00:01:55,429 --> 00:02:02,119
sharing data we could for instance trace

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,920
traffic patterns we could use data to

00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:09,020
see which medication is working or not

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:11,390
we could make we could make forecasts of

00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:15,140
where there will be an epidemic or not

00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:16,849
and the most important thing is that we

00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,460
have lost control of our data so there's

00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:21,710
nothing new actually sandy Pentland

00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:26,630
coins the term new deal on data already

00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:29,240
in 2007 in an essay and he made a couple

00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:32,240
of principles you can read them yourself

00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,610
but what is is about basically is that

00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,970
we should be having a Swiss bank account

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:39,650
for our data we are determining what's

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:43,370
happening with our data who has access

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:45,710
to it and where we store it that's it

00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:47,960
the fourth principle that he added is

00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:49,850
that this new deal on data should be

00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,080
promoting the sharing of big data for

00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,360
the use of the common good so the

00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,060
examples that I gave just previous with

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,630
medication and epidemics and stuff like

00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,760
that that's a really good start but I

00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:04,760
would like to extend it a bit because my

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,680
search data should be mine as well so I

00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,590
could hand it over to not only google

00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,970
but also to dr. go or to Bing so they

00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,480
would have the opportunity to provide

00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:16,940
the same services google does same goes

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,190
for my shopping data so if i'm searching

00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:22,280
on amazon i would like to have zalando

00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:24,710
have the same data so they can also give

00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,780
the same level of service so we would

00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:30,470
create kind of an even playing field and

00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,450
more competition I said it's not only

00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,510
about the private sector firms but it's

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:42,920
also about the government who are

00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:45,170
storing a lot of data of us so that's

00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,180
why I came up with this framework to

00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,220
make it a bit more complete the free

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,770
players are over their firms civilians

00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,830
and and the authorities and there are

00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:56,080
three levels of storing your data

00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:59,060
default is that we share everything

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,750
there's only a limited amount of data

00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:05,090
that keeps private from firms of origin

00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,560
civilians we can share a lot anonymous

00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,360
for instance I would share my health

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,330
data with universities for research

00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,760
purposes and it would only I would share

00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:16,190
my medical data completely with my

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,590
general practitioner and this new data

00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:21,530
framework would achieve the aims that

00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:23,870
are listed up here you can read them for

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:27,320
yourself and that's what I wanted to

00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:30,169
talk about with you today I know it's a

00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,360
very abstract subject we didn't make a

00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,380
lot of progress since 2007 but there are

00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,290
a couple of things that

00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:39,560
can do visit free or data torque which

00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:41,900
tries to achieve change in a European

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,560
contact I wrote an essay at noyes

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,600
acknowledged de / new deal for people

00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,670
who are interested in learning shitloads

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,680
of money and redistributing wealth I can

00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:56,000
highly recommend the book who owns the

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:59,210
future by jaron lanier and I would like

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,040
to ask you at the end think about what

00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,440
kind of digital life you want to leave

00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,530
in the next couple of years and now grab

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,890
your smartphones and share your photos

00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,570
and your thoughts about this speech and

00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:14,830
enjoy the rest of the conference have a

00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,830
