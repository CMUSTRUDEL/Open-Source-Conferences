hello everybody thanks for having me

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,379
here I feel a bit displaced I'm a silly

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:19,919
designer that's all I can do and I i

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,919
draw world maps these kind of maps I

00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:25,769
make and I want to tell you something

00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:27,119
about it like if you if you close your

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,640
eyes if you don't close your eyes but if

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,349
you think about the portray of the world

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,900
which is a map of the world basically is

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,489
we all tend to think about the same

00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,010
stuff that's why I don't have the image

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:41,760
justjust project the world that you have

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,500
in your head in front of you in ninety

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,120
five percent it's the same kind of

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,120
imagery rules which will show up later

00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:51,750
because so it's either if you live in in

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,000
in this part of the world you have

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,750
something like that and if you live in

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,309
Asia you will have something like that

00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,530
but if you look into this this is stock

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,449
it's a stock image of the world it's

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,990
actually a sort of a born idea of the

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:08,729
world because there's no poles and if

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,410
you cut through the baring street from

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,750
Russia America which effect is a

00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:15,240
political line you cannot cut through

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,790
water so the water there you will always

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,490
cut land so it's a sort of imaginary

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,860
image in fact we we sort of fumble

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,840
around with the with the world until we

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,460
get what we want and that is having

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,630
those countries that we find important

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,640
tour are politically imported or

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:34,650
historically important in a sensor just

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,000
like with painting so I make of course

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,670
there were different maps of the world

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,320
and and this is a great attempt of the

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,930
pedis projection which was pushed by

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,780
UNICEF in the 70s it was in my classroom

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:49,520
when I was kid showing true surface so

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:52,079
this is a true service map and this is a

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,479
attempt from the fantastic architect

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,219
Buckminster Fuller who makes a

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,380
discontinuous projection and somehow

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,860
discontinued protections we don't like

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,869
that we want to have one straight image

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,939
although this here you could reshuffle

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:07,439
them as well well this is a map I made

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,329
which actually actually is based on

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,489
macarthur projection the thing you have

00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:13,980
in your head and it shows here how

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,840
intensely the distortion comes in the

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,669
north and in the south or here in the up

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,669
and down so this is Madagascar here

00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:22,140
getting very big this is an interrupted

00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:23,640
austell projection

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,330
about the words I made these as as

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:30,360
lithography so as Prince in a way and

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:34,319
this is more about graduated cool so the

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:38,910
the the the the game of parallels and

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:41,340
meridians this is a in most map so here

00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,980
you see the the pols coming more into

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,510
the image like and that's a bit of a

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,700
political theme of course because we

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,560
don't project the pools so you know why

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,650
do we care if the polls would be

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,750
inhabited we would have imagery more

00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,670
like this not like the kind of imagery

00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,390
as I showed at the start because we

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,519
couldn't we wouldn't accept you know an

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,290
area not to be on the dismayed by a

00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,780
pentwater by a hacked pen plotter

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:09,480
actually these are three images of the

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,450
world where is surrounded by one world

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,760
so left the golden thing around this

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,800
China in the middle it's Germany and in

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,230
the inner on the right side it's America

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,959
so it's a projection onto a cone in a

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:24,090
way and turn it upside down these are

00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,880
some things that I mostly draw by hand

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,980
and helped here it's helped by by a pen

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,110
plotter and the pen starts leaking Wendy

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:37,500
when the coastline is more complex like

00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:39,090
in like in Canada same thing this is

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,010
made with the heck pen plotter as well

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,720
and you see they're here in South

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:46,079
America the coastlines very complex that

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,900
the pen starts leaking and yeah I kind

00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:51,180
of liked it sometimes I ask myself why

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,530
do I do this oh yeah well wait one

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,709
second before answer this question this

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,780
is these are sitting so we tend another

00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,940
thing that I that I dislike is that we

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,190
have this hierarchy between important

00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,680
cities and non important cities or non

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:07,410
important places so this is if you

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,480
project these are all lost the titles

00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:12,660
was not true but these are unimportant

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,579
cities with the K because I thought yes

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,130
just pick one okay let's not try to

00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:19,560
decide whether because there's there's

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,539
an error on every city the or every map

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,280
there is New York will always be on but

00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:24,720
there will be many cities in India which

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,130
are bigger than their new york that are

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,680
not on the map so there is a definite

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:31,229
hierarchy in what you project on a map

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,530
and in fact these dogmas of cartography

00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,910
I try to turn around and and and show

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,060
that there is more imagery

00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,650
of the world possible here Australia is

00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,080
on the left side there's one thing I

00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:45,030
always make correct maps so you can sail

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,130
you can fly whatever these maps are all

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,530
correct I don't go into Photoshop and

00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:52,110
steer these are all projection methods I

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,700
is a complex amount of notes this is a

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,740
map where the Netherlands where I come

00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,290
from on the left is as big as it can get

00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:01,020
in any projection in any turn and any

00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:03,650
 around but it's still a correct net

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,650
