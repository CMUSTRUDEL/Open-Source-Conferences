good evening everyone

00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:13,640
and thank you for being here and being

00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:16,520
part of this dynamic community of ignite

00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,550
Berlin and it is on top of my impromptu

00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,869
speeches I didn't know about it till

00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:26,300
11pm last night so yes be gentle on me

00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:28,369
we're going to talk about the

00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,200
avant-garde of the culinary world when I

00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:32,329
think about ignite I think about two

00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,520
things ignite a fire and ignite a

00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:36,710
passion and those are the two things

00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:40,400
that shape most of our lives including

00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:44,110
our cuisine our kitchens our lives so I

00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,850
want you to think about what constitutes

00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:49,100
innovation I want you to think about

00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:51,500
traditions as a dynamic concept and I

00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,330
want you to think about that why do we

00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,640
need a revolution and mostly an

00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,440
evolution in our food system it's

00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,050
because we have 800 million people

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,870
hungry it's because we have a great rate

00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:05,239
of obesity and it's because we use 15

00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,460
plants only for ninety percent of our

00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,860
caloric intake so do we need an oven

00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,080
guard yes we do and these are some of

00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:15,140
the people that are on the lead of that

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,039
movement Carlo Petrini the founder of

00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:21,890
slow foods Ferran Adria the guy who

00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:23,479
started el bulli Rene Redzepi the best

00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,310
restaurant in the world and a few others

00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:27,140
that I'll speak about individually this

00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,960
is me and Carlo Petrini at an event

00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,450
called slow foods why slow foods were

00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,909
used to hear about globalization and

00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,890
fast movement and fast transformation

00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:39,889
but there's also a great opposition to

00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:42,380
uniform ization so slow foods is a

00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:44,840
rejection of that and a return to your

00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:47,329
traditions this is an image from their

00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,600
event two years ago in Torino Italy

00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:52,909
where they had over 250,000 people in

00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,039
attendance and they had people from over

00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:58,579
100 countries if you think of something

00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:00,469
as wide as North America we know that

00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:03,799
Native American Indians consume about

00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:06,049
3,000 plans and if you ask today people

00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:09,229
could name maybe one two three of those

00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:12,860
these are completely unexplored chances

00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:15,290
and then we think about lost traditions

00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,970
and ancient foods and super foods and

00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,849
where do we get all those while we get

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,380
it from interacting among us is cultures

00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:24,270
this is a key Noah

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,940
and it's one of those examples where

00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:29,670
forgotten food came back to prominence I

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,190
promised I would talk about the food

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,560
heroes reading this revolution and you

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,540
have here Ferran Adria I don't know how

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,720
many of you are familiar with him but he

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,880
started the molecular cuisine he also

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,940
influenced a lot of other people like

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:48,500
Rene Redzepi the number one chef in the

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:51,540
world who has a restaurant in Denmark

00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:54,870
strange place for food innovation but he

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:57,240
created a menu based on Scandinavian

00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,190
foods alone and this is another person

00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,890
who might inspire you if you think about

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:04,170
it he is Jose Andres and he's

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,180
responsible for bringing tapas or small

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:09,300
portions into the u.s. now if that's not

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,910
revolutionary he's also the guy leading

00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,580
food diplomacy along with the State

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:16,920
Department in a program meant to bring

00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,710
people together and realize how

00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,560
important food is to all of us as a tool

00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:27,630
that transcends preconceptions and it

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:31,650
transcends boundaries of all sort this

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:34,170
here is Robin and he is the winner of

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,500
the Dutch innovation prize for three

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:39,810
years in sequence he is the person who

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,360
sells those wonderful ingredients to the

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,730
chefs now this is one of the things that

00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,760
we find most extraordinary in his

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:50,280
collection it's called oyster leaf and

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,530
it tastes exactly like an oyster imagine

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,800
a plant that tastes like a meat and

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,170
think about how much we can expand our

00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:01,020
understanding of the food world this is

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:04,110
another hero farmer Lee Jones in Ohio

00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:07,080
his activity is similar to rob ants he

00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:10,350
brings chefs together and he tries to

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:13,410
let every one of them experiment with

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:15,570
their own niche here are two Native

00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:18,930
American chefs Sean Sherman being one of

00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:21,480
them and he's becoming very very popular

00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,040
for using some of those forgotten three

00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,770
thousand plants that I was mentioning

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,240
about one of the images that was on the

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,390
screen earlier looked like a mushroom

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,370
and it's called Feliz masanori it's a

00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:35,550
plan that taste like pizza thinking of

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,319
taste sensations here and this is gerard

00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,370
craft

00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:42,150
innovation happens in unlikely places

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:45,419
that was in Missouri this is a

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:47,849
restaurant in Austria in Vienna and it's

00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,020
number ninth in the world right now one

00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:51,419
of the things that I was most impressed

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,210
with is that they went back to the

00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:55,919
concept of food identity and that's

00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,240
really important before serving you

00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,150
every dish they would give you a little

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,880
card with the name of the ingredients

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,289
and which farm produced them now we need

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,110
to go back to that and we need to

00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:10,229
rethink so if all of this is really

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:15,180
tradition and retracing old foods is

00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:17,699
really innovation well yes it is yes

00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,500
we're not losing our traditions and

00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,940
we're not losing our history but it is

00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,180
innovation in the sense that we are

00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,949
using modern communication and we're

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,430
using those communities that we just

00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:32,210
heard about to expand our views on food

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,210
