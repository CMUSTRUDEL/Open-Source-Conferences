hi so I want to start off by asking what

00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:15,380
is community and what is it capable of

00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,390
there's so much nuance in that one word

00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,580
it doesn't quite really capture the

00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,010
scope of communities that can exist from

00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,900
families to co-workers to local

00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,669
religious groups nor does it quite

00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,349
capture the transformative power of

00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:29,750
communities to transform the lives of

00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:32,689
the individuals within them so how do

00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,640
you even begin to define that I want to

00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,470
share a story where I try to do so and

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,699
the following slides will just be

00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:43,550
pictures of of of that journey so in

00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:45,500
2014 I had just finished high school and

00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,809
not wanting to take gap not wanting to

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,910
take university right away I decided to

00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:51,739
take a gap year so I joined a group of

00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:55,399
nine people in an experimental

00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:58,370
fellowship called the go project we went

00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,410
to Turkey Myanmar and Panama for a year

00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,149
total working as in as in house

00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,820
consultants for various organizations

00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:07,310
this was my first job and I didn't

00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,440
really know what I was doing it was a

00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,850
strange circumstance and to be in after

00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,200
high school but nothing could have

00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,960
prepared me for the growth that followed

00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,600
so this is where we stayed in Myanmar

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,670
it's a super charming place I know there

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,680
was no kitchen the electricity and water

00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,580
would go out like all the time and it

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,890
was also very tough being together 24 7

00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:29,300
imagine going to work with your

00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,650
co-workers every morning and then

00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,690
returning home in the evenings together

00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,520
to cook to have dinner to just be

00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:38,210
together all the time you get to know

00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,740
each other very very fast but even that

00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:44,180
and the challenge is beyond all of it

00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:45,950
was a learning opportunity and I clearly

00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:48,380
remember the first day that I arrived

00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,970
Istanbul Turkey I was supposed to meet

00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:54,080
my team for the first time and I was

00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:56,240
scared out of my mind again I had no

00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,130
prior experience they were all a lot

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,320
older than I was and when they saw me

00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,150
standing there at the entrance stiffly

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,300
and unsure of myself they came up to me

00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:07,280
one by one and greeted me with hugs that

00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,129
was such a small gesture but for me and

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,440
meant so much and because they extended

00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:14,540
that openness to me it let me kind of

00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,820
relax and reciprocate that inform and

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:19,620
that was actually the first lesson that

00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,390
they taught me is that people reflect

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,090
how you make them feel and I don't think

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,909
I've ever stopped learning since so from

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,890
that day we had three yeah three months

00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:31,319
to organize the first demo day of

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,580
startup bootcamp Istanbul we all came in

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,190
with our respective skill sets that

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,989
combined allowed us to pull it off and

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,209
we pull it off in all of the places we

00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:41,250
went to from pushing projects that had

00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:44,159
to do with increasing education access

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,769
in Myanmar or creating local communities

00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,269
in Panama City all of it was possible

00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:50,340
because of the support we had for each

00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:52,739
other and the support that the local

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,769
communities provided for us this year

00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:57,680
long experiment changes us into people

00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:59,790
who not only had the capacity to create

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,900
diverse change but people who actually

00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:06,450
did and I think that transformation kind

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,609
of crept up on us and it wasn't in our

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,069
onboarding documents or a documented

00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:13,650
scope of work it was in everything else

00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:15,930
it was in the late night collaborations

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,280
before a deadline it was in the intense

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,920
warmth of all the communities that

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,680
welcomed us wherever we went it was in

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,660
the super spontaneous trips to the end

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,489
of bus lines or two temples at sunrise

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,530
it was in all the difficult

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,480
conversations that were between people

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,269
who were friends or co-workers were

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,620
family like all the lines blurred and it

00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:37,139
was in the vulnerability that we all

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,239
gave each other and consequently the

00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:43,650
trust that we built occasionally broke

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:46,019
but ultimately were built again and the

00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,269
entire scope of our experiences the good

00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,530
and the bad and the in between all of it

00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:53,780
was learning and it was something that

00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:56,280
none of us could have had alone and

00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,260
while I understand this story is a

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,599
pretty extreme case of what a

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,269
transformative community could look like

00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,230
I do believe there are some

00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:06,959
generalizable principles that can be

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:09,000
extracted from them for example the

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,639
importance of friendship individual

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,269
well-being as collective well-being the

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:17,549
value of diverse shared experiences

00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:20,459
designing change as a way to learn as a

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:24,030
communal way to learn I think those

00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,960
things are very important and figuring

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,699
out how to make the most of the

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,090
communities you're in it doesn't have to

00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:32,310
be a formal process either extending

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,880
yourself fully and sharing who you are

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,820
and

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,290
sense actively practicing the values of

00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,970
the communities you want to see yourself

00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,880
in is something that anyone can do at

00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:44,160
any time for example there are a lot of

00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,320
people at this conference so why not

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,240
keep it in the back of your mind the

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,860
next time you talk to someone the

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,450
potential that you can create something

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,480
that lasts a lot longer than the

00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:56,460
lifespan of a business card and so

00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,830
finally I leave you with the question

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:03,260
what are your communities and what

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,260
