	00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:11,549
so conferences like this remind me of

00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,799
why it's important to ask ourselves what

00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:15,690
does it mean to be educated some of us

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,910
went to schools with classrooms that use

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,039
a traditional model where the teacher

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,440
sat in front of the classroom most

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,710
likely at the tables and rows with

00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:31,189
yellowing notes and you know talking to

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:38,609
each other and next slide please

00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:40,499
and most likely they yeah they also you

00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:44,399
know repeated their collisions every

00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:49,920
year after year after year after year

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:51,899
like imparting knowledge in one

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,719
direction and requiring students to

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,179
regurgitate facts this was seen as a

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,559
good education raise your hand if you're

00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:02,969
sat in classrooms like this at some

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:06,320
point yeah listen to this learn this

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:11,039
take this test and do it like this

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,560
regurgitate the facts yeah

00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:16,890
this model is changing currently some

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,920
trends include stem programs or focusing

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,109
on the arts as much as math yeah so then

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,000
it turns into steam creativity

00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:28,799
inclusivity bilingualism multilingualism

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,350
IT integration design integration

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,210
smaller class sizes multi age groups

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,350
classrooms without walls classrooms and

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,649
forests differentiated learning

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:40,579
project-based learning I could go on and

00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:42,929
what do we end up with we end up with

00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:45,329
frustrated teachers that are overwhelmed

00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:48,270
teaching trends come teaching trends go

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:52,020
and at some point someone whether it be

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,549
at a national domestic private public

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,060
school someone's making a decision about

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:59,070
what it means to be educated in an

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,319
increasing global world educators have

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,659
rapidly changing complex challenges in

00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,759
Berlin conversations include how we're

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,920
going to be inclusive you know look with

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,619
kids with learning difficulties and it

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,040
increasingly international global mobile

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,900
families so we have to ask yourselves

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,300
what is important to know whose history

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,780
do we teach if we just teach to the

00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,240
facts

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,380
that is a vast plane of knowledge it's

00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,020
impossible to cover

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,780
it's an overcrowded curriculum not to

00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,100
mention that facts at your fingertips

00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,620
however when you have a good concept

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,569
that sticks around and even if it

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,150
improves and morphs and it becomes a

00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:37,800
more sophisticated version of itself but

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,010
for example the concept of the internet

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,870
or the wheel now and this is why I think

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,000
teaching two concepts is important

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,239
because concepts transfer over time

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,160
cultures and situations yeah it's the

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,470
knowledge that requires application in

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,120
different contexts whilst preparing to

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:57,209
speak here I looked at an ICT curriculum

00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,120
from the past it was published by UNESCO

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:02,250
in 2002 and it said using the computer

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,500
and managing files it said students

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,050
should be able to use a competent

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:12,060
computer competently produce posters and

00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:13,980
banners and other such things nearly 15

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,989
years later and school kids are coding

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,459
they're learning about robotics and

00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:19,680
they're seamlessly using touch screens

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,630
my two-year-old wants to swipe our TV

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,299
and my seven-year-old hacked his pal

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,150
password for his device so if a

00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:29,100
curriculum is worth knowing it needs to

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,959
keep up with the times when learning

00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,810
goals need to be concept based because

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,910
concepts are timeless we need to engage

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,920
learners and different types of thinking

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,380
to prepare them for a changing job

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,049
market and increasingly global complex

00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:45,810
global issues thinking conceptually is

00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:47,430
not easy it's hard work and because we

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,560
need to connect between the facts and

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,140
the big ideas this raises our intellect

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,000
as kids move through schooling emphasis

00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,180
is on the facts conceptual thinking

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,549
takes a downturn this creates what the

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:03,510
Swiss German educator Peter Fratton

00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:06,060
calls this ins reason and reality rooms

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,100
vagon knowledge Giants and inflammation

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,750
Dwarfs

00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,109
do we need more trivia winners or

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,060
critical thinkers who would you hire

00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:18,120
even in project-based schools topic

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,239
trivia based units such as this grade

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,039
one topic on animals can be fun teachers

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,590
plan projects they teach through inquiry

00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:29,210
based practices that's good but good

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:32,070
isn't good enough I want great and

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,689
teaching too even though it's hard to do

00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,939
this

00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:37,159
because we need thinking teachers as

00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:38,569
well as thinking students if we add the

00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:41,149
concept of classification and

00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:43,509
characteristics to the animal topic then

00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:45,860
this units now going to focus on

00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:47,659
classification so we can study the

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,779
classification classification of colors

00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:53,179
of instruments of actual animals in

00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:55,489
science and we're teaching to conceptual

00:04:53,179 --> 00:04:58,879
understanding understanding that will

00:04:55,489 --> 00:05:01,759
hopefully transfer conceptual engagement

00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:04,639
goes up factual knowledge also is

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,439
learned yeah and I hope that they will

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,419
then transfer it and come home maybe my

00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:11,110
son will classify clothing from our

00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:13,789
wardrobe one can only hope

00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,550
learning looks more like this when

00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:18,709
thinking students we create thinking

00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:21,110
leaders of tomorrow even though such a

00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:22,699
de curriculum is difficult it's

00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,379
happening around the globe and in

00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:27,319
international schools here in Berlin

00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:28,579
also I am committed to concept based

00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:31,729
learning because I think it's a way

00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:33,559
forward for our kids my kids educator

00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:35,719
Ken Robinson said what you're doing now

00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:37,399
or have done in the past need not

00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:41,479
determine what you can do next in the

00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:44,539
future I aim to be a person who supports

00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:47,050
thinking students for a thinking future

00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:47,050
