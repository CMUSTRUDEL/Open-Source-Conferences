Publication date: 2018-10-31
Playlist: View Source 2018 - London
Description: 
	Shall we talk about audio? I mean there's no place for that in a browser right? Annoying background sound, auto playing videos ðŸ™„... but wait! What about games, apps, XR, web assembly giving us the power to compile a whole new world in this environment?

With new policies being discussed to make it less offensive, and technologies to make it run smoothly, audio is coming of age. After rocky beginnings back in the nineties, single thread issue with the birth of the Web Audio API, things are changing and really it's here to stay.

Ruth takes us through the basics, best practises and these changes. Welcome to a whole new exciting world of sound, a world where the browser suddenly stops shouting and becomes an adult.
