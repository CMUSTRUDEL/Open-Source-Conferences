Title: View Source 2018 - Ruth John  - Developments in the Web Audio API
Publication date: 2018-10-31
Playlist: View Source 2018 - London
Description: 
	Shall we talk about audio? I mean there's no place for that in a browser right? Annoying background sound, auto playing videos ðŸ™„... but wait! What about games, apps, XR, web assembly giving us the power to compile a whole new world in this environment?

With new policies being discussed to make it less offensive, and technologies to make it run smoothly, audio is coming of age. After rocky beginnings back in the nineties, single thread issue with the birth of the Web Audio API, things are changing and really it's here to stay.

Ruth takes us through the basics, best practises and these changes. Welcome to a whole new exciting world of sound, a world where the browser suddenly stops shouting and becomes an adult.

	00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:08,130
hello Vsauce I always do this one day

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:10,410
I'm gonna write a talk that doesn't

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,500
involve any JavaScript or any hardware

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,330
or any audio and I'm always like yeah

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,949
but that would be really boring wouldn't

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,660
it my name is Ruth I'm gonna sort of cut

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,039
out that really long intro because they

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,720
do have a lot to get through I've only

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,310
got half an hour and I did a run-through

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,890
in my hotel room and I was like oh my

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,710
goodness me this is like an hour so I'm

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,480
gonna talk very very fast I apologize in

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,910
advance I hope if you're not a native

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,120
speaker that I don't talk too fast for

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,219
you

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,140
I have captions so that is actually

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:46,020
helpful thank you very much there hmm

00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:47,489
great if you do need to find me I'm a

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,980
tree Mira on the internet so you can

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,510
find me on github code pen twitter at

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,250
room ira right so you can ask me any

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,840
questions on there you can find all my

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,399
code examples everything on there and

00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,539
they are going to get tweeted out via

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,710
the account as i go so it's all good now

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,719
the reason that I have so much to get

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,470
through is I'm here to talk to you about

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,450
Web Audio right that's this

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,250
specification this is me scrolling

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,430
through the specification without

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,100
stopping sped up two-and-a-half times it

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,020
took me eight minutes I think it's the

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:25,560
longest web api specification that we

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:27,600
have it's it's very intimidating and it

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,210
is very long I'm gonna try and break it

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,590
down for you big shout out here this is

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,780
going to happen throughout the talk if

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,290
you do want to look anything up that I

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,990
talked about

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,470
shout out to mdn docks it's a little bit

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,659
more digestible right this is me

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,579
scrolling through in real time I'm

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,140
having a good time it takes me through

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,460
everything that I need to know this is

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,189
great I kind of want to get in the end

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,140
because it's nice you're like super

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:53,939
chill yeah I mean it's still quite long

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,369
it's still quite a hefty specification

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,200
like what some workers in there I will

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,229
get what gets that that's cool some

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,820
example code MD ins great isn't it I'm

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:07,429
going to shout out throughout this whole

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:11,310
talk it's gonna be bro dude dude dude

00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:13,910
was this article helpful yes it was

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,590
thank you very much Rosella

00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:20,250
that there is this barrier of entry with

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,990
audio and it's not just a specification

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,190
like this and it is pretty hard if you

00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,650
don't come from a musical background

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,630
when I talk to developers about all yet

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:32,910
I can see their faces their brains are

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:34,800
sort of doing things right this is a

00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,600
real website this is Cameron's world

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,800
don't know it is relatively new but this

00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,510
is what we think about we think about

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,640
that in 1998 background sound tag and

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,500
you're like yeah that's not even a tag

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,260
like that's not an HTML element anymore

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,090
it is depreciated we don't have to build

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,730
things that look like that anymore

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,110
the web has moved on and then we do have

00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,030
the modern-day equivalent you know

00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,410
you're reading an article you're a young

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,450
mom you want to make 9 grand a month

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,250
great and then this video starts playing

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,960
right on the right and you're like I

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,820
don't want to hear that you can't hear

00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,530
sounds actually really low on my neck up

00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,640
at the moment doing audio talk where

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,230
your sounds low definitely the way to go

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,820
there are some policies in place that

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,860
are coming out now to stop this auto

00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,780
playing when you do load on websites I'm

00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,790
going to talk about that as well so

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,560
barring these things in mind we don't

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,970
have background sound we're not going to

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,030
do horrible things like make it load

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,560
like autoplay when we make websites I

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,820
think that we can create better

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,410
experiences for our users this is my

00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,270
favorite this is a project from Norway

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,530
it's called future library and they're

00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,450
growing they're growing a forest they're

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,710
having a tree for every single year and

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,270
they're getting an author to write a

00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:45,060
book for every single tree that they

00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,650
grow and there's this sort of ambient

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,900
background noise as if you're in a

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,190
forest this isn't just a website where

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,110
you're going to read some content this

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,430
is an experience and it takes you

00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,840
through all the books and it takes you

00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,520
through the authors and it's really

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,430
really lovely and that sound is not

00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:03,390
obtrusive it's not sort of aggressive

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:05,400
it's just a really nice experience this

00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,620
is a project called 86 and a half years

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,430
it's a story website about the musings

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:14,190
of an eighty six and a half year old man

00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:16,350
again it's just a lovely ambient sound

00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,570
that I'm listening to which adds to the

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,880
whole experience is not detracting from

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,820
it it's not it's not detracting from you

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,750
experiencing the website there is a

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,750
place for audio

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,290
the weather's connectivity its

00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:34,090
information it's education ableton

00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,820
they're a company that make musical

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:39,490
instrument hardware and software for

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,680
doing music on the OS they built

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,750
learning music store Ableton calm and

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,670
sure they are heavily invested in music

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,680
but this takes you through sort of the

00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:50,080
beginnings of electronic music and beats

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,880
and since and drums and things like that

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,010
and they wouldn't have been able to do

00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,620
this if it hadn't been for the Web Audio

00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:58,840
API it has given us the power to do

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:02,470
things like education which i think is

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:06,070
brilliant how do we go about creating

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:09,490
experiences like this I have got about

00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,900
20 minutes all right it's gonna be a

00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,760
whirlwind tour I hope you're ready what

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,670
I'm gonna start with is a little lesson

00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,790
about digital audio hoping oh please let

00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:20,919
this slide work okay yes you've probably

00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:23,080
all seen a graph that looks like this

00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:25,000
right this is depicting a sound wave

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,460
we're probably all well aware that sound

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,590
travels through materials in ways just

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,510
like light does as I'm talking to you

00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,040
that sound is going through the air it's

00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,810
hitting your eardrum you're picking up

00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,940
on it and you're hearing it that is how

00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:40,419
sound works this is how we depict it

00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:42,010
this is actually a very pure wave this

00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:45,220
is a sine wave it sounds a little bit

00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:46,479
like as you can hear there's no sort of

00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,210
noise apart from my lovely little

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,430
crackle at the end there and this is

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:54,280
this is easy to generate electronically

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,110
what I'm speaking to you doesn't look

00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,090
like this what I'm speaking to you

00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,919
although my voice is lovely and you know

00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,169
beautiful it doesn't look like this it

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,570
looks like more of a jaggedy wave right

00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:07,060
so what do we have we have this sort of

00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:09,310
wave over time that's your horizontal

00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:13,510
axis and we've got this sort of

00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:17,229
amplitude value on the y-axis that up

00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:20,110
and down and all we all we want to do

00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:23,860
with digital is we want to record the

00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:25,750
y-axis at any given time right this is

00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,700
where we start to talk about sample rate

00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,340
all we want to do is record that number

00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:33,450
at certain intervals so that when we

00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:35,440
play it back we can recreate that wave a

00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,030
normal sample rate would be something

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,820
like forty four point one kilohertz

00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:41,940
that's 44

00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,100
thousand one hundred numbers per second

00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:47,010
that we are recording that's a lot of

00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,860
numbers but as a simplified version that

00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:51,480
all digital audio really is it's all it

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,160
boils down to it's just a file of

00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,010
numbers that then just gets recreated

00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,290
and played back as soon as you sort of

00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,270
get that everything else becomes a

00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:02,430
little bit easier because all we're

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:06,300
doing is manipulating those numbers when

00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:09,480
we do stuff with audio okay simplify

00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:12,150
digital audio lesson over right now we

00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:16,400
can start to write some code Web Audio

00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:20,370
API how do we do that loads of code

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,750
we're instigating a context right that

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,580
we only need to do this once per

00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,920
applications in my talk I'm just gonna

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,050
do it once and I'm just doing new audio

00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,540
context this is giving me all the power

00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,040
of the Web Audio API I now have all the

00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,260
methods and all the properties I'm going

00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,360
to need to be able to create some audio

00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,890
to load some audio to manipulate that

00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,160
audio I'll take you through some of the

00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:43,920
stuff that it can do we need some sound

00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,360
we've got our Web Audio API we need some

00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,280
sound there's plenty of ways to do this

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,860
with the Web Audio API I'm gonna take

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,960
you through three ways to load it you

00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,540
can grab it from the dom if you have a

00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,180
video or audio element within your dong

00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,970
you can just grab the audio source from

00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,500
that and your audio API is then taking

00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,910
over that audio source oh all the

00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,040
manipulation that you can do with the

00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,320
Web Audio API is going to go through

00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,730
that the HTML media element that video

00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,020
or audio element is going to stay the

00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,610
same you still get the power so you

00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,380
still got all the events on that element

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,830
but the audio is going to go through the

00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,690
Web Audio API you can stream it so you

00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,580
can grab the sound from your camera or

00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:22,050
the microphone on your device and then

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,940
you can stream it into the Web Audio API

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,630
there's a method to do that that's

00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,240
pretty cool

00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:29,670
or you can just go and get a far HTTP

00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,470
request a file now this is a little bit

00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:33,390
more complicated because audio files

00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:36,090
usually are compressed so you've got

00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:38,460
things like mp3s waves black things like

00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:40,349
that you have to make it into a format

00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,849
of the Web Audio API can understand it

00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:43,700
so what we're doing is we're going to

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:46,500
get a file here we're going to actually

00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,450
decode that data into a buffer for the

00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,450
audio API so the audio API can read

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,649
those numbers write buffers are

00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,149
important we're going to get back

00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:56,459
them later but that's what we're doing

00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:58,550
in any of these instances we're just

00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:02,220
going to give the Audio API some numbers

00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:03,689
we've got some sound but we still

00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,749
haven't been able to play that sound

00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:08,249
we're only just fetching the source here

00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:11,639
to be able to actually play it we have

00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:13,649
to connect it to a destination and play

00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:15,480
it this is where the Audio API Cup

00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:16,860
becomes just a little bit more like you

00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,040
have to do quite a lot of stuff for very

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,689
little sometimes so here I'm connecting

00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,509
what we've got before that any of these

00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:26,850
can be our source and I'm connecting

00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:28,769
that to the destination a context

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,290
destination by default this is your

00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:33,179
speakers this can be other things you

00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,490
can write it to file you can stream it

00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:36,959
do some WebRTC stuff but by default I'm

00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:40,170
just going to connect it to my speaker's

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:43,079
then I'm going to start it so start

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:45,240
start that's the method quite a lot of

00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:46,559
stuff just to get some sound playing but

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,110
there's some cool stuff we get there

00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:52,199
boarding up here I'll get to this goes a

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:54,029
little something like there that's all

00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:56,129
I've done I've gone to get a file to

00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:58,790
code it into a buffer and connected it

00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,790
to my speakers

00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:07,769
great ten minutes down I'm gonna mention

00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,569
it a little bit so you can't see that to

00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:10,769
you clearly and it'll be about audio

00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:12,749
graph and nose because we talk about

00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:13,949
these a lot in audio especially when

00:10:12,749 --> 00:10:16,709
we're working with the Web Audio API

00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:18,959
you're going to hear those terms nodes

00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:20,609
are that source that we had and the

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,169
destination they're both nodes I've got

00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:23,519
a source node we've got a destination

00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:24,899
node and we're going to look at some

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,149
modification those in a minute they're

00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:29,009
gonna sit in the middle here they're all

00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:30,989
just the things that do stuff I'm gonna

00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:32,970
get something I'm gonna I'm gonna pass

00:10:30,989 --> 00:10:34,709
it over here I'm gonna filter it I'm

00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,959
gonna change the volume there all your

00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:38,189
nodes what we tend to do is this tends

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,600
to get very complicated very quickly

00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:41,189
because we tend to do a lot of stuff

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,589
with audio and so it's really nice to

00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:44,850
draw it out so you do a little box for

00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:47,239
each node and then you link them all

00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:51,299
together so you know which things a

00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:53,519
modification which sounds so we draw an

00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:55,019
audio graph so this is a really really

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,029
simple audio graph we've got a source

00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:59,039
node it's connected to the destination

00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:02,939
node these get a lot more complicated

00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:04,649
this is a very simple example one fun

00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:06,749
piece of functionality that you might

00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:07,829
need as a developer on a website and I

00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,029
know that devices have this

00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:11,339
functionality but it's always nice to

00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:13,859
keep it within the interface itself is

00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:16,139
mute functionality or just volume

00:11:13,859 --> 00:11:17,759
control right because some you know your

00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:19,319
volume might be too high for them maybe

00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,869
they might want to turn it up you never

00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:23,669
know the two examples I showed earlier

00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:25,499
there was actually no mute on there a

00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:27,600
six and a half years and which I do

00:11:25,499 --> 00:11:29,549
think is a bad UX like I can turn it

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,699
down on my laptop but I think it is nice

00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:34,739
to keep yourself in that experience the

00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:37,529
way that we do that is we create another

00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:40,019
node in the Web Audio API so we create a

00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:43,499
gain node the gain node is going to

00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:45,689
control the volume right and how we do

00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:49,230
that is we create it and we can set the

00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:51,419
value of the gain naught is unmuted one

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,639
is keep it at the volume it is two is

00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:55,709
double the volume right pretty simple

00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:57,209
stuff and that's all I'm doing here but

00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:59,429
we do have to remember I've created the

00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:00,869
gain node I set the value of what I want

00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:02,549
it to be here it's naught because I

00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:04,919
don't want any sound but I've had to

00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:07,379
connect it through my audio graph right

00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:09,359
so the source is now connected to the

00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:11,640
gain which is now connected to the

00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:13,830
destination

00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:22,830
cool so we've got some mute

00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:23,820
functionality and our audio graph looks

00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,380
a little bit like this you've got a

00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,650
source you've got a gain node and we've

00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,000
got our destination Web Audio basics if

00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:33,150
that was all a little bit too much all

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,370
you want to try it there is a tutorial

00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:41,010
and mdn Doc's yeah someone wrote that it

00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:42,570
takes you through everything I think

00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,920
it's really coincidental I've come here

00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,960
to talk about it you know just happens

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,190
you written a tutorial it takes you

00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,630
through everything that I just said so

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,240
all the beginnings to instigate the Web

00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:52,860
Audio API doing some funny control you

00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,090
can even do some stereo panning so you

00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,560
can actually get this to pan left and

00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:57,270
right to your speakers because that's

00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,190
another node that we have with the Web

00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,320
Audio API there's a whole bunch of

00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:04,320
modification nodes I don't have time to

00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,460
take you through all of them but if you

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,300
go and have a look at these tutorials

00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,920
and you can have a look at the

00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,570
documentation now that you understand

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,010
that concept you'll probably be able to

00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:15,870
take get a grasp on all the different

00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:17,520
ones that we have new thing just a shout

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:21,720
out I want to talk about the autoplay

00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:23,880
policy just briefly here there's a lot

00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,740
of sort of random information about the

00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,420
autoplay policy it's all to do with when

00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,340
you land on a website not having videos

00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,440
autoplay for you're not having like loud

00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,880
music autoplay for you I'm sure at some

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,010
point is probably going to start

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,810
including like flashy animations not

00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:38,160
auto-playing because that can be you

00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:41,280
know detrimental for users as well as

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,930
far as the Web Audio API is concerned

00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,980
the bit that we interested in I really

00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,510
wish there was a proper technical

00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,610
specification for your token equality

00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:50,340
but there isn't create or resume a

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:53,250
context context from inside a user

00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:55,860
gesture so the context that we have this

00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,840
Web Audio context comes with the state

00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,360
and when we started it should be running

00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:03,270
so that we can play things but if we

00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,520
start it outside of a user gesture so a

00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:07,440
user hasn't had any interaction it will

00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,510
actually start to set suspended so you

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,400
can't actually play anything so you

00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,410
can't actually do like load something

00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,710
and have something playing right that's

00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:18,180
the idea so if you want audio to play

00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:20,070
you have to have some sort of user

00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,830
interaction with your page before the

00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:25,220
audio will play so a good check is say

00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:28,560
we've just gotten a click event going on

00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:31,020
check the audio contact state if it's

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,420
suspended then change it to running by

00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:35,459
doing audio context resume and that's

00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,899
all you need to do just to go over the

00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:39,060
autoplay policy it's probably going to

00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:40,350
be in your browser soon and it just

00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,940
means if you are working with the Web

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,380
Audio API and things aren't playing it

00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,520
might have something to do with that you

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:49,050
need a user gesture first other places

00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,250
that you might need audio other places

00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,420
that are getting very popular at the

00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,330
moment I kind of lump these on them

00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,980
together things like WebGL

00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:58,290
gaming XR that is gaining in popularity

00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,240
now the reason I've lumped these all

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,740
together it's just good because we call

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,890
it something in audio we call it

00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:07,589
spatialization now this is the idea that

00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:09,720
audio actually is directional and in

00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:13,760
space right so if you can think about it

00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:16,260
like this you are listening to me speak

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,880
I doesn't really wear everywhere because

00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,200
I am going through a mic so you are

00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,020
hearing me at through speakers but if I

00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,870
wasn't you would hear me from here and

00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:27,060
if I moved over here where I am where

00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:29,160
the audio source is has changed if I was

00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,020
above you you would hear me from above

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,940
you and as a human you're pretty good at

00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,890
this right your ears are good at knowing

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,630
where sounds are around you you can

00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,720
probably cross the road closing your

00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:42,630
eyes actually if you think about it

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:45,240
don't do that like you probably are

00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:47,790
quite good at it and this is what this

00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,180
does we have a Panna node in the Web

00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:54,630
Audio API and this allows you to do all

00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,850
of that audio spatialization it is quite

00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:59,070
complicated you can see it here we have

00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,959
to set a listener so if you're my

00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,720
listener audience I have to set where

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,980
you are and which way you are facing

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,390
then I have to do the same thing with

00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,899
the sound source but it does get quite

00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,940
complicated

00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:12,029
I have to set where I am which way I'm

00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,920
facing and do movements you can do

00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:16,110
things like cones if you think of sound

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,079
like light and you have like spotlights

00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:20,520
spotlights have cones so does sound so

00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,660
you can have omnidirectional sound that

00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,730
goes all the way around or you can have

00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:28,140
sound that's directional you can set all

00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:29,940
of that with this one note right pretty

00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:32,160
complicated I won't go through all of

00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,570
them new thing you might notice here

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,550
I've got Const Panna equal new pan

00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:38,530
note this is a new thing this is a

00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:40,420
class-based way of instigating nodes

00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:43,390
before when we are creating our game

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:45,010
node we just did context create gain and

00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,030
we had a gain node that's the factory

00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,720
way of doing it that's how we've always

00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,670
done it

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,350
we now have you can use both you can use

00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,640
either or it doesn't matter but this is

00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,230
sort of a little bit nice a little bit

00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,750
more extendable especially when we've

00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:57,220
got all of these properties to set it

00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,640
actually looks a little bit better so

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,900
new thing class-based Intex nice didn't

00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,120
don't know if you don't get it but if

00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,890
you are interested in specialization

00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,470
because it is really interesting but

00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:11,820
very in-depth there's a tutorial for

00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:13,959
that and the end hooks

00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,280
there's a little boom box here I'm

00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:17,350
wondering if I can actually play with it

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,990
without breaking my entire don't write

00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,280
things in JavaScript everybody so yeah

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,660
you can move this around and it will

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,459
play and you can zoom in and out and you

00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,860
can hear that audio change whilst you do

00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:27,880
it so there's an article it takes you

00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:31,150
through everything and all the different

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,950
parts and it's not just gaming and crazy

00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,500
3d things as well this does appear on

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:38,890
websites I'm any Harry Potter I feel

00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:41,170
like I've on there we go unactivated

00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,760
everything ok many Harry Potter fans

00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:44,770
might have seen the Hogwarts WebGL

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,240
website they used a lot of sound

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,640
spatialization in there because they had

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,100
things flying overhead and sounds coming

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,690
from like way over there it was all kind

00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,870
of spooky it's a really nice example of

00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,520
this spatialization I would recommend

00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,260
that if you do want to do it I don't

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,830
usually recommend this it's quite heavy

00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:06,400
on the maths 3GS and a frame the WebGL

00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:09,960
frame libraries they do harness this so

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,960
you can just use what they've baked in

00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:19,080
music right so any musicians out there I

00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:21,910
kind of had to keep this in here this is

00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,980
block dust built by Luke time and Luke

00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:26,460
Phillips and Edison and brighten this is

00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,960
actually an online synthesizer right

00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,580
it's if you're not do you not familiar

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,290
with synths and drum machines and

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,940
sequences and all this crazy stuff that

00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,990
we do the electronic instrument it is a

00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,490
little bit confusing but it is really

00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,350
nice to play with and they kind of

00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,640
reinvented the interface a little bit

00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,560
because we're so used to these things

00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,820
being hardware the wonderful thing about

00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,900
the web is that it can actually be

00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,130
software and you can do whatever you

00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,050
want I mean look how pretty it is

00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,620
nothing else you can appreciate that

00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:52,750
right

00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:54,550
um the Web Audio API obviously gives you

00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,920
all the abilities to sort of make noises

00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,120
and make instruments and do all of this

00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,550
it's just probably what you've seen a

00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:04,840
lot of so I will cover this because I've

00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:06,610
got another we can make sounds with the

00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,440
Web Audio API that's sine wave that you

00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:10,059
saw earlier that's pretty easy to

00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,309
generate electronically we have an

00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:15,490
oscillator node that's going to generate

00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:17,230
the sound you can create like the four

00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,640
basic types of ways we've got the sine

00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,679
wave which is curvy you've got a square

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,580
wave which is like this Square triangle

00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:22,870
and sawtooth

00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,040
the reason you've got those for us

00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,200
because they're easy to generate

00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,960
electronically you can actually set your

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,640
own wave so you can actually create what

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,770
we call a wave table which ends up being

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,690
like 4,000 lines of jobs good it's kind

00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,040
of crazy but you can actually set your

00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,390
sort of measurements of your own wave

00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:42,790
and you could pop that in the oscillator

00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:45,130
as well these values that we set on

00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:47,080
these nodes so our gain node we've had a

00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,300
value from like noir or 1 or 2 or

00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,070
whatever we want and it's the same with

00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,500
the oscillator when we create an

00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:55,450
oscillator we can change its like tone

00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,570
its frequency so we can make it low or

00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:01,120
we can make it high these values that we

00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:03,730
can set we call them a type audio / M

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,230
now these audio parameter types come

00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,330
with a whole bunch of stuff into

00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:12,240
themselves as well like this API just

00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:18,340
keeps on going so what I'm doing here

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:20,020
just quickly everybody their frequency

00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,160
I'm styling it you heard the same way of

00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,200
earlier I'm saying it there and I'm just

00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,850
dropping it off flow pretty quickly in

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,740
about a second but I'm doing it in a

00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:28,240
nice curved fashion the same with the

00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,070
gain I'm starting at 1 and I'm just

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:36,100
going to drop it off in a nice curved

00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:46,020
fashion and if I do that got a laser in

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:48,900
like that much code but obviously do say

00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:52,390
like you can just go mad with this stuff

00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:54,040
which people do do remember me talking

00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:55,450
about buffers and how we take that file

00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,790
and we put the data or we make it

00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,410
readable by the Audio API you can create

00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,500
an empty one of these and fill it with

00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:03,290
your own

00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:06,830
des that's also pretty cool because if

00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:09,220
we feel like this empty container with

00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:12,620
random numbers we're probably gonna get

00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:15,490
white noise he's like yeah no that is

00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:21,980
random numbers and be aware of this one

00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:23,570
it doesn't sound great tota we can make

00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,010
that sound better so that is just me

00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:26,810
creating an empty container putting in

00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:29,240
random numbers that's made some white

00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:30,740
noise we do have some more nodes you

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,720
have some more modifications to make

00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,640
that to make that help we've got some

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,990
filters we can shape here we can put

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,600
some reverb on it that's going to put an

00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:39,800
echo on it we could use any of those I'm

00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,960
actually going to filter out some of

00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:47,120
those frequencies just to make it sound

00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:49,490
like less pissy and less tinny nicer we

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,280
actually call that brown noise that is

00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,810
actually too far nothing else today I've

00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:57,740
known what brown noise is it's white

00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:59,630
noise without the hiss so that's great

00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,400
and if I did what I did earlier where I

00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:07,190
dropped off that frequency and I dropped

00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:08,900
off that gain okay I got a snare just

00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:13,490
like that that just came from the white

00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:16,010
noise right and we do you have a new

00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:18,290
filter in the Web Audio API it's the IIR

00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:20,930
filter I really don't have time to go

00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:23,600
into this this is like quite a low level

00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:25,450
signal processing and by quad filter

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,680
which is what I used to take those high

00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,270
frequencies off of that white noise I

00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,130
was basically just filtering off those

00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:35,450
high frequencies that's why we call it a

00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:37,820
filter it is a type of iÃ­r is like one

00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:39,200
level down where you have to set up all

00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:42,440
the parameters yourself

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:45,530
it is quite involved but if you're into

00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,390
it it's really cool to play with and if

00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:50,930
you are interested somebody wrote an

00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:51,980
article of haha it's not only hooks go

00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:54,230
home and check it out

00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,850
I want you to read this one it's always

00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:58,220
really hard to write because it is it

00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:01,040
sort of like polynomial maths and you

00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:04,810
know this bat and you're like oh that

00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:08,300
one was difficult okay

00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:09,770
timing timing is important with audio if

00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,450
you go at a time and you're playing live

00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:13,010
in a band I really know is that imagine

00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,960
the drummer going out time timing is

00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,760
important we have

00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,919
property on the context it's called

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,630
current time it works on system hydrate

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,399
doesn't work on JavaScript timing

00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,870
functions they're a bit of a nightmare

00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:24,279
they don't stay on time

00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:26,409
because they're working with lots of

00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:28,450
other stuff going on so this keeps

00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:29,710
things in time again I don't have all

00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,140
the time in the world to go into it in

00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:34,179
depth there's an article by Chris Wilson

00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,380
called a tale of two Crocs I recommend

00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,460
you reading that if you do want to go

00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,990
through all the different JavaScript

00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,570
timing functions and how you can

00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:45,059
incorporate context current time and

00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:47,470
have a nice time of it pun intended so

00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:49,270
we can actually like the hi hat was made

00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:51,370
of very soon release to the snare just

00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:53,380
like made the frequency a little bit

00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,760
higher and I'm just using that current

00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:59,080
time to sort of loop over it and play it

00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:02,679
I would say it was pretty accurate right

00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,809
it's just giving me a second value back

00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:08,590
off of my hardware and I can hook into

00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:12,070
that and I can do my timing worth of

00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:14,440
mention new things audio worklets really

00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,000
glad that we had some discussion about

00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,940
workers because I don't have so you well

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,760
workers this is like the space station

00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:26,350
with a recording studio already on it

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:28,539
right this is the thread that has been

00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:30,700
taken away and now you have pretty much

00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:32,649
a lot of what the Web Audio API gives

00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,659
you but you are doing it like not on

00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:37,840
this main thread which is great because

00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:41,830
we had this idea when it first like the

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,570
spec first came out 2011 2012 and we've

00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:45,010
just been waiting and it came out last

00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:46,299
year and ivories really really excited

00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,679
because it's taking away a lot of things

00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:49,600
like latency issues when you are just

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,520
working directly in that browser you

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,880
still do have a lot of problems with all

00:24:51,520 --> 00:25:00,730
that processing that's going on I know a

00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:02,260
snippet of code if you are interested in

00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,429
more of the instrumental kind of stuff I

00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,200
just went through because I did just go

00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:06,340
over it very very briefly and I'm sorry

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,559
that I didn't have a little bit more

00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:12,940
time for it there's a tutorial about

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:14,919
empty talks so one row here you can

00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:16,659
build a little step sequencer it's

00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:18,669
actually pretty cool and say this is a

00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:20,350
little thing that goes through and you

00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:21,549
could create all the different sounds so

00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,960
you can actually get to create a drum

00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:24,010
and all the rest of it and it will take

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,539
you through all the more advanced

00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:27,789
techniques in lieu of Audio API and all

00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:31,029
the different nodes that you have

00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:32,350
fist bump whoa 20 minutes Web Audio API

00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,299
well done everybody I don't think I've

00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:36,700
ever done it that quickly use me is

00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:42,609
about 40 minutes so yeah we're done I'm

00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:45,940
happy I have to include this in here

00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:47,679
okay so it's giving me not MIDI right

00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:49,389
because you can't talk about audio that

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:55,179
talking about if you can but I'm not

00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:56,499
going to the thing they say the reason

00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:58,960
is because I want to re-educate

00:25:56,499 --> 00:26:00,580
everybody this what we saw this is not

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,489
MIDI I know that it sounds like bleep II

00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:06,070
like that 80s kind of noise those noises

00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:07,629
that you are hearing that is audio all

00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:10,389
those noises you hear you do that with

00:26:07,629 --> 00:26:13,529
the Web Audio API the web MIDI API is a

00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:16,570
separate API and it's just a digital

00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:19,299
protocol right it is just messages being

00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,769
sent around instruments it sort of it so

00:26:19,299 --> 00:26:23,109
came about because the rise of

00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:24,879
electronic or popularity of electronic

00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:27,159
instruments in the 70s the first

00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:29,619
specification came out in 1983 and it is

00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:32,169
all to do with these instruments being

00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:34,210
able to talk to each other so all it is

00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:36,099
is you press the a key of playing a

00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,659
keyboard and it's just sending messages

00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:40,450
so that other instruments know when that

00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:42,820
keyboard is playing right a little thing

00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:44,590
to note is that the keyboard is an

00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,999
instrument it's a MIDI na what

00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,590
instrument if you are playing a keyboard

00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:52,330
like a piano not the cube or a new

00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:53,859
laptop that has onboard audio so that is

00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:56,019
an instrument and standalone it will

00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:57,820
play and most keyboards these they are

00:26:56,019 --> 00:26:59,289
merely enabled so they will also send

00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,580
these MIDI messages as well so if you

00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:01,809
plug it into your computer you can pick

00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,970
up on those MIDI messages

00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:06,340
these are MIDI controllers these are

00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:07,389
sort of roughly speaking a little bit

00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,729
cheaper because they don't have that

00:27:07,389 --> 00:27:12,220
onboard audio and all they are it's just

00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:14,639
a box of buttons that send MIDI messages

00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:17,559
I have one right here

00:27:14,639 --> 00:27:18,639
it's just a box of buttons that sends me

00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:20,200
messages I can plug that into my

00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:22,210
computer and in my browser I can pick up

00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,279
on those messages right there's a little

00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:25,869
bit of code there all I'm doing is just

00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:28,059
requesting access to it and then

00:27:25,869 --> 00:27:29,889
listening for any button presses right

00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:33,690
and then I'm going to do some stuff now

00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:37,779
this is where we go may or may not work

00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:41,200
as I'm pressing my buttons this is

00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:49,960
basically that's the next demo

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:54,100
thanks to okay don't do live demos on

00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,750
stage with JavaScript just FYI this is

00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:59,230
the so data that you get back right and

00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:02,170
it's all to do with which sort of button

00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:03,760
you're pressing which controller that

00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:05,110
you have and sometimes you have velocity

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,970
as well so the harder you press you get

00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,890
a different value which it can be really

00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:11,320
really interesting and you can do all

00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:13,270
sorts of stuff with this um as you heard

00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,100
we can take the noises that you had

00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:17,260
earlier

00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:30,670
you've now kind of stops

00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:39,490
we got press the buttons and kick off

00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:40,840
those sounds see I do great demo anyway

00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:44,590
you must have a play we have a play

00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,910
layer I've got it here I've got a bit

00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,350
that you don't actually create a website

00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:51,400
that used under these to control the

00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:53,530
website right yeah that happened the

00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,330
artist made you in from France we make

00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:56,410
awesome as you created this website you

00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,790
can actually plug one of these in

00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:59,080
actually one of these launch pads that's

00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,310
what this one is called there's lots and

00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,650
lots of different controllers out there

00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:04,000
that you can get it works without it so

00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,230
you can just go and you can just click

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,180
on the interface and it will play you

00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,680
sounds or you can plug one of these in

00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,790
and then I can actually play it using

00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,060
one of these which i think is really

00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:15,010
interesting Novation they have a

00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:17,560
synthesizer where they update this into

00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:19,480
the size of via a web app right so you

00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:22,030
can put all your samples and you can use

00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,190
this piece of software by plugging in

00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:26,380
your synth into your computer so this is

00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:28,510
harnessing Web Audio and web MIDI a lot

00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:30,370
so this is actual real stuff that people

00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:33,340
are actually doing actual companies are

00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:36,040
using this in real life and you can also

00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:38,170
you know just change text size like

00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,880
Laurie cape dude like why not I mean

00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:41,170
this is just picking up on events I

00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,610
think it's an amazing way to hardware

00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,600
enable your browser which I'm quite

00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,680
excited about because that's basically

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,510
the next door

00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,370
oh just cuz I wanted to I was tiny

00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:50,710
weenie just wanted to keep visual in

00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:54,340
there I can just change my visuals by

00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:56,590
pressing buttons which is what I do

00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:58,179
I know that some of these demos are not

00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:59,890
necessarily the things that you're gonna

00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:02,770
go and start developing on Monday

00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:05,320
morning but I do hope that I've given

00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:06,970
you an overview of how maybe audio

00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,980
something that we can start to think

00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:11,200
about on the web one of my friends said

00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:13,150
recently that the internet and digital

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,230
is like being in a mall it's like being

00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,820
in a shopping center

00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:17,980
everything's adverts and everything's

00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:19,179
loud and bright lights and everybody's

00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,580
trying to sell us something and we

00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:23,200
actually need some more parks and we

00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:25,450
need some more oceans and we need some

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,520
more forests and the sound that comes

00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:30,760
with that that's very different and it's

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,830
actually very nice so please go forth

00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,880
make noise thank you very much for

00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,490
letting me talk to you about your audio

00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:40,019
API
