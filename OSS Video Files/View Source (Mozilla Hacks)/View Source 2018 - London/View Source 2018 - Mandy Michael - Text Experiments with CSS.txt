Description: 
	Interesting and impactful text is often deemed a “print only option”. But we can have those effects now in our web projects with real web text. 

I'll show you how to recreate photoshop effects and bring your own text effects to life all while maintaining accessible, searchable, and selectable text using CSS and HTML. 

We’ll explore a variety of techniques combining old and new CSS properties and values including pseudo-elements, clip-path, blend modes, gradients, transforms, variable fonts and more to create interesting and inspiring headings and layouts. 

It's never been a better time to stand out and experiment with the power of CSS.
