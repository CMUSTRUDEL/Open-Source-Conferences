Title: View Source 2018 - Mandy Michael - Text Experiments with CSS
Publication date: 2018-10-31
Playlist: View Source 2018 - London
Description: 
	Interesting and impactful text is often deemed a “print only option”. But we can have those effects now in our web projects with real web text. 

I'll show you how to recreate photoshop effects and bring your own text effects to life all while maintaining accessible, searchable, and selectable text using CSS and HTML. 

We’ll explore a variety of techniques combining old and new CSS properties and values including pseudo-elements, clip-path, blend modes, gradients, transforms, variable fonts and more to create interesting and inspiring headings and layouts. 

It's never been a better time to stand out and experiment with the power of CSS.

00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,290
[Music]

00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:11,730
it's going to last for 30 minutes if it

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,299
doesn't I was given permission to do the

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,650
rest of my talk in interpretive dance I

00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:20,609
really hope for your sake it doesn't

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,740
come to that one anyway before I get

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:23,939
into the demos and stuff I'm going to

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,430
talk about today there's a couple of

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:29,310
things I want to make really clear I am

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,590
NOT a designer I consider myself a

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,420
developer so keep that in mind when you

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,410
look at my text effects but also like

00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,239
all of these things are kind of

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,059
experiments and demos and I've just kind

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,850
of gone is that possible with CSS and

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,469
then I've made it so it's a little bit

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,890
of a hobby for me I do it for a bit of

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,480
fun and just so you know for every

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,070
example that you're going to see today

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,899
there's probably like five or ten

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,719
sitting in my private crude pens

00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,660
unfinished so if you're like sitting

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,609
there thinking I could never do that

00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:04,769
that's what I thought before I made them

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,390
so you know I keep an open mind you

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,810
never really know what you're capable of

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,280
until you give it a try so I am going to

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,549
talk about creating text effects with

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,619
CSS today and it's less about creating

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:18,810
specific effects and more about how it

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,630
can combine new and existing CSS

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,530
properties and values to create new and

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:28,320
interesting text and layouts on the web

00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:30,630
with CSS specifically I think there's a

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:36,930
lot we often think is impossible with

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:38,189
CSS and I don't believe that there's so

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,049
many new things that have come out

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,880
especially in recent years and with a

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,110
little bit of exploration and creativity

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,340
we can create some really incredible

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:50,700
things especially things that maybe we

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,850
thought had to be an image or SVG or

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,229
canvas or some other technology so

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,520
what's really important about the

00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,490
effects I'm going to show you is that

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,560
they're all just text they're editable

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,290
they're selectable so you can copy and

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,750
paste them they're searchable so you can

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,970
search them with Google they can be

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,550
indexed and also they're accessible via

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,900
a screen reader because after all the

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,670
web is all about text

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,579
and we need to make the most of that as

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,230
much as we can so the goal for all of

00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:22,049
the text effects that I'm going to show

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,090
you they are made to be able to replace

00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:25,799
things like canvas and SVG and

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,870
JavaScript that doesn't mean that

00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:29,220
there's anything wrong with them you can

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,930
combine these effects with those

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,239
technologies and do even more incredible

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,810
things but for today I'm gonna try and

00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,470
not use them as much as possible so on

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,909
that note

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,099
my name is Mannie Michael I'm a

00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:43,109
front-end developer I am on Twitter as

00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:45,599
many underscore ker and I'm code pandas

00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:47,879
Mandy Michael all of the title slides

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,010
all of the demos are up on code pen I

00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,989
will tweet out a link at the end but if

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,829
you want to have a play with them you

00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:58,200
can go and do that later

00:02:54,829 --> 00:03:00,359
so how do we make text effects with CSS

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,639
there's two things that I think that we

00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:04,620
need in order to make text effects on

00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:08,189
the web and the first one is data

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,780
attributes so a data attribute it's a

00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,760
custom attribute that allows us to

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,950
exchange information between the HTML

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,959
and the DOM and in our case we're going

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,410
to use it to share the content of our

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:22,349
HTML element with our CSS and the way

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:24,419
that you use a data attribute you add it

00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:27,739
on to your HTML element so in this case

00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:29,819
a h1 all weights prefix it with data -

00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:34,409
can call it whatever you want

00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:36,329
heading Mandie Batman whatever suits you

00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:38,940
heading seems to make sense in this case

00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:40,620
and that's what I went with and for the

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,199
majority of the effects we're going to

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,419
make we're going to put whatever is in

00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,229
the HTML element in the data attribute

00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:51,569
as the value so in this case hello

00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:54,120
now you can make them different and I do

00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:56,790
make some effects like this but for the

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,940
purposes of today let's just assume that

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,949
it's going to be the same so on its own

00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,569
the pseudo element sorry the data

00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:06,060
attributes aren't going to do a lot for

00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:09,449
us so that's why we need the second

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,250
thing which is a pseudo element now the

00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:13,049
pseudo elements combined with data

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,819
attributes is how we're going to start

00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:17,840
to create copies of our text and create

00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:21,180
layers in order to create the effects

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,219
and if you were to look at a hashed

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,440
email element with pseudo elements in

00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:28,860
the browser they kind of look like

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,720
yes the two we're going to use other

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,190
before and the after there are a bunch

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,500
of other ones but these are the only two

00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:37,140
that we need and when you combine them

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,910
with the h1 we get three layers and that

00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,610
doesn't sound like a lot but if you ever

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:46,850
had to use Photoshop without layers you

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:49,800
will know that like one one is enough so

00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,420
what we're going to do next is make sure

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,240
that our pseudo-element

00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:57,210
can use the data from our data attribute

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,850
and we do this in our CSS and it looks a

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,950
little bit like this so normally when we

00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,840
create a pseudo element in CSS we add a

00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,510
content property and it might have a

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,990
hard credit string or an empty value

00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:11,940
like blank or something like that

00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:16,470
what we what we're going to do is use a

00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:18,210
different CSS tool and make use of the

00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,520
CSS attribute function which is what

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,500
this is and then all we need to do is

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,780
pass in the name of our data attribute

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,790
and what that does is make the value of

00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,160
our data attribute the value of our

00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,810
content property so we don't have to

00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,570
start hard creating all this stuff into

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:36,060
our CSS we can just edit it in the HTML

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:40,650
instead which is a lot easier to work

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:44,550
with so with that in mind I'm going to

00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:46,530
show you an example this is a vertical

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:50,820
split layout they were really popular

00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:52,919
like three years ago but it's a really

00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,470
great example to use now this example

00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:58,050
I'm going to show you works back to ie 8

00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,370
so if you're sitting there going well

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,520
they're great but I can't use them

00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:06,870
because I have to support ie9 you can do

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:09,330
this one so the way that it works we set

00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:11,190
up my h1 we've got our data attribute

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:15,810
same text in our data attribute that's

00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:17,720
in our h1 that gives us some text then

00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:21,570
we set up a background gradient

00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,880
half-black and half-white it's split 50%

00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:28,590
down the middle and that is important so

00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:31,800
remember that then we edit our page 1

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:33,960
now I want the color of my h1 on the

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,539
black side of the page to be white so

00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,220
I'm going to set the color to white now

00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:41,070
because this works in i8

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:44,430
I do need to put a caveat on it it's

00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:47,010
single line only so we have this extra

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,710
property of white-space:nowrap

00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:52,230
just to make sure that it's not going a

00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,490
rap you don't have to put this in but

00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:57,450
it's not gonna work very well if you

00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:59,700
don't it's not really gonna give us what

00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,020
we want so now we need to add in our

00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,140
pseudo element and that's going to

00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:06,090
create our first layer of text now just

00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,790
like the earlier example we add our

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:10,410
content property with our CSS attribute

00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,720
function referencing our data attribute

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:15,240
and we're going to set a position to

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:19,200
absolute so that it sits on top of the

00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:21,230
text then I've added a left position of

00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,730
zero this just makes sure that it aligns

00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:26,040
sometimes it doesn't depending on how

00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:28,200
your page is set up so it's handy to

00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,360
have that in and then I'm gonna set the

00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,600
color to black and you can see that it

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,810
still doesn't really do what we want so

00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,630
there's one last step and all we're

00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:42,570
going to do is set a width to 50% and an

00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:45,540
overflow of hidden and we're done

00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:47,310
and it's editable and it's selectable

00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,830
and searchable and accessible via a

00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,470
screen reader and I think that's pretty

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:55,530
amazing like once you start doing this

00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:59,640
these are not new properties they can be

00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:01,370
used for many years now but we can start

00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,650
getting a little bit creative and

00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:06,510
creating fractured text this is too

00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:10,560
pseudo elements it's a bit of a masking

00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:13,860
situation you can create rainbow text or

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,140
beach text I am from Australia we have

00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,729
great beaches so this was like one of

00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,669
the first ones I made and I was really

00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:23,100
proud of it you can even start to

00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:26,520
recreate things that you might have seen

00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,950
in like Swiss design posters by like

00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:33,560
rotating and reflecting and transforming

00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:35,880
things and what I love about this is

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:40,020
this is all stuff that we do all the

00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:43,560
time with squares rectangles we can just

00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:46,500
do this with text as well and we can

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,630
take the new existing CSS that we're so

00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,030
familiar with and we can combine that

00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:55,600
with new things like blend modes

00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:57,670
now as I'm not a designer I'm not fully

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,910
across how all of the blend modes work I

00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,740
have a very loose understanding of them

00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:07,120
normally I just click through until it

00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:10,870
looks the way that I want yeah I'm sure

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,550
lots of you do the same thing but we can

00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,590
do some really really nice things with

00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:16,570
blend modes and because we can create

00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:19,360
those layers using the data attributes

00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:21,280
we can start putting different colors

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,500
and creating different kinds of effects

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,070
I'm a big Batman fan this is about man

00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,620
comic

00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:31,330
how'd you include it but blend modes

00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,790
there are a lot simpler to work with

00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,470
than the previous example so if I bring

00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:38,380
this this vertical split layer back up

00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:40,810
again and we were to use blend modes to

00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,730
create this effect when we set up our h1

00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:45,030
we don't need the data attribute we

00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:47,350
don't need to create copies of the text

00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:50,710
we do still create our background

00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:53,200
gradient exactly the same as before but

00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:55,000
when we go and set up our h1 really the

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,320
only thing that we need in order for

00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,220
this to work is a blend mode property

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,240
specifically the one we're going to use

00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:08,410
is called mix blend mode and a value of

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,720
difference and then we're done that's it

00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,070
I don't know like some of you are

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,960
probably sitting there going well why

00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:19,180
did you show me the first one and like

00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:22,120
browser support aside there are a few

00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:25,060
limitations to blend modes especially if

00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,680
you don't understand them like me and

00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,570
the limitation is there because we're

00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,030
blending colors the colors that you

00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:33,280
choose matter for the effect so if I

00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:37,890
wanted this to be my favorite color

00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,890
which is Rebecca purple and sky blue

00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:44,890
that's not quite what I wanted that's

00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:48,520
green and even if I change the blend

00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:51,550
mode the effect isn't like working the

00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,200
way that I want it to so you do have to

00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,120
keep that in mind with blend modes like

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,380
you you do need to understand the colors

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,030
that you're using in the layers that

00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,290
you're creating to make sure that it's

00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,450
going to give you the effect that you

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:03,550
want

00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:05,560
however the plus side of blend modes is

00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:08,170
that it is multi-line we don't have that

00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,180
limitation of single line text and I

00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,709
think that is really valuable and whilst

00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,080
you might not use it for this specific

00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:18,100
example it does allow you to do some

00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:20,140
really amazing things browser support is

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:24,070
OK

00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:26,380
ie is never going to support it so don't

00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:29,200
root for that but edge I believe is

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,270
working on it and Safari supports a

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,540
subset difference is one of them if you

00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:35,560
want to do that black and white effect

00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,420
but I hopefully will get this support

00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,730
soon this is actually the least

00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:42,550
supported property that I'm going to

00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:45,160
show you today so it's not too bad and

00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:47,650
if you want to have a play with it you

00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:50,050
can create some really nice beautiful

00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:52,660
things and because you're just blending

00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:58,660
layers you can blend them over anything

00:11:52,660 --> 00:12:01,120
like images video canvas other text and

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:04,270
you can get a little bit creative with

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,620
it I did sheet in this one this does use

00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,650
a little bit of JavaScript for the mouse

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:12,190
cursor but it's cool and I like it so I

00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:15,370
decide to leave it in and with effects

00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:19,750
like this one they're very common in

00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:21,970
print for for me

00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:24,010
I don't believe blood noids is the most

00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,870
effective way to create this effect what

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,580
I do love about it is that it even

00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:30,459
blends into the text shutter that I

00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:33,190
added onto the text so I think that is a

00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:34,480
really nice feature of blend modes when

00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:38,170
you're creating this kind of cut out

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,820
text but there's a better way to do this

00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,890
and that's the next thing I want to talk

00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:44,320
about which is background clear now

00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:46,600
background Clips probably my favorite

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,930
for making text effects I use it all the

00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,180
time and I don't know how well you can

00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,680
see but there's actually an animated

00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,410
background gradient going through the

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,470
text this is something that we get on

00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:00,730
the web that print doesn't have and I

00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,980
feel like we should embrace that

00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:06,730
obviously don't be offensive with your

00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:11,110
animations but you know be subtle with

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:14,620
it make the most of it so I'm gonna use

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:16,900
my trusty example again we set up a

00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,660
pitch one the same as the blend mode no

00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:21,040
attribute we don't need it we set up our

00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,690
background gradient half-black

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,420
half-white exactly the same as before

00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,770
the difference with background clip is

00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,200
that we're also going to add the

00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:32,650
background gradient onto our h1 but

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,990
we're going to invert the colors so that

00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,970
kind of gives us a black rectangle over

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:40,150
the white and a white rectangle over the

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:42,430
black and you can see on the black side

00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:45,490
that the text is sitting over that

00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:47,440
background gradient so what we need to

00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,480
do is use background clip to clip the

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,690
background away to just where the text

00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,760
is and we do that adding a property

00:13:52,690 --> 00:14:00,810
called background - clip with a value of

00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:04,510
text it's not really working

00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:07,839
that's because text by default has a

00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,910
fill color so if we want this to work we

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,820
need to get rid of that and there are a

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:16,120
couple of ways that you can do it the

00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:19,330
most obvious is adding a color property

00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:22,839
with a value of transparent and that

00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:24,580
works great the downside of course is if

00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:29,529
the browser doesn't support background

00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:31,810
clip your text won't be visible so you'd

00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:35,140
need to put a fallback in there's

00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,950
another option you can use which is text

00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,200
field color

00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:41,170
it's prefixed with the WebKit prefix but

00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:44,940
it does work in the major browsers and

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:47,170
that basically has the same support as

00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,910
background clip so a background clip is

00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:51,010
not supported text field colors not

00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,740
supported so it just Falls back to solid

00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:56,500
text and I do think it's important that

00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,000
you don't forget about older browsers

00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:02,040
and browsers that don't support all

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,080
these things like don't don't sacrifice

00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,550
accessibility for design like that's a

00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,070
terrible thing to do as fun as these

00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:12,459
things are we want to make sure people

00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:16,930
can read our content now I'm like blend

00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:18,520
modes background clip is amazing in that

00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,339
you can change the colors to whatever

00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,870
you want because you control that you're

00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:24,670
determining what the background is going

00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,230
to be so it doesn't matter what colors

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,570
you put in what images you put in the

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,810
background it's just going to clip it to

00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,959
whatever you've specified

00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:35,480
and much like the blend mode example

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,699
this is multi-line as well in my opinion

00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,519
background clips probably the better way

00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:42,680
to make this a factor of a blend modes

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,209
but they each have their different

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,430
purposes when you're creating a text

00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,689
effect and you can combine them to do

00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:51,670
more interesting things which I'll show

00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:54,139
a bit later supports also really good

00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:58,189
there's no reason in my opinion that you

00:15:54,139 --> 00:16:00,430
can't use this now there is some support

00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:04,160
issues in the default Android browsers

00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:05,600
and ie of course but there's no reason

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,660
that you can't put a fallback in to make

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,540
the voice of this effect and you can

00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:14,949
make some really cool things I like this

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:17,899
one I find it really relaxing it's like

00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:19,730
makes me feel comfortable and and chill

00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:22,220
or sometimes leave up on my computer at

00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:26,059
work or my other monitor other other

00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:28,699
monitor or you can create eighties tax

00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:32,329
you will notice that I love gradients so

00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:34,220
like they're everywhere this one that

00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:36,529
was a Photoshop tutorial that I just

00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,420
made in CSS instead of Photoshop I use

00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:42,170
the same text the same gradients the

00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:45,829
same text shadows if you into Disney

00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:49,370
like I am put your kid's name in or

00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:51,139
yours no judgments I put mine in this

00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:55,040
uses blend modes as well for the little

00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:57,949
like swushi bit and you might have

00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,589
noticed that I changed the fonts a lot

00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:02,360
in my text effects and that's because in

00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:05,209
my opinion fonts play a really important

00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,530
role in how these effects convey the

00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,439
meaning that you're trying to get across

00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:12,260
I don't know why I'll leave this one in

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:16,280
because it's really offensive but I

00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:18,649
don't know I'm attached to it this one's

00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,149
probably my favorite and I think it's a

00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:23,380
really good demonstration of how the

00:17:20,149 --> 00:17:25,640
font that you choose really impacts and

00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,649
accentuates how an effect is going to

00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,860
work this is a Google font I forget what

00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:32,360
it's called but it looks really amazing

00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,690
and all this is is a background gradient

00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:38,110
with background clip now speaking of

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,110
fonts

00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:43,590
I wanted to talk about them specifically

00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:45,930
and for text effects purposes I wanted

00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:48,000
to talk about layered fonts now layered

00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:50,100
fonts are special fonts that have been

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,700
made to be stacked on top of each other

00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,290
and they used a lot for print but you

00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,240
can use them on the web as well because

00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:59,670
we have our trusty pseudo-element data

00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:03,150
attribute trick so we can make the most

00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:05,490
of them in our CSS as well this one is

00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:09,330
called strata by Sophie Brown who is an

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:12,600
Australian font designer and there's a

00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:17,330
lot of options out there this one is

00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:20,100
festive letters I forget who makes it

00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:27,900
this one makes me think of The Simpsons

00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:30,480
I don't know why but it's cool and this

00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,340
one is called core circus it's by escort

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,130
and this is the example that I'm going

00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:38,550
to use we're gonna be the farewell to my

00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:42,770
split vertical layout and just go with

00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:48,540
some new stuff now so you're welcome now

00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:50,400
the way that we use laid fonts in CSS we

00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,110
do need to use our data attribute so

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,560
much like the very first example where

00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:58,050
I've got my h1 with my data attribute

00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:03,360
referencing the same taxi in the element

00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:05,520
as I've got in the attribute I'm just

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,350
gonna use them my font family laid fonts

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,170
work just like every other font

00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:12,300
it's called core circus the color

00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:17,880
doesn't matter but it's there it's like

00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:19,410
a coral or something the most important

00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,480
thing about layered fonts is setting up

00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,400
the Studer well of its so I'm going to

00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,010
use it before I'm gonna reference my

00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,320
content property with the CSS attribute

00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:31,100
function I'm setting my position to

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,500
absolute and I'm setting a color as well

00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:36,990
the key part about laid fonts is that

00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:41,250
rather than inheriting the font family

00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:43,590
from their h1 we're going to give it a

00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:47,250
new one in this case it's called core

00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:50,270
circus 2d dot one there are multiple

00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:57,290
dots I've gone with one

00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:59,450
and that gives us the laid effect now if

00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:01,330
you were paying attention you might have

00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:06,890
noticed that there was actually a shadow

00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:10,550
3d bit on this text this font actually

00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:12,590
comes with a 3d shadow I didn't use it

00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:15,260
and the reason that I didn't use it is

00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:17,380
because I'm already learning two fonts

00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:20,720
just for this effect in my website

00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:23,600
that's kind of a lot for what is that I

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,559
don't know eight letters I don't even

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:30,920
know what you want to do if you can

00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:33,080
recreate the effect in CSS you should

00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,970
like don't keep loading fonts in the

00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,340
page just to have a really pretty

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:39,050
shutter which I say now and I'm going to

00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:42,650
show an example where I just ignored

00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:47,000
that but the way that you create this is

00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:48,950
just using a CSS text shadow instead and

00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,510
you can kind of get the same effect

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,780
without overloading your website with

00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:58,840
fonts and they're heaps of fonts this is

00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:58,840
Yaqui it's binary typo it's two layers

00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:05,900
we also have this is call circus again

00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,190
this has so many text shadows on it like

00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,720
if you go and have a look it's just like

00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:11,330
text shadow text shadow texture

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,280
everywhere was really fun to make I made

00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:16,580
this during the West Australian state

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:19,850
election while I was at work making sure

00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:23,300
our website didn't break I was I was in

00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:27,380
a beanbag it was awesome this one is

00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:29,809
called Wonder it's by no very typo this

00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:32,960
is great for the think that called drop

00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:35,510
caps when you know you want that all

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,640
your worldy first letter you can use CSS

00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:40,700
first letter to do this I do this a lot

00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:43,460
just for fun this is the one that I

00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,530
violated my rule with it's called rigged

00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,850
shaded and it's by Jamie Clark and I

00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:52,520
think this font is incredible that

00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:55,670
shadow is so beautiful

00:21:52,520 --> 00:22:01,500
that I used five versions of his body to

00:21:55,670 --> 00:22:04,679
create this don't do that

00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:07,890
Wow it looks pretty great

00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:10,669
so that fonts on my fonts you should all

00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:13,950
go on by it because I think it's amazing

00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:15,510
now late fonts they're just one kind of

00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:20,010
font that you can use to create text

00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:22,169
effects if you follow me on Twitter you

00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:26,400
might have got a bit of a sense of the

00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:28,830
fact that I love variable fonts just a

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,010
little bit I already talked about them

00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:34,830
almost every day if you don't know what

00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:38,490
a variable font is it's a new open type

00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:42,510
spec for fonts which basically makes

00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:44,610
fonts like one font act like multiple

00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:49,230
fonts so where previously you might have

00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:52,740
had a bold a light a normal front way

00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:55,049
maybe wide and condensed version you can

00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:58,590
have all of this data in the one font

00:22:55,049 --> 00:23:01,890
file this obviously has performance

00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:05,039
benefits but it also has very exciting

00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:07,770
text effects benefits as well and the

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:10,620
reason for that is because when they

00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:13,080
define the data in the variable fund

00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:15,360
it creates an access so if we had a

00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,690
width that's a weight access for example

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,909
like this one you have your master

00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:25,380
weights like nine hundred four hundred

00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:28,289
two hundred but the font designer can

00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:31,530
interpolate these values so this one

00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:33,960
let's say starts at 100 and ends at 900

00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:36,120
not only do I have access to two hundred

00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:41,370
seven hundred nine hundred I have access

00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:43,860
to 101 102 103 all the way up to nine

00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:46,980
hundred and that means that I can

00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:51,480
animate the font way which is very

00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:55,500
exciting so before I show you my

00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,900
favorite text effect of all I'm going to

00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,630
show you the support because variable

00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,940
font support dropped in browsers in my

00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:04,820
opinion very quickly all the major

00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:09,120
browsers support them now you do need

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:10,350
high sierra on mac for firefox but you

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,059
can start having a play with this

00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,809
there's heaps of websites with fonts on

00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:17,519
access

00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:19,019
this is 1v - once is another and you can

00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,539
just start to have a play and use them

00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:23,669
for practical reasons or fun reasons

00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:27,980
like I'm going to show you so this

00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:30,990
example when I made it

00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:33,720
originally I'd done like a wait demo and

00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:37,080
it just like went from thin to too heavy

00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,029
and it was alright but everyone had done

00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,950
that and I was giving a presentation I

00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:42,779
said to my husband this isn't cool

00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:45,029
enough variable funds are so much more

00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:48,389
awesome than this I need to do something

00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:51,090
better and he hands me a cup of tea and

00:24:48,389 --> 00:24:54,600
he says it's okay you got this

00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:59,249
and I sat down I was watching I think it

00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:02,999
was no root Oh big into Naruto and I

00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:06,690
made this next example and you might

00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:11,070
have seen it on Twitter and when I made

00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:14,480
this I surprised myself hopes I turn to

00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:14,480
my husband look

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:22,879
and he goes yep that's great nothing no

00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:26,249
no no you don't understand

00:25:22,879 --> 00:25:30,299
this couldn't be done with text we

00:25:26,249 --> 00:25:33,330
needed SVG or JavaScript or canvas or

00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:35,360
something this is amazing he's like good

00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,360
job

00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:42,540
[Applause]

00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:44,370
so how do we make it so this one is

00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,470
called dacovia it's by David Burrell oh

00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:48,330
and it has so many things fun things to

00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:52,200
play with basically all of my demos use

00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:54,929
it and when we are referencing our h1 we

00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,880
just put our font family in of deco bar

00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:58,710
and the key difference here is that

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,929
we're going to make use of a new CSS

00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:03,960
property and it's called font -

00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:07,830
variation dust settings and this allows

00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:10,320
us to access custom access on a font so

00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:12,260
when the font designer creates the

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,030
variable fun and they create an access

00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:16,799
they assign it a code and it's a four

00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:19,980
character code and if it's a custom

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:22,890
access it's in uppercase if it's a named

00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:25,860
one like weight or slant or width it's

00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:27,720
in lowercase the true that I'm going to

00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:31,559
use for this effect are called inline

00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:36,200
and skeleton worm inline looks like this

00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:39,120
and its maximum value it's like a hitch

00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:42,179
skeleton worm looks like this

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:45,299
it's like Nobel's that's what I call

00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:46,799
them anyway and I noticed on the access

00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:48,290
practice website when I was playing with

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,809
all the little like slighty

00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:54,960
things that when you combined them they

00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:56,520
made points that looked like leaves this

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,320
was not intentional this is an

00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,270
interpolation error in the font but who

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,970
cares because it worked out really well

00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:06,780
and I thought well if I'm gonna create

00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:08,220
this effect what I need to do is animate

00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:11,429
it because I want it to look like it's

00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:14,250
growing so I just used a keyframe

00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:16,049
animation now the important thing to

00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:18,299
note about font variation settings in

00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:21,450
keyframe animations is you do need to

00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:24,120
reference every axis regardless of if

00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:26,490
you're resetting it or not if you don't

00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,890
it's kind of like transforms where you

00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:31,830
kind of just overwrite it so make sure

00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:34,169
that when you're referencing a keyframe

00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,700
and a font reaction settings in

00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:39,870
keyframes that you reference all the

00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:43,169
axis that you want to display now this

00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:45,900
is just using a four second

00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:49,030
infinite loop with linear easing not

00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:52,690
very fancy but it does create a real

00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:54,460
nice effect obviously I've added some

00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:57,010
other things in this uses background

00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:59,470
clip and text shadows to create that

00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:03,030
kind of depth but it's nothing that I

00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:05,560
haven't already shown you already and

00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:07,630
with variable fonts you can do heaps of

00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,210
really nice things this one is a great

00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:13,270
example because it shows how the effect

00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:15,220
is applied to the text itself so when

00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:18,190
you add a text shadow the text shadow

00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:20,080
disappears with the text as well and you

00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:23,200
can add things like blend modes onto

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:27,480
these to create weird things or you can

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,480
even get variable fonts that draw in

00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:34,690
much like we do with SVG s and I think

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,730
that is pretty amazing because all this

00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:40,120
is is a font and some text in your

00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:44,230
website and if none of that excites you

00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:47,260
at all you can even use it with things

00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:49,650
like CSS grid to convey more meaning in

00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:52,920
your content that you're putting online

00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:56,980
jello is the name of my dog if anyone is

00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:58,330
confused here's a golden retriever and I

00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:02,080
love him very much

00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:04,360
I miss him immensely so variable fonts

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,600
they go to offer practical benefits

00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:11,590
hugely but they're also giving us a lot

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:14,460
of creative opportunities and I've only

00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:17,880
really shown you like a couple of

00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:21,850
effects that you can do with a couple of

00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:24,900
CSS properties if you combine this with

00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:28,570
things like CSS grid or clip path or

00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:32,590
transforms or perspective gradients

00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:36,370
animations opacity you can start to

00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:39,670
create some really amazing things and we

00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:41,980
can start to make our designs driven by

00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:43,000
our content and our text rather than the

00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,830
other way around

00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,960
and we can start to create more

00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:51,460
meaningful and purposeful ways that our

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:54,400
text is being presented online in my

00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:56,860
opinion we need to stop thinking that

00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,830
something isn't possible with CSS or

00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:01,300
code in general we need to start asking

00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:05,130
ourselves

00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:08,110
can I do this not it can't do that

00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:10,540
because you don't really know what's

00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,730
possible with something until you've

00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:16,000
given it a go

00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:18,970
all of these examples are just text that

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,130
can be edited and changed and we need to

00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:25,900
forget about the limitations that we

00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:27,490
have put on our code this example was

00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:31,290
one of the first ones that I made

00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:34,360
it's made from a four destructure toriel

00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:36,730
and before I made it I would have

00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,970
confidently told you this could not be

00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:41,650
done in CSS but I now know three ways to

00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:46,780
make this using different combinations

00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:49,480
of CSS so what I'm hoping you get out of

00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:52,540
this is to embrace what CSS and other

00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,550
code has to offer us and that we start

00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:59,740
to create our designs in a way that best

00:30:54,550 --> 00:31:02,560
represents our content because the web

00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:05,050
is all about content and the way that we

00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:08,350
present it is how we convey meaning and

00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:11,830
the voice and the tone of that text and

00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:14,440
content and it's important that we

00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:17,710
consider how we interact with that

00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:20,170
content with our devices and in our

00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:24,280
different environments these ones are a

00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:29,440
cheat they do use JavaScript I love that

00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:31,560
one if we do this and we think about it

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,240
we think a little bit more creatively

00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:36,940
this is how we will transform the web

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,420
and our content to be more meaningful

00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:42,220
and to represent our knowledge and

00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:45,520
information in a way that print has been

00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:47,110
doing for a very long time but we can do

00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,780
it better because we can interact and

00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:52,240
animate and do all those sorts of things

00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,620
and take things to the next level so

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,990
what I want you to do is spend a little

00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,610
bit of time experimenting a little bit

00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,470
of time thinking about what can be done

00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:01,870
and less about what can't be done

00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:04,450
because you never know what you can do

00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:06,250
until you've given it a try and just

00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:09,410
because it's not been done before

00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:17,849
doesn't mean it's not possible thank you

00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:17,849
