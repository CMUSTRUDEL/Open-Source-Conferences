Title: "Everything You Know About Web Design Just Changed" by Jen Simmons — View Source 2018
Publication date: 2018-10-31
Playlist: View Source 2018 - London
Description: 
	2017 saw a sea change in web layout, one that few of us have truly come to grips with. We’re standing at the threshold of an entirely new era in digital design—one in which, rather than hacking layouts together, we can actually describe layouts directly. The benefits will touch everything from prototyping to custom art direction to responsive design. In this visionary talk, rooted in years of practical experience, Jen will show you how to understand what’s different, learn to think through multiple stages of flexibility, and let go of pixel constraints forever.

00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:11,639
so I'm here to talk about how everything

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:13,559
that you know about web design has just

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,199
changed if you're interested these

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,810
slides are right now up at no Descamps

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,939
slash Jen Simmons or I just apparently a

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,210
robot just tweeted the length for me and

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,310
my twitter accounts and what I mean by

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,519
that is that everything you know about

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,740
layout and graphic design has just

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,450
changed not user experience design not

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,430
all kinds of things about business the

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,930
business of getting your project right

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,550
for your customers but the thing is

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,890
about layout and about graphic design

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,469
that Hudgens is talking about and that

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,780
Mandy was talking about it's a new era

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,660
in CSS and the superpowers of what we

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,309
can do with CSS but I think for many of

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,809
us especially if you've been having a

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,430
professional career for the last five

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:55,140
years or you're aspiring to have a

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,390
professional career you may have the

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,850
impression that the way we've been doing

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,219
layout recently is the way that it's

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,210
always been done that this is just

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,670
you're just doing it the way it's

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,490
supposed to be right or maybe you do

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,659
have a sense that well a bunch of people

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,670
at work have been fighting about this

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,110
responsive or not responsive thing so I

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,490
guess there was a thing we used to do

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,990
and then we switched the responsive web

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,390
design responsive web designs the way to

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,570
do it that's correct now we've solved

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:24,119
this problem but the truth is that if

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,369
you've been around long enough you will

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,710
remember a bunch of different ideas that

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,750
we had about how to accomplish layout on

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,509
the web and all the struggles that we've

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,850
gone through and I think the reason

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,380
really we've been struggling it's

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:42,930
because there's been this tug of war

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:44,549
between two sides and one is wanting one

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,110
thing and ones wanting the other and we

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:47,610
can't really agree and we're just

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,579
someone sitting in the criticize of the

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,549
sandbox crying saying we need more art

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,840
we need real graphic design this we it

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:56,490
should be beautiful look at the

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,200
magazine's look at the filmmaking look

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,020
at the sculpture like we why don't we

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,700
have more artistic merit on the web and

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,560
then on the other hand we've had these

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,240
folks grabbing saying no but that's not

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,310
how the web works you need to have

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,869
beautiful code you need to lean into the

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,030
medium you need to stay within the

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,230
constraints of the medium no don't send

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,300
that to me in a PD

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:19,260
I can't make that why don't you

00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,150
understand how the web works so we've

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,760
had these attempts over the years we've

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,400
tried over and over again to solve page

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,040
layouts on the web we started with

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,640
simple HTML that's how it all started

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,459
back in the day this is what we had

00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,620
simple layouts I have there you can see

00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,420
a headline there's an invisible box

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,190
around that headline any of the browser

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,440
engineers in the room people who make a

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,390
browser for a living know this that

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,640
everything is a box whether it looks

00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,290
like it is or not and you can I'm going

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,700
to add a paragraph and you can then see

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:55,500
like how those two boxes are reflowing

00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,000
when the browser is narrower that when

00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,370
the viewport is narrower the text

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,739
reflows and it gets taller things could

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,690
have automatically grow and shrink in

00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:07,260
order to fit the content that's there

00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:09,150
and the image drop the image in images

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,790
back in the day were the size that you

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,470
made them in Photoshop or fireworks or

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,390
wherever you were making images it's

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,569
just sitting there on the page at its

00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:20,400
intrinsic size we've got overflow right

00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:24,840
I think the layout is the history of

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,450
struggling with overflow but this is

00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,340
flow layout this idea that things will

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,780
like if there's another paragraph that

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,549
gets inserted if somebody comes along

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,889
and changes the content and they erase a

00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:37,650
paragraph that things will get taller or

00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:39,329
shorter and just readjust and read igell

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,150
themselves they don't start to overlap

00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:44,310
they rejigger this is a concept pub flow

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,959
layout we've never really called it that

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:50,280
because we never really needed a name

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,840
for it but now that I think that it's

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,370
almost like we've been fish swimming

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,780
around in water and we didn't know it

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,849
was called water and now we're growing

00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,500
legs and getting out on land and as we

00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:00,209
talk about things like CSS grid and we

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,440
defined what land is we also need to

00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:06,239
define what water is slowly out it let

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,519
you do these kinds of layouts and so

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,260
websites look like this we could censor

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,790
images we could put things next to each

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,230
other we could Center text we could

00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,239
change the color of the background if we

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:20,729
stayed within the 216 colors that were

00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:22,800
available we also had tables not tables

00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:24,870
in HTML are really awesome when you have

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,850
tabular data if you have to have bailer

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,710
data please use a table

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,990
please use a table do not get confused

00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:34,830
by the fact that lots of people say do

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:36,780
not use tables for layout what happens

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,580
is a lot of designers wanted to do

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,080
something interesting with their layouts

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,540
there were no other tools and they

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,760
realized oh gosh if I put some text in

00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,170
that tab you'll sell it but some images

00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,360
in those table cells and make the lines

00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:51,330
go away I can start to create a layout

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,390
and the era of tables for layout was

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:57,000
born and this era went along how many

00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:01,110
people here did a table based layout and

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,050
right many of you the good thing about

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:07,110
this era is that we had some amazing

00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,900
beautiful graphic design it was the 90s

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,170
we rocked our pixels we did all kinds of

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,360
crazy stuff we brought in ideas from

00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:17,600
hypertext and the cd-rom era and we sort

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,550
of got creative about what was possible

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,380
for those of you who weren't there what

00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,150
we were doing any time we had some sort

00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,890
of an image lots of times like here on

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,680
this example there's two paragraphs of

00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,660
text and we have one of them over on the

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,840
left and one of them over on the right

00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,970
and so to get that card layout you'd go

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,100
into a program like fireworks or others

00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,960
and you chop your images up into lots of

00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,760
different puzzle pieces and you'd very

00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,900
carefully piece them back together again

00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:47,280
in Dreamweaver and pray here the table

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,780
borders are turned back on so you can

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,310
see the lines and you can see the

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,570
separation between the puzzle pieces but

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,460
of course you would make your table

00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:57,200
borders be 0 and then all of that stuff

00:05:53,460 --> 00:06:00,420
would disappear this became velh process

00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:03,000
go into Photoshop and draw what you want

00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,100
everything to look like code it by any

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,830
means necessary doesn't matter how evil

00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,150
your code is and on the other side on

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,490
the other end you hopefully get out a

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,950
good website a good website the website

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,440
that you wanted sometimes I almost feel

00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:18,270
like we're back to this era of by any

00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,980
means necessary it's ok if the code

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:23,370
looks like crap when I look at like I

00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:27,660
don't know react with CSS inline Styles

00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:29,310
stuff but we won't talk about that one

00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,200
of the big problems of this era is that

00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,810
there was a drastic lack of

00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,040
interoperability between web browsers so

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,720
the people at Netscape kind of did what

00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,830
they wanted and the people at IE kind of

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,360
did what they wanted and those two

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,030
browsers did not do the same thing with

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,680
the same code

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,820
and so we ended up stuck in this world

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,100
where you had to basically make two

00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,150
websites with different code and then or

00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,800
if you couldn't didn't have the budget

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,120
for it then you just put a banner on

00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,460
your website that said this site only

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:57,120
works in Netscape 3 too bad for you

00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:59,470
so we tried again that was tricky hard

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,560
annoying too many puzzle pieces so we

00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,120
tried again with flash and this was a

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,610
big I mean how many of you made flash

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,230
websites all flash not just flash for as

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,270
or flash for videos but like the entire

00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,710
website was in flash this is how it

00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,380
worked it had a completely different

00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:16,390
mental model it was much more like going

00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:19,510
into something like sketch are going

00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:21,400
into well a macro media director or even

00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:23,320
almost more like Final Cut Pro or

00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,120
something and laying out your content

00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,280
one of the very first question you had

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,120
to answer when the program opened up and

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,850
you were making a new movie was how big

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,010
do you want your movie stage to be and

00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,570
you define that in pixels and then you

00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:41,260
had this timeline and everything was

00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:43,600
laid out on this timeline for layout the

00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:46,210
mental model of flash was the mental

00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:49,690
model of the GUI of the computer that

00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:52,090
had amounts where something like a box

00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:54,160
was on the page at a certain number of

00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,780
pixels from the top a certain number of

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,370
pixels from the left the box was a

00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,110
certain number of pixels in each

00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:02,320
dimension that's how the computer

00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:04,210
thought about that layout or it also is

00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,370
the same kind of mental model of the

00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:09,520
real world if you are doing paced up and

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:11,380
you want to Center some text it's your

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,270
job to make sure that it's centered with

00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,890
your ruler and straight with your

00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:18,300
drafting table and if you accomplish

00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:20,979
that then hey you've accomplished that

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,590
everything in flash every bit of text

00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:25,930
every box every like headline every

00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:27,820
paragraph was a separate object and you

00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,110
handled those objects and as a developer

00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,850
you were responsible for making sure

00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,260
that you programmed in where all of

00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:35,409
those objects were gonna be at any given

00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,700
time in this fixed size box if you

00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:38,789
wanted scrollbars you had to make your

00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,080
own scroll bars which is a terrible idea

00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:42,719
[Music]

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,430
do not make your own scrollbars it also

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,459
meant that this box was just kind of

00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:49,410
stuck on the webpage the web page the

00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:52,470
HTML just became sort of a container for

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:54,149
holding up blocks of mystery and the web

00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,680
page the web technology that browser

00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:57,720
didn't have any idea what was inside of

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,000
the box of mystery which meant neither

00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,850
did any sort of search engine robot or

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,350
any kind of accessibility device these

00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,550
is a terrible none of these sites would

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,110
show up on Google none of these sites

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,540
were accessible it also meant that if

00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,399
you were a person editing content it was

00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,110
very hard to edit the content because

00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:14,940
you had to go like backing in the movie

00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,290
and change all of the text and all of

00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:20,310
the objects and change the layout in

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:22,320
order to like make a new blog post so we

00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,760
stopped doing that but also the browser

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,110
window when the viewport got bigger

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,640
there was no way for the viewport the

00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:30,720
two regional the layout the layout

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,810
wasn't actually part of the web so we

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,209
tried again and we said okay we got to

00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,370
go back to its the web we can't just

00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:40,890
have any art by any means necessary we

00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:43,380
need to respect the medium let's figure

00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:46,980
out how to do this properly and Along

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:51,270
Came CSS especially once it was usable

00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:53,130
in real browsers here's a page from

00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,959
Jeffrey zelmans designing with web

00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,020
standards from 2003 where he shows out

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,490
he's very clearly articulates look this

00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:01,350
crappy code is not a good idea it's

00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:05,399
really painful look at what you can do

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:09,720
instead in your HTML just write semantic

00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:11,850
tags around your content it's easy it's

00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,149
not easy but it's elegant it's there's

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,529
like a purity to this way of coding

00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:18,810
images rather than taking your picture

00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:21,089
of a dog and chopping it up into four

00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:24,120
pieces and reassembling it in the table

00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:28,230
you would just have a picture of a dog I

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,880
remember how like elegant that really

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,860
felt is someone building websites that

00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,000
it wasn't nearly as complicated that

00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,800
there was something about the purity of

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,779
the code and the way that it represented

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,750
the actual content that just made life

00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:42,300
so much easier one of the lessons from

00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,430
this era that we carry with us to today

00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,010
and that we still need to value today is

00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:49,260
the advantages of using semantic markup

00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:51,510
and what we get from using semantic

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,790
markup and also the principle of the

00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:56,010
separation of concerns where HTML

00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,690
is about the content and representing

00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,270
the content it's about creating the

00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,340
interface with forms and buttons using

00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:04,800
real button elements and real form

00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,780
fields that that's good and when the h

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,910
the CSS falls off because someone's

00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:11,430
using reader mode or someone has saved

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,260
it in some sort of like instapaper or

00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,820
pocket or some kind of program that it's

00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,950
fine they can read the content they can

00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,710
do what they're supposed to do and then

00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,750
CSS will handle the visual look and the

00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:24,330
layout fingers-crossed

00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,100
comes eventually and javascript of

00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,960
course came along later for behavior for

00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,000
fancy you're kind of lazy logging for

00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,520
fancier sort of interfaces and inform

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,780
elements but this idea of separating the

00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,700
concerns and having a stack of

00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:39,060
technology being a better solution is

00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:42,870
something that stays with us today so

00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:45,480
how are we going to do layout in CSS the

00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:48,090
original plan was to use absolute

00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,520
positioning and absolute positioning has

00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:52,410
the same mental model as the GUI you

00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,360
would take something an element and

00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,890
absolutely position it and measure how

00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,870
much from the top and how much from the

00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,310
left you're gonna have it be you're

00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,080
gonna tell everybody how big it's gonna

00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:03,180
be and that's what you get

00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,140
the problem with absolute positioning

00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,700
though and there's nothing wrong with

00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,470
using it there's plenty of use cases

00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,570
today that we use it for usually for

00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:12,420
little things like a little new banner

00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:15,360
where the word new is always the word

00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,710
new you know how big it is it's easy to

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,750
handle but if you're trying to

00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,070
absolutely absolutely position a

00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,660
paragraph and then you want to

00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,550
absolutely position another paragraph

00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,100
underneath but you have no idea how tall

00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,870
or why you absolutely positioning things

00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,540
gets rid of the flow and you get rid of

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:33,090
the advantage of the flow so it turns

00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,640
out it's a terrible way to do layout of

00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:37,800
the whole entire page to try to position

00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,450
everything every box on the page then

00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,800
the developer is responsible to position

00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:44,130
every box on the page

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,510
Burke Boston how kamli the - - of the

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:51,600
people who wrote the CSS 1 specification

00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:53,700
they spoke at CSS day into 2017 and

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,100
someone from the audience asked them is

00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,450
there anything that you think you like

00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,610
shouldn't have done that you shouldn't

00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:02,700
have put into CSS at all and how come

00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:07,520
Lee the father of CSS said very

00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,520
sheepishly maybe absolute position

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,610
so here it is on the timeline poor

00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:16,060
little apps pause trying to be our

00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:17,950
layout system but it just didn't work so

00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,950
what did we do we figured out some hacks

00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:24,579
and we started using floats and doing

00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:27,459
fluid layouts so floats also floats are

00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:29,470
awesome floats were designed to do this

00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:31,420
you take an image you float it to the

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:34,540
left you let the rest of the flow

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,250
content flow around the floated object

00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,100
that's cool we should do that today

00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:40,839
throw a little shape on there and shape

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,370
outside and you can flow it in a shape

00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,910
that's not a square or rectangle that's

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:47,350
cool but this is what we did in the

00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,630
beginning of layout where we would take

00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,579
say the first two elements and wrap them

00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,870
in some sort of wrapper like a div and

00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:54,970
pick the rest of the content and wrap it

00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,920
in another div will float that first

00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,600
rapper to the left will float the second

00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,959
rapper to the right will give both of

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:06,250
them maybe a width of 45% because God

00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:09,140
forbid you get anywhere near 100% total

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:13,130
and just leave this gap in the middle

00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:14,540
and pray but you saw just a moment ago

00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,280
there was an image the image was its

00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,410
fixed size you know this is back at the

00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,450
beginning of float space floated based

00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:22,430
layouts fluid layouts like we had these

00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:25,130
problems with like overflow and whatever

00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:27,530
but we just tried our best

00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:29,450
here's another so but there's the the

00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,860
the concept that comes from this error

00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,510
that we still carry with us today that

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,370
we've still been using quite a lot up

00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,530
into the last few years is this idea of

00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,150
having fluid columns that there's

00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:40,460
something cool about having fluid

00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:43,850
columns and we should hey we should we

00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:45,470
want that here's another example of more

00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,240
of a blog layout that we had quite a bit

00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,860
and lots of people love fluid layout

00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,300
because it felt like it was of the web

00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,370
and it was a good idea it was of the

00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,300
medium but a lot of other people didn't

00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,910
because you had this kind of awkward

00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:58,100
space on the right and the line length

00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:02,150
of the text would get far too long and

00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:03,440
typographers were like no and here in

00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,990
order to make sure the image never

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,490
overflows the sidebar if it needs to

00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,230
make the image even smaller and just

00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,380
pretend that everybody's monitor is at

00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:14,630
least 800 pixels wide and then you have

00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,400
an even bigger awkward white space I was

00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,810
never really a fan personally a fluid

00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,600
web design because I didn't like these

00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:22,550
things but this was a major movement in

00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,760
the history of layout in our attempts to

00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:27,380
do layouts we kept back however did this

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,180
battle of some people saying it's the

00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:33,790
web fluid is best and some people saying

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,790
but we need art ugly is ugly

00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:39,940
so we get to this place of fixed-width

00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:42,310
layouts using floats right where we say

00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:45,070
I'm gonna fix those boxes I'm not gonna

00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:46,840
let them be fluid that way I never have

00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,460
awkward weird space next to my image

00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,530
that way I can make the line length of

00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:52,810
the text be whatever I want it to be and

00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:54,760
instead what we end up with is the whole

00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:57,160
layout of all that content is kind of

00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,050
fixed within itself and all of it

00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,700
overflows so when the page is bigger

00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,410
than the size we thought it was going to

00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,350
be you just kind of have giant amounts

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:07,030
of overflow but it didn't look broken

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,490
and that's what was important especially

00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:14,170
to say like bosses and people at

00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:17,140
advertising agencies in this era the era

00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:19,720
of fixed with floats we also there was

00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:21,990
chaos I remember working on a team of

00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,670
about a hundred people in a financial

00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,830
institution in lower Manhattan and

00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:30,490
everybody kept sending PDFs that were

00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:32,770
like eight or three or nine pixels off

00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,420
of other people's PDFs and insisting

00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:36,580
that everything be pixel perfect to

00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,090
their PDF it's like every page is it

00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:41,620
different

00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:44,290
so 960 grid was a way to say hey memo

00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,360
everyone must use the 960 grid PDF

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:48,430
template here's your autograph a file

00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,320
here's your Visio file please let's have

00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:52,600
a standard like the idea of having a

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,610
design standard of standardizing a team

00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,870
on a certain system is a good idea

00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,340
that's something that a lot of folks are

00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,170
talking about today how do we have a

00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,440
design system how do we make it custom

00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:04,360
for our own brand but kind of what ended

00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,650
up happening is 960 and the things that

00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,390
came before it and the things that came

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,550
after it standardized in the industry

00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:12,160
this idea that you should always use 12

00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,990
columns that every column should be 60

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,030
pixels wide every gutter should be 20

00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,010
pixels wide like nine is easily

00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:20,560
divisible by two six three and four so

00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:24,040
therefore it's best God has ordained us

00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,810
used to use the 12 column layout and we

00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,089
ended up with this kind of world where

00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,770
we see a lot of the same things over and

00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:32,250
over again user experience design became

00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:35,560
draw wire friends that look like this

00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,970
but in those days we did discover and

00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,610
we've since force ourselves to forget

00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:41,710
but I think we should remember when it's

00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:43,450
a good idea to have fixed size content

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,420
sometimes it actually works out really

00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:48,910
well to have something an imager

00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:51,220
thinking it's just a fixed-size maybe

00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:52,660
even the ads that come from the IEP regs

00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,730
and are gonna be fixed no matter what

00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:57,060
you do we have fixed size content in our

00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:01,360
world we've been trying to pretend but

00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:03,880
so here we go fixed another era on the

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,420
timeline and we probably all know what

00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:10,630
comes next after fixed responsive web

00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:12,340
design Ethan Marcotte in 2010 coined

00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,560
this term responsive web design and he

00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:17,830
defined it as a flexible grid to go back

00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:20,260
to flexible columns flexible images and

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,550
media queries you combine those three

00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,170
things together and you end up with

00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,610
responsive web design and that's the air

00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,490
that we've been in for a while it's

00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:28,840
actually sort of the longest box on this

00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,490
timeline we've kind of been in the

00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,650
responsive era longer than we've been in

00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:36,490
any of those previous eras so you know

00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:37,900
maybe maybe it won't last forever here

00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,580
is what that example looks like in a

00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,890
responsive design where the image has a

00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,660
width of a hundred percent set on it so

00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,850
that it always is a hundred percent of

00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:48,130
its containing block that way when the

00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,840
container gets smaller it gets smaller

00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,850
when the container gets bigger it gets

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,190
bigger and then that sidebar of course

00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:56,050
we can add a breakpoint a media query to

00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:58,060
say hey when things are like at below

00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:00,700
this number I happen to know that

00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:02,440
they're gonna get weird me the humans

00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,910
I'm gonna say don't lay out like that

00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,560
switch it and put it down underneath

00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,480
fluid images and media media queries

00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,580
these are the two big ideas that landed

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,380
in the industry in the era of responsive

00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,090
web design that have stuck with us that

00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,500
are still really good ideas even as we

00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:20,440
change our techniques and we don't use

00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,300
floats and we don't use percents having

00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,250
fluid images having fluid things like

00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,970
video using media queries when necessary

00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:28,630
are things that in our toolbox

00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,760
unfortunately I mean I think it's

00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:32,770
unfortunately that kind of wireframe

00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,240
folks were very I think overwhelmed

00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,340
about knowing what responsive layouts

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,700
would look like and so therefore we kind

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:42,100
of entered the eight years of this right

00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,660
we got twelve comps eight comms four

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,400
columns or maybe two columns and that's

00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,080
awesome and get the desktop layout the

00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,610
tablet layout the mobile layout I'm done

00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:53,080
I emailed you the PDF I'm done I don't

00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:56,190
want to talk to you in our designs kind

00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,190
of I'll end up looking like this

00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:04,450
how many people have built this website

00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:07,600
right how many people are sick of

00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:10,210
looking at this website it looked really

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,870
beautiful when it was new that was a

00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:16,120
long time ago we don't have to stay

00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:19,360
stuck in those that that layout because

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,760
we have now all of this CSS all of these

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,740
things really weren't a thing when a

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,900
responsive web design started there's a

00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,160
whole bunch of properties I'm only going

00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,350
to be able to have time to talk about a

00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,910
few but others today have talked about

00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,780
others and there's learning out there

00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:34,540
about them

00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:36,340
these are awesome these is the new

00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,230
toolkit that we have and we're going to

00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,540
be using these tools along with all of

00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:42,670
this CSS that we've had for a long time

00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,370
and we're gonna keep using floats to do

00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:47,020
floats we're gonna keep using margins

00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,570
maybe occasionally even a negative

00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:52,050
margin we are gonna combine all of these

00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:54,700
things to create amazing layouts the

00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:58,600
four major things that we're gonna use

00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:02,410
are flow layout CSS grid multi-column

00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:05,800
and flexbox and flow today I'm sort of

00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:07,450
always talking about the horizontal tbh

00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,810
writing mode which is how English works

00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:13,060
it goes left to right along a horizontal

00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,710
line but hoiding I was just talking

00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,660
about you can also change the writing

00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:19,210
mode so that your text flows along a

00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,220
vertical line or your text can flow from

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,590
right to left just to keep your brains

00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:26,800
from completely exploding I'm staying in

00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,420
the horizontal TV left-to-right writing

00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,280
mode but writing mods are important and

00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,540
they can be used as she showed you for

00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,210
all kinds of text effects that are

00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,100
really kind of awesome but here's an

00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,650
example of how these four things are

00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,540
gonna be combined I and Rachel Andrew

00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,970
and others we're constantly getting this

00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,490
question of which one should I use now

00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:48,040
fluxbox our grid the grid replace flex

00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:51,670
box flex box must be terrible now we

00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,920
have grid I get it because people are

00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:56,080
thinking like should I use bootstrap or

00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,790
foundation which one's better I'm not

00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,620
gonna use both I used to use foundation

00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:02,710
I'm now i'm gonna use bootstrap or vice

00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:04,780
versa but flex box and grade are not two

00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:08,679
separate frameworks they're two pieces

00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:11,049
of CSS CSS the native frame

00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:12,759
work if you will of web layout and

00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:14,110
you're gonna use both of them they do

00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:15,309
different things and they both are

00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,139
awesome and you should use them for

00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:18,850
different things so here's an example

00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:21,940
like maybe we have this card we have a

00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:23,409
teaser card with some content on it and

00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,210
we decided we're gonna lay out the

00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:27,519
internal structure of that teaser card

00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:29,919
using flexbox perhaps because we have a

00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:32,350
lot of variations of that card and we

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,119
want to have flexbox use the ability of

00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,220
flexbox to do some interesting layouts

00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,330
so we have one little bit of CSS that

00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,950
just kind of handles a whole bunch of

00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,809
different layouts depending on which

00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:43,539
kind of content is in that particular

00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:46,059
instance of the teaser but then we'll

00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:47,619
lay out the whole set of teasers using

00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:50,110
CSS great because that's the kind of

00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:52,389
thing that greed really likes to do now

00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:54,639
maybe we have a sort of sidebar we ish

00:22:52,389 --> 00:22:56,049
stuff over there on the side but we

00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,190
don't we just have this image we don't

00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:58,419
really need to do much with it but

00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,369
underneath the image we've got like a

00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:02,139
whole bunch of little things and maybe

00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:03,999
multi-column is the perfect tool for

00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:05,860
laying that out in a way that's gonna

00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:08,049
make sense and then we're gonna take

00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,610
those two things the image and the multi

00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:11,409
cone things and we need to lay them out

00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,299
together but we don't actually have to

00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:14,830
do anything because they're just gonna

00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:17,230
hang out together inside there

00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,700
containing block with a flow layout and

00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,320
flow is the default if you do nothing

00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,210
else you get flow so there they are in a

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,279
little flow layout but maybe that

00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:26,049
sidebar thing and the bigger teaser card

00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,889
layout we need to lay those two things

00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:28,899
out together

00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:31,179
so we'll make the containing box of

00:23:28,899 --> 00:23:33,549
those two things have display grid on it

00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:35,559
and create a grid layout a grid

00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:36,610
formatting context for those that

00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:40,119
container

00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:41,710
it's a bunch of nested containers then

00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,549
we've got some navigation up on the top

00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:45,100
you know what

00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:46,529
navigation and flexbox are in love with

00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,850
each other that go along really well

00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:51,100
we're just gonna go with that and then

00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:52,360
the whole outer container the page we're

00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,950
just gonna have slow layout there's not

00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,470
really anything else that we need to do

00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:58,659
so that's how these things work together

00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:01,149
and as you learn what each one of them

00:23:58,659 --> 00:24:02,740
does whether you're a front-end

00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:04,539
developer who's writing CSS and writing

00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,009
code or whether you're not maybe here a

00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:07,600
person who's literally never going to

00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:09,639
write a line of code in your life you're

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,009
a designer and you want to be able to

00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:13,509
understand how to ask for what you want

00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:15,129
and someone else can write the code or

00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:16,720
you are some kind of stakeholder you're

00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:17,980
a client you're a Content person and

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,299
you're in meetings where you want to

00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,250
have some say and what happens in the

00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:23,290
design too you can start to learn

00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,970
oh there's different tools and they have

00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,530
different sorts of ways in which they

00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,540
work maybe you don't always remember

00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,920
which is which but you know to start to

00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:31,240
ask for the kinds of things you want

00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,060
because you understand that these are

00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,100
the things that are possible so today

00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:38,530
I'm going to talk about CSS grid

00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,690
especially CSS grid is the super power

00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:42,490
that we have it's the most exciting

00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:45,430
thing it's kind of the thing that makes

00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:47,470
the huge change happen the most and as I

00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:49,840
was learning CSS grid 2 years ago when I

00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:53,800
was making example after example my

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:57,280
first thought was it's responsive web

00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,960
design now more better I'm doing

00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,460
responsive layouts I'm doing responsive

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,140
web design it's just far easier to write

00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,120
this code this code is elegant it's not

00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:06,580
awful it's easy it's not this crappy

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,560
flow based stuff but the deeper and

00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,570
deeper I got and the more I understood

00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:14,740
what grid actually wants to do I

00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:17,380
realized oh we're in a new era of layout

00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:18,880
this is not responsive web design now

00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,150
more better this is actually something

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:25,120
different and I believe that in a large

00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:28,660
part because the dynamic of this fight

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:31,090
has changed where instead of us being in

00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,470
the it's the web era of responsive web

00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:36,190
design which is what we've been doing

00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:38,170
for the last eight years or the oh we

00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,150
need art but our code is gonna be crap

00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,290
this dynamic has actually totally

00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:44,950
changed with the tools that we have

00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:46,300
today so I think it's helpful to have a

00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,680
name I think it's helpful for these

00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,270
errors to be named you can go into

00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,250
meetings and say we're not doing tables

00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:52,990
for layout anymore we're gonna do slope

00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,040
based layout oh we're not doing fixed

00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,300
width layout anymore we're doing

00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,090
responsive web design and those things

00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,320
mean something so over the winter I was

00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:03,040
really trying to figure out like what

00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:05,460
could be a good name and I'm can sayin

00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:09,220
I'm proposing that we call this new era

00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:11,830
intrinsic web design an intrinsic

00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:15,460
meaning it's belonging to or the

00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:19,420
intention or constitution of a thing its

00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:21,670
intrinsic to the web it's also the name

00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:25,120
of one of the CSS modules it's a word

00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:27,040
that's used in one of the CSS modules

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,260
one of the CSS specifications called the

00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,540
intrinsic and extrinsic sizing principle

00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,700
and as we are fish learning to walk on

00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,750
land and we learn about water some of

00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,570
the stuff we're learning about it

00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:39,430
sizing and overflow and things that have

00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:41,380
been around for a while and this concept

00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:44,890
of intrinsic and extrinsic sizing it's

00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:46,390
just kind of in the air so I want to

00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:48,220
talk to you about the new reality of

00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:50,740
intrinsic web design and really from the

00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,350
point of view from design of design

00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:55,480
there's a lot to learn around the code

00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:57,250
but I'm more fascinated by what this

00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,930
means for the medium and how the medium

00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,610
is different and the kinds of designs

00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:03,040
that we can do are different because of

00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:05,260
the tools that we have so I'm going to

00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,950
talk about three things a contracting

00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:11,950
and expanding flexibility and about the

00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:14,620
viewport itself so first ways to

00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:16,750
contract and expand the space if you

00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,550
think about what it means to have a

00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:20,140
viewport and did have a layout that

00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:22,120
changes so that when the viewport is

00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:24,070
smaller on phones and bigger on big

00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,380
screens really what we're doing is we're

00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:29,620
figuring out how do we contract and how

00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:33,850
do we expand our design into the

00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:35,470
available space so far we've been doing

00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:39,070
two things we've been doing wrap and

00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:41,890
reflow so here's text being wrapped and

00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:44,260
re flowing as it gets narrower things

00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:46,510
wrap they get they reflow as there's

00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:48,850
more space or with images

00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:50,920
it's that technically work this way but

00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,450
the effect to the for the point of view

00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,520
of the user or the point of view of the

00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:56,140
design itself is that we've got the

00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,600
image is reflowing

00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:00,820
they've been moving around so that you

00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,650
have fewer of them as there's less space

00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:04,900
in the width direction and more of them

00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:07,180
as there's more space and we've been

00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:09,880
combining those things right so here's

00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,680
cards teaser cards same idea wrapping

00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,180
and re flowing that's one of the things

00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,900
that we can do and one of the things we

00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:20,200
have been doing another is enlarging and

00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:21,730
shrinking so you can make things smaller

00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,260
those images are actually getting

00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:25,030
smaller they fit because they're getting

00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:27,610
smaller or you can enlarge they get

00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:29,980
bigger when there's more space or on

00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:32,200
text if you text size text and viewport

00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,060
units you can get viewport unit size

00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,560
text to get smaller when the viewer is

00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,090
less space in the viewport or bigger

00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:40,630
when there's more space in the viewport

00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:45,100
or about to happen happening in the

00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:46,390
moment now is variable fonts where you

00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,800
can have a variable font it's actually

00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,840
narrower instead of being

00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,760
smaller in the font-size dimension it

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,070
just stays the same font size but it

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,830
gets narrower it gets wider in order to

00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:59,320
take up space or contract into space and

00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:02,980
a lot of what responsive web design has

00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:06,130
been is oh there's the teaser cards no

00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:08,110
there's a that's the combination so it's

00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:10,120
a lot of like combining those two things

00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:11,860
together so some of the things are

00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,840
shrinking and some of them are reef

00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,430
lowing and the cards are shrinking and

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,570
then the cards are reef lowing so

00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,130
everything we know about responsive web

00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:19,990
design has really been a combination of

00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:22,630
these two things shrinking and growing

00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:25,900
and reef lowing in order to get smaller

00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:28,450
or get bigger but we now have two more

00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,550
massive principles two more ways that we

00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:32,980
can take up space or shrink when we need

00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,900
to in order to get our design to adapt

00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,570
and fit on the screens we have one of

00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,610
them is to add or remove whitespace so

00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:42,370
the item the content might stay the same

00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:44,440
size but you add white space around it

00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,720
or you remove white space around it in

00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,610
order to make your layout work and as

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,560
I've said this out in the world over the

00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:51,850
last year I get some pushback where

00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,020
people are saying well we've always had

00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:55,030
white space we've always had the ability

00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,830
to make lots of white space or get rid

00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:58,300
of white space but I think what people

00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:01,020
are thinking of from the past is the

00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:03,310
ability to add margins or add padding

00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,470
maybe to make the margins be set or

00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:06,700
padding be set in percents to change the

00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,830
amount of margins and padding around

00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,080
certain breakpoints but it's been a very

00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:12,730
rudimentary way to handle white space

00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,830
and it really hasn't given us beautiful

00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:18,280
or elegant or foolproof ways to do white

00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:20,230
space the way that we have now now with

00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,970
I mean starting with flexbox being able

00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:24,850
to do vertical centering oh my god

00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,230
vertical centering there's all kinds of

00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:29,290
ways that we can actually add and remove

00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:30,940
white space and keep a layout looking

00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:33,070
really beautiful a lot of it comes from

00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:35,140
grid where you can lay things out using

00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:37,270
grid you can have a row in grid that's

00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:40,000
completely empty and sort of disappears

00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:41,290
or appears here's an example where I'm

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,630
kind of doing that it changes at

00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:46,420
different break points but also it's all

00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:48,370
about the white space the empty space is

00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,960
it beautiful does it look good these are

00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:52,210
the things that graphic designers were

00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,400
obsessed with in the early 20th century

00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:56,140
and that it's carried graphic design all

00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,410
the way through the last hundred years

00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:00,940
or so more that's what great graphic

00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,660
design is built on it's beautiful white

00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,220
space we

00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:06,100
I really have ways to do beautiful white

00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:09,550
space on the web the other is the

00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:12,550
ability to slide things or overlap

00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:17,080
things where we can use grid because

00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:19,000
grid lets us overlap things we can make

00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,950
them take up less space by sliding them

00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,900
one over top of another it's one of the

00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:25,420
biggest differences between tables for

00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:28,450
layouts and CSS grid and I've seen some

00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:30,820
blog posts written that say Oh see this

00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:32,470
grid the return of table based layouts

00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,240
you all think you're so fancy you think

00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:36,880
you're doing something new but we been

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:41,230
there done that and I don't like those

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,910
blog posts because in some ways yes

00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,830
there are some aspects of having rows

00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:47,230
and columns that are common to both

00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:49,390
tables for layout and CSS grid but

00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:50,830
there's some very significant things

00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:52,900
that are very different one of them is

00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:54,190
that you can overlap things you can have

00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,330
two different things kind of overlap

00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,950
each other so you don't need to cut

00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,660
things up into tons of puzzle pieces the

00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,490
way that you would have in the past you

00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:03,400
can just have the two things and they

00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:06,280
can overlap here's another example where

00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,870
the or here's an example in motion where

00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,180
you can start to see how things change

00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:11,770
as the overlap as there's less and more

00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:14,080
space and I'm adjusting the amount of

00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:17,230
overlap here's another with this teaser

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,940
card where as it gets bigger then the

00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:20,470
headline kind of slides off the image

00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,210
and as there's not enough space the head

00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:24,580
length starts to slide into the image

00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:26,380
there's all sorts of effects that we can

00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:29,440
take inspiration from magazines and such

00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:32,410
magazines use overlap all the time and

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,650
we can use overlap and sliding around as

00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:37,510
a way to take up and remove space so

00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:40,210
ways to do it contract and expand the

00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:41,440
space these are the four ways in which

00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:43,000
we can think about doing that as we're

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,600
thinking about designs and how to use

00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,150
design I have a mentioned before I have

00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,290
a youtube channel called layout land and

00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,150
there are two videos there's one

00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:53,530
specifically about overlap and what

00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:56,050
about white space where I go through the

00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:57,100
code and show you who are the all the

00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,570
front end developers in the room you

00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,870
want to see the CSS and how the CSS

00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:04,480
works all of that code is there too

00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:06,580
let's talk about new possibilities for

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,070
flexibility and specifically let's talk

00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:10,960
about columns we've been obsessed with

00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:14,170
columns since we first started doing

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,399
flow based layouts one thing about

00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:17,259
responsive web design the night

00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:19,269
didn't really realize and so I started

00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:22,839
thinking about what intrinsic web design

00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:24,879
is is that responsive web design as it

00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:28,179
shrinks and grows things it shrinks and

00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:30,399
grows everything at the same rate so

00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:32,409
you've got three columns and they shrink

00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,989
at the same rate they grow at the same

00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:37,659
rate if you remember which I vaguely do

00:33:34,989 --> 00:33:39,700
calculus and other math right like if

00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:41,109
you were to graph the rate of change it

00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,839
would be a straight line and everything

00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:46,269
would follow that same straight line

00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:48,639
it's this way because all of the widths

00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:50,739
are being set in percents even the space

00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:54,279
between the columns is being set in a

00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:57,399
percent with but with CSS great we have

00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:59,769
multiple ways to define a column or to

00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:01,899
define a row we can say I would love I

00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:04,599
would like this column to be fixed

00:34:01,899 --> 00:34:07,289
number of pixels or m's or REMS or veep

00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:09,700
viewport units you can use these values

00:34:07,289 --> 00:34:11,740
called min content or Max content you

00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,510
can use percents you can use Fr units

00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:16,089
which are awesome you can use min max

00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:18,190
you can use Auto so because you have

00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:20,200
this assortment of options and you can

00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:22,389
use them all in the same grid you can

00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:25,659
use one of each at the same time in one

00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:27,399
grid we've got a lot of possibilities so

00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:29,020
let's talk a little bit about FR units

00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,429
and in order to really explain what's

00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:32,470
going on with our units i need to tell

00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:36,399
you about main content sizing here we go

00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:41,849
down the rabbit hole so here's a

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:45,010
sentence and it's in a container and

00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:46,450
it's being wrapped because of the size

00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:48,099
of the container so this container has

00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,879
some sort of explicit size maybe it's

00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:50,529
two hundred pixels

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,329
maybe it's fifty percent but whatever

00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:55,059
the container is like I'm this size and

00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:57,339
the content is wrapping inside of it but

00:34:55,059 --> 00:35:00,400
if instead we set the width to be Max

00:34:57,339 --> 00:35:04,089
content on this container of text then

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,650
the box would be the amount of text the

00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:08,319
width that it needs to be for that line

00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:10,180
of text to be all on one line and no

00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:11,829
bigger it's kind of like be as big as

00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:14,770
you can be but don't be bigger than that

00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:16,569
that's what max content means or main

00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:18,250
content means the opposite it means be

00:35:16,569 --> 00:35:20,559
as small as you can be but don't

00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:23,529
overflow I don't want you to be smaller

00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:27,970
than your longest word when it's text I

00:35:23,529 --> 00:35:29,380
need you to stay like nice and keep your

00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:31,000
content inside yourself

00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:35,380
but get as small as you can get that's

00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,269
what men content means if instead you

00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,339
set that outer container to a percent

00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:42,519
like 25 percent well it's gonna be 25

00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:44,440
percent of whatever AIDS container is so

00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:45,970
if it's if it's 25 percent of the

00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,670
viewport and the viewport gets down to a

00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:50,349
hundred pixels then it's gonna be 25

00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:52,390
pixels and it doesn't really know

00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:55,470
whether or not the word is sticking out

00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:57,880
which is why we end up with this problem

00:35:55,470 --> 00:36:01,930
and we end up with mugs that look like

00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:04,119
this it's because there's no way for

00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:06,700
this box to know anything about the

00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:10,390
overflow state for its own container

00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:13,839
stuff if instead we say we don't use

00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:15,160
percents we use F our units F our units

00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,559
have this awesome built in thing with

00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:20,140
them where by default they never get

00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:21,849
smaller than the main content size so

00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,829
we're gonna put all of this mug company

00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:27,160
people making those mugs right out of

00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:30,970
business and you can see that here with

00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:33,250
this example where I've got four columns

00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,900
that are all defined as one Fr

00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:37,059
they're all growing and shrinking at the

00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,410
same rate along with each other but when

00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:40,000
it gets all the way down to the smallest

00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:41,799
smallest size you'll see that none of

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,470
those columns get any smaller than their

00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:46,000
main content size and the group of them

00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:48,279
then becomes this kind of fixed

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,400
container and the group will start to

00:36:48,279 --> 00:36:53,109
overflow the bigger thing that's what fr

00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,559
units are going to want to do it's kind

00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:55,680
of cool

00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:58,390
also you can see those images have a

00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,190
width of a hundred percent on them so

00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:03,039
they're the width of their row of their

00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:04,869
column but in the vertical direction

00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:06,640
they have a fixed height like I don't

00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:08,680
know 400 pixels or something and then

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,440
I'm using object fit cover to make those

00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,970
images get cropped and they they the

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,529
height doesn't go up and down the way

00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:20,079
that it normally would with responsive

00:37:14,529 --> 00:37:22,269
web design welcome to a new world so

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:26,289
here is another example where I've set

00:37:22,269 --> 00:37:27,789
one fr to fr for fr and six fr and what

00:37:26,289 --> 00:37:29,769
you'll see is the one if our column

00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:32,410
hates its mean content size first and

00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:35,410
then the two fr column and then the for

00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:37,450
fr comm and then the 6rf column so the

00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:39,460
rate of change that's happening is not a

00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:41,150
straight line it's a curve I don't

00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:47,270
remember the name

00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:48,800
I took calculus 30 years ago but it's

00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,880
kind of awesome it's kind of weird and

00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,590
it's kind of cool and it's kind of like

00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,020
what is going on around here where the

00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:56,420
6x column is like growing and shrinking

00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:58,100
much faster than the other columns this

00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:01,250
is part of the nature of what we've got

00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:04,040
now as our medium or here's an example

00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:07,310
three of these columns are 1fr and that

00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:10,370
other one is a min max of 250 to 600

00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:13,220
pixels which means hey you I want you to

00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:17,240
never be smaller than 250 I want you to

00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:20,570
never be bigger than 600 but there's two

00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:23,000
stages of squishiness the F our columns

00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:25,100
get smaller first while the min/max

00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,220
stays as big as it can be it stays at

00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:30,200
max size and then when the F our columns

00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:32,900
hit min content size and they can't get

00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:35,750
any smaller then the min max column

00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:38,240
starts to shrink down that the reason

00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:41,180
for that is because the F are units fr

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:43,490
means fraction of available extra space

00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:45,320
so hey when there's extra space this is

00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:47,930
how I want you to divide the extra space

00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,400
among yourselves but when there's no

00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:52,120
extra space you squish down squish stuff

00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,470
it's the max content the the min max

00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:57,920
column is not going to start to get

00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:59,840
pressure to shrink until the fr columns

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,430
have stopped shrinking so it creates

00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,900
this kind of two-tiered effect and we

00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:05,210
can design for that we can design a

00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:08,180
situation where something squish at a

00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:10,310
different time as other things here's

00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,870
another look to get more complicated so

00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:14,630
make you a little more confused we got a

00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:16,430
that first column is 200 pixels so it

00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:18,830
just fixed it just stays at 200 pixels

00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:20,720
the whole time and I've got to 1f our

00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:22,520
columns and I've got this min max column

00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,020
so you've got two stages of flexibility

00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,400
in the met and the with the flexible

00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,470
columns and then you've got a fixed

00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,590
column you could not do this with float

00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:33,710
n percent bastes floated responsive

00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:35,360
containers also the gap can be fixed

00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:37,880
which is really common maybe you want

00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:40,100
the gap to be 2 m you don't want the cap

00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,390
to be 3% because there's a lot of time

00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,070
when three percents to small there's

00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:44,510
other times when 3% is too big and

00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:47,720
that's been driving is crazy for 8 years

00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:49,610
set it in m/s you know why because the

00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:52,270
browser's doing the math and browsers

00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:54,350
are really good at doing

00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:56,510
to make it even more complicated I

00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:58,370
tossed in an auto in this particular

00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:01,820
situation auto is just like I want all

00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:03,260
the space so the fr unit column is all

00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,730
squished up small it just stays that

00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,980
main content the whole time because auto

00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:08,690
was a big hog if I'd have had less text

00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,250
or if I didn't have an image that had

00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:12,470
weighed 100 percent on it then Auto

00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:14,120
would become its max content size in

00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:16,820
this situation max content for that

00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:18,500
content is huge so it would if we kept

00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,760
going way way way way way out at some

00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,310
point it would hit max content and it

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,230
would stop growing these are the choices

00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:29,330
it gets even more complicated from here

00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:31,580
but that's enough for today however I

00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:37,970
just talked about columns in a

00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:39,500
horizontal TV situation all of that

00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:40,580
column stuff is I mean all that yeah all

00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,470
that column stuff if you go to a

00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:44,480
vertical direction just goes but but

00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:46,070
let's stay in a horizontal context you

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,230
can take all of that all of those

00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:50,900
abilities and you can apply them to rows

00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:54,470
which is absolutely profound there is

00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:57,380
nothing in CSS before CSS grid to let us

00:40:54,470 --> 00:41:01,310
do what grid rows lets us do it

00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:03,950
desperately changes design so I'm gonna

00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:07,310
show you this example the columns I've

00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:08,630
defined 1fr min max zero to forty

00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:11,480
characters did you know a character

00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:13,370
units or a thing yeah characters to one

00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:17,060
in another one F our column and the row

00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:19,940
Direction I've got 20% to Fr auto auto

00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:22,340
and one fr so those two auto rows that

00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:24,410
that black box in the gray box those are

00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:26,990
going to have text in them so auto when

00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:28,640
it's got text auto height means just be

00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:30,350
the height you need to be to hold the

00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,270
text don't be bigger don't be smaller

00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:35,720
just but is the size that it needs to be

00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:37,910
and then it's gonna have 20% is always

00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,470
going to be 20% of the total height and

00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:40,940
I've got something going on with height

00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:42,410
I think I don't remember what but

00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:45,290
there's some code to make the thing have

00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:47,360
a height and then two fr and one fr are

00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:50,240
gonna share whatever extra space is

00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:52,580
available and this is the result there's

00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:55,220
no media queries on this and you get

00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:58,100
this kind of dynamic flexible box where

00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:59,990
things grow or shrink in different ways

00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:02,720
they're flexible in different stages in

00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:04,340
each of the dimensions and it means I

00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,270
mean so many people are desperate for

00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,340
container

00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:10,460
and we want to create these teaser card

00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:12,260
layouts that work in any size context

00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,869
components that will be automatically

00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:16,550
magically resizable all the time if we

00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:18,140
don't need a media query then we don't

00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:19,850
need a container query and you can start

00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:21,770
doing this today before we have some

00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:25,160
sort of solution for contain our queries

00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:27,260
I talked more about main concept max

00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:30,170
content FR units and min max in a

00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:32,360
three-part series on layout land where I

00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:34,520
go into a bunch of examples and show you

00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:38,630
more about what those three things can

00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:41,030
do that is that's the new possibilities

00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:42,380
for flexibility so even just talking

00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:46,460
about flexibility it's so much more

00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:48,440
dynamic than it used to be and then

00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:51,800
number three I want to talk a bit about

00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:53,690
how all of this changes how we can use

00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,100
the viewport it gives us new options so

00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,810
the viewport of course is this

00:42:55,100 --> 00:43:00,110
all-important container the browser

00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:02,510
itself the window of the browser and the

00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:04,940
era of fluid web design our layout or

00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:08,810
content would pay attention to the top

00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:11,000
and both sides of the browser and the

00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:12,500
content that was in it and the fixed

00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,600
width era it would pay attention to the

00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,430
top edge and the left edge and a

00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,320
horizontal TV left-to-right environment

00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:19,550
but it would ignore the right edge it

00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,720
would sort of pretend that they didn't

00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,830
know where the right edge was it's

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,810
pretend like it didn't know where the

00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:26,090
bottom edge is responsive web design

00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:28,790
took us back to a time when we sort of

00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:30,590
when the layout the CSS rendering engine

00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:33,109
pays attention to the left and right

00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:36,440
edges it pays attention to the top edge

00:43:33,109 --> 00:43:37,850
but we do not pay attention to the

00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,170
bottom edge and instead we go to

00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:41,060
meetings where we try to convince

00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:43,940
designers and executives that there is

00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:46,060
no fold we have no way to control what's

00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:48,920
going to be above or below the fold I

00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:52,160
haven't seen a folding iPad yet right

00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:54,770
like but with intrinsic web design we

00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:58,220
actually can control and we actually can

00:43:54,770 --> 00:44:01,880
react to respond to create a layout that

00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:04,310
has a flexibility that involves that

00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,680
fourth edge of the screen and it does

00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:10,280
open up a whole new world possibilities

00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:12,770
we can Center things vertically we can

00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:15,320
use vertical viewport units and we can

00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:17,390
use grid rows in order to create layouts

00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:19,150
that are dynamic in both the horizontal

00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:24,140
and vertical direction

00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:26,000
here's an example I sort of copied the

00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:27,830
content off the Michael Pollan website

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,600
and I laid it out in kind of an how I

00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:30,200
would do it if I were doing this website

00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,780
today

00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:35,390
it looks good all the time it doesn't

00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:37,310
just sort of look weird in this random

00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:39,200
bottom edge it's responding to the

00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:41,060
bottom edge it's getting smaller so that

00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,500
it's got whitespace we're controlling

00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:44,450
the whitespace and like making it look

00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,920
beautiful at any time and of course if

00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:47,510
there was more content further down the

00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,790
page you could scroll and you could see

00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:51,859
that content then how did I do that I

00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:53,390
used that I did that by using CSS Grade

00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:55,580
there are no columns there's no need for

00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:59,000
columns I just have one big column but

00:44:55,580 --> 00:45:02,510
I've got several rows so the text both

00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,250
of those rows have Auto sized they've

00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:05,810
got margins on the text there's a little

00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:08,000
bit of space above and below that text

00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:10,369
but those two rows are set by Auto

00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,070
I've got the image in a min/max

00:45:10,369 --> 00:45:16,160
statement so once there's enough

00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:18,650
pressure on it it will never be any

00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,960
taller than 350 pixels and it will never

00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:23,750
be any smaller than a hundred pixels and

00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:26,000
then I've taken the extra space if you

00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:29,480
go beyond the auto height of the text

00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,150
and you go beyond the 350 pixel max of

00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:35,119
that house any other space that's left

00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:37,190
over I've said please put three parts at

00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,680
the top and put one part at the bottom

00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:41,600
and the whole thing is set with a min

00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,180
height of a hundred VH and so if there's

00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:46,340
not enough space for the content after

00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:48,290
the fr units have collapsed to zero then

00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:50,750
it will start to overflow in the page

00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:53,650
will scroll so very simple code but it

00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:56,690
gives us a very different way to design

00:45:53,650 --> 00:46:00,500
I've got a bunch more on viewport units

00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:03,350
and on viewports and on how to design in

00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:05,060
this kind of way on layout land it does

00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:07,070
change how we can use the viewport and I

00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:09,050
really hope the designers take up this

00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:10,550
possibility and if you're a designer

00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:12,500
check this out and play around with it

00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:14,300
if you're a front-end developer and you

00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:16,280
are bored with the designs that you're

00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:20,600
getting see if you can get in the room I

00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:22,580
think the real trick to this is going to

00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:24,200
be finding ways to communicate those of

00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:26,090
us who know CSS and those of us who know

00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,340
design to collaborate and to work

00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:29,690
together and to create prototypes and

00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:31,880
design in the browser and figure out

00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:32,750
what it is that we can create what this

00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,930
medium wants

00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:37,430
be now that we have this medium it does

00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:38,540
bring us to this idea of designing in

00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:42,020
the browser there's always this question

00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:43,730
of like should designers learn CSS right

00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:49,040
I have no more minutes to answer that

00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:50,570
question but I do think that in order to

00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,340
really do this kind of design this kind

00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:54,410
of design will be finished in the

00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:56,270
browser so even if the designer has

00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:58,070
finished with the PDF and emailed it off

00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:59,360
into space even if the people with the

00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:01,520
money have already said then they've

00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,470
locked it down and that's fixed and it's

00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,970
we figured it out it's done the

00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:07,250
front-end developer is going to be

00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:08,360
finishing the design if your front-end

00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,370
developer you're going to be sitting

00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:12,560
there figuring out how to interpret what

00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:14,270
you've been given and actually finish

00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,640
the design you might not consider

00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:19,550
yourself as a designer but that is what

00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:22,610
you're doing and in that spirit we have

00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:24,200
been building it at Firefox dev tools to

00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:26,690
make it easier to do this kind of work

00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:28,670
to do this kind of CSS and exploration

00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:30,530
in designing in the browser specifically

00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:32,210
the Firefox grid inspector the Firefox

00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:35,000
shaped path editor and the Firefox font

00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:36,380
editor this Firebug screen inspector has

00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,120
been out for a while but what's getting

00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,470
more it's getting some of the bugs fixed

00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,990
and it's getting more superpowers if

00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:44,270
you're in nightly you can now turn on

00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:45,830
more than one grid at the same time and

00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:48,800
use it on more than one grid at the same

00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:51,290
time it's a great way to visualize your

00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,670
grid if you're trying to learn CSS Grade

00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:54,800
you're trying to debug a layout that's

00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:56,750
been done in grid I found it really kind

00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,570
of impossible if you can't see the lines

00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:01,580
so I was like wow we need a way to see

00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:03,080
the lines like I think I know some

00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:05,150
browser people around here let's see if

00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,470
we can like boom here we go

00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:09,950
and there's lying numbers and there's

00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:11,930
area names for shapes you saw this

00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:14,150
earlier there's a CSS shape path editor

00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:15,770
you can use it both on CSS shapes shape

00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:20,510
outside property you can also use it on

00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:23,000
clip paths to help you tweak or adjust

00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:24,440
your shape path and to make it what you

00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,290
want it to be in order to accomplish

00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:30,200
what you're trying to do and this just

00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:32,270
shipped on Tuesday the Firefox fought

00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,920
editor we've had a font panel for a long

00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:35,810
time but we've change the font panel

00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,880
into what's now called the font editor

00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:39,800
and it gives you some sliders where you

00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,690
can drag and check then you can adjust

00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:44,480
your font size and your line height and

00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:46,980
the amount of bold turnoff italics a

00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,600
quicker way maybe then typing code

00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:50,550
but it's especially helpful if you're

00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,640
using a font that has a variable axes

00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:55,410
because then you've got a visualization

00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:57,210
of what axes are available it will list

00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:58,830
all of the variable axes on your

00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:00,390
variable font and it will give you a

00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:02,160
whole bunch of sliders it's a lot like

00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:03,960
access practice or V fonts or these

00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:07,290
other websites that are popping up but

00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:09,090
it's your website with your code and as

00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:10,500
you make changes all those changes are

00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:12,000
reflected in the rules panel that you

00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:15,330
can grab them and paste them into your

00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,930
code so this is intrinsic web design I

00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:25,109
really think that this fight might just

00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:27,450
be over we might be playing we might go

00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:29,790
to build some really cool sand castles I

00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:31,380
talk more about intrinsic web design on

00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:33,720
the big web show with Jeffrey's elderman

00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:38,850
episode 176 and also on shop Talk Show

00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:41,730
episode 328 to explain more of what I

00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:43,619
mean all sorts of things layout land

00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:44,970
youtube.com/ layout land or if you hate

00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:46,560
YouTube subscriptions and want to get

00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:48,420
updated when things come out you can go

00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:51,030
to layout dot land and subscribe by

00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:53,190
email I also have a website called lab

00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:55,590
site Jenn Simmons com where I have five

00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:57,300
years of examples now this is how I've

00:49:55,590 --> 00:50:00,000
learned what's possible is by making

00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,800
weird crazy examples including all the

00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,450
examples from today and they all have

00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,100
code pens as well you can click and go

00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:06,840
over to code pen and fork it and mess

00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:09,630
around and start to figure these things

00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:13,500
out yourself I really do think that this

00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:16,440
is an exciting time I hope that we take

00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:18,240
up the we don't just do that same you

00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,010
are in a unique layout over and over

00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,270
with twelve columns over and over and

00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:23,609
we're just doing it faster because we

00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:25,920
have CSS grid I really want us to take

00:50:23,609 --> 00:50:28,050
advantage of what's new in the medium

00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,760
and not get stuck with the idea that

00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:31,230
things are the way they're supposed to

00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,900
be because they were that way for a

00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:35,880
reason good reasons but as we had other

00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:37,050
ideas about how to do layout before

00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,450
we're gonna have other ones in the

00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:41,450
future and this to me is a huge pivot in

00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:44,830
a whole new direction thank you

00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:44,830
