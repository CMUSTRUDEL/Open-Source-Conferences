welcome to code narratology or how I

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,740
learned to stop bike shedding and love

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,679
the linty so bike shedding is this idea

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,960
that if you have a tremendously

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,420
complicated important project such as

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,190
building a nuclear power station nobody

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,570
wants to have an opinion on the really

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,699
big important stuff they'll just

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,320
rubber-stamp it but you want to be seen

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,510
to be doing something so you'll argue

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,330
endlessly about the shape of the bike

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,429
sheds now coders do a lot of this when

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,199
they sort of get hung up on where the

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,000
semicolon should go or what style of

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,219
functions and when I heard about these

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,440
debates it reminded me of when I studied

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,210
English in like the last year's of the

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,629
last millennium it sounds a lot like

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:45,120
literary critical theory so literary

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,489
critical theorists we've got this bunch

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,100
the formalists it's a lot of old white

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,690
guys you know that they would be active

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,629
on Hacker News and they would have very

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,910
strong opinions so there's a Russian

00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,829
contingent a French contingent and they

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,109
basically looked at the way that people

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,239
were reading novels and so this was

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,820
happening around the 60s at the time the

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,090
reader was meant to try and guess what

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,619
the author meant so not only did they

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,020
read the novel they read up on the

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:15,210
authors culture ethnicity historical

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,640
context they were trying to define what

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,000
the author meant now Roland Barth said

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,880
nonsense the death of the author

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,860
he said we should only look at a text to

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,320
find out about that text you can't

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:32,490
include details that are not in the text

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,079
and JK Rowling so we're going to build

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,420
this up if we take the example of a

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,640
post-it note a post-it note has an

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,990
author and a reader you would think it

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,220
might be the same person you might be

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,729
writing yourself a note

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,140
Roland bath says nonsense so he says

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,140
that the author and the reader they

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,840
still exist but they're not important

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,240
when we're looking at the text so these

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,520
two people pop into existence and

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,009
implied author and an employed reader

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,899
they're like virtual particles they just

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,750
a pop in if we take a bit more

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,689
complicated prose get milk he wrote on a

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,119
post-it note in his illegible scrawl

00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:10,649
okay that sounds kind of judgy and you

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,260
will actually find that the implied

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:15,780
author is this separate

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,659
director from the real author the

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,939
implied author is very smart a bein

00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:23,700
witty the employed author has got their

00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:27,090
stuff together the actual author might

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:30,060
be a bit of a mess now actually two more

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,909
people pop into existence now we have a

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,519
narrator and an air eighty so this is

00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:37,230
the actual character giving the the

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,690
narrative and the person receiving it

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:42,090
now quite often that they are implicit

00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:45,120
they might not be named but if we look

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,190
at really old timey texts let me tell

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,909
you dear either of the day he wrote get

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:53,790
milk the me is the narrator you dear

00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:56,879
reader are the naira T sometimes these

00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:00,269
are actual named characters in the text

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:03,599
so authors have a lot of fun with

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:06,359
narrators and narratology dracula is an

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,150
epistolary novel so every chapter is

00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:12,209
like a letter with a narrator and an air

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,400
eighty the girl on the train all hinges

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:18,449
on the narrator which I'm not going to

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,940
spoil so the narrator is the voice the

00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:23,129
face of the text a beautiful face and

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,310
really if the narrator is doing their

00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:25,470
job

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,989
you should barely be aware of the

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,250
applied implied author the employed

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,199
author should just be hanging around in

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:36,209
the background so what does this have to

00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:40,680
do with code what does this have to do

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:43,019
with code okay I don't have time to go

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,690
into the narrator implied reader and

00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,639
reader section they go in the bin

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,549
instead I'm going to look at the sort of

00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:53,730
writing section so the author the

00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:59,069
implied author and the narrator so those

00:03:53,730 --> 00:04:01,590
map in a fairly straightforward way I'm

00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:04,290
ahead of schedule so the author becomes

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,849
the coder they are real people but when

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,409
you're looking at the code those real

00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,629
people don't matter don't worry about

00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:11,729
them the implied author becomes the

00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:13,590
implied coder so all of those little

00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:15,750
flourishes you like to put into your

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,970
code all of the little stylistic things

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,989
that's the implied coder now the

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:25,440
narrator is a unified code style if your

00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:26,520
entire code base is using one style that

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,880
create

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,280
an era toriel voice okay it's very clear

00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,500
everyone can understand it now there are

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,240
several ways of achieving this you could

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,060
have all of your coders follow a style

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,000
guide and spend hours arguing about it

00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:45,270
in code reviews or you could just suck

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,669
it up and get a linter okay the linter

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:50,130
is gonna put a big happy face on your

00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:51,509
code no one needs to spend time bike

00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,610
shedding and arguing about it

00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:58,009
you do not want to be the miserable cat

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,009
in the background thank you very much

00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:10,100
Thank You Man thank you Matt and as my

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,020
gift to you

00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,620
here's your bad pun what did the

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:18,010
computers why did the computer spy quit

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:22,550
because he couldn't hack it anymore

00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:24,380
our next speaker is Ana and Ana has a

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,389
background designed video and

00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,620
photography and started developing for

00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:31,760
the web over ten years ago as a hobby

00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,530
fortunately she's never looked back and

00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,410
is currently a front-end developer at

00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:41,210
hacked our she's interested in ethics in

00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:43,789
the web sustainability and cat I didn't

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,440
do my job obviously so feel free to

00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:47,919
start whatever you want and press the

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,919
next button

00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:01,520
I'm here to talk to everyone who is

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,800
considering posting that draft poster

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,449
you have on your notes but still doesn't

00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,669
have courage to do it and you don't

00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:10,910
exactly don't know why but I've been

00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:13,190
there I've done that and I want to tell

00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,570
you as well that I don't want anyone to

00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,090
think that in order to be seen as a

00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,950
professional you have to blog that's not

00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,740
what I'm going for it's just for a final

00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:24,560
push that some of you like myself needed

00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,030
so one thing I'm particularly annoyed

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,680
about recently is that social media

00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:31,520
became a quick and accessible way to

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,910
share online however it was my blood

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,919
that recently we rather tweet a fur of

00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:40,070
our cats or career advice instead of

00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:42,650
blogging it which and the reason why I

00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:45,139
know is knit that is that when I go on

00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:47,120
holidays it's gone it's like when I came

00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:48,530
back if any of you posted the latest

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:54,139
front-end development I've missed it

00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:56,479
it's gone like a Tooting wind so I it's

00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:58,910
quite frustrating but not only that it's

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,160
not it's also not searchable unless I've

00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,780
memorized your name on all the day

00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:07,250
you've posted it I just cannot find it

00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:09,199
anymore or if you just don't have social

00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,780
media or if you're in a location or in

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,689
the country where social medias blocked

00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:17,719
its gatekeeping as well

00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:21,169
so at anytime your accounts can be

00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:24,199
deleted as well so I feel that we've

00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:26,299
replaced blogging with social media but

00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,209
I don't think it's working and it's

00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:32,449
affecting all of us as a community but

00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:35,059
slowly if things are changing and the

00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:36,739
community has been aware of this and

00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:38,659
talking about is about this more

00:07:36,739 --> 00:07:42,049
recently so for those of you who were

00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:48,099
here last year there was a presentation

00:07:42,049 --> 00:07:56,269
about the indie web as well or and sorry

00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:57,800
and okay so the things the community is

00:07:56,269 --> 00:08:00,559
aware of and we're talking more and more

00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,149
about it so there's initiatives like the

00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:03,889
indie wave or the new year

00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,989
hashtag which brings the community

00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:08,419
together and gives you all the tools and

00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:12,409
help in order to get your content online

00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:14,629
and stuff like that however my blocker

00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:16,069
is not technical but mentally so how

00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:19,009
many of you have tried to share

00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:21,289
something and thought I'm blank space of

00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:24,469
my content which to me usually means shy

00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:26,809
or embarrassed funny enough I only think

00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:29,539
about this when I'm trying to share

00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:31,219
stuff that is not technical so I want

00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:33,649
all of you to think that you're more

00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:35,349
than your job title whatever content you

00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:37,729
want to share especially on your blog

00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:41,509
it's valuable for the whole community

00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:43,309
and you should do it or I'm very guilty

00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:45,769
of this one everyone already knows this

00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:49,970
or why should i blog about this thing

00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:51,860
that i'm just learning and people think

00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:55,040
it's useless or they'll mock me and I'll

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,600
become a meme on the internet funny

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,029
enough that's not what I think at all

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,230
when I find something that I not

00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:01,910
particularly where I'm looking for I

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,740
just open a thousand tabs on my browser

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,269
and then if it's not what I want I just

00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,180
like close it I don't think poorly of

00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:09,709
anyone so why is why am I so harsh on

00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,620
myself why do I think my technical

00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:14,449
content is not good enough so these

00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,949
there are realistic consequences versus

00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:18,980
your fears well my fears to be

00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:20,629
constantly like like the ones I just

00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,399
mentioned but in reality I don't even

00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:24,010
have enough visitors in my blog to mock

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,240
me so it's just

00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:29,530
weird but you should embrace your fears

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,990
your fears are always in the back of

00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:35,440
your head and actually it's a bit of a

00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:37,510
survival skill survival skill just

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,290
acknowledge I mean work along with them

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:44,170
because they are like little checkbox

00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,970
for example I'm really afraid of people

00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:49,450
mocking my English skills therefore I

00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:51,250
just take along like three four five

00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:54,010
times to check if I don't have any typos

00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:57,160
and your fears are part of your

00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:59,380
personality and obviously the most

00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,060
direct consequence of blogging is that

00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,790
yeah it can actually help your career a

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:07,120
little bit you'll make it slightly more

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:09,190
visible or a lot but it is a direct

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,400
consequence but you should definitely

00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:13,840
just be having fun but mostly I'm here

00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,120
to tell you that I love reading about

00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,490
your experiences your thoughts your

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,440
travels and everything you do because it

00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,480
reminds me that my peers are not code or

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,050
design machines they are humans like

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,100
myself who have fears doubts enjoys

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,900
work-related or not and all your

00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,750
contributions keep the community going

00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:35,860
they stop the culture of overworking and

00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:38,470
they actually foster empathy so if you

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,360
do blog if you feel like this actually

00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:43,030
helps you a little bit to publish

00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,160
anything just send me your blogs please

00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:47,580
I'm really bored I need stuff to read

00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,580
and

00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,230
[Music]

00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:05,720
thank you Anna I managed to find a

00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:09,190
related plan for you

00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:15,110
why don't like ings like sending emails

00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:19,430
because they prefer North scold our next

00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:20,720
speaker is sim and sim is a Brighton

00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,120
based feelings web designer and

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,949
developer who has designed and built

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,639
innovative sites for clients of all

00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:30,529
shapes and sizes before going freelance

00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:32,930
sim was head of design and technology at

00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:35,060
an international publishing company his

00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,399
multifarious career also includes a

00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:40,069
decade as a journalist and several years

00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,600
as a homelessness campaigner luckily

00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:43,970
he's a passionate believer in the

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,910
benefits that wide and varied experience

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,649
can rig the weather industry and thank

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,699
you for the $10 words for a non-native

00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:53,329
English speaker

00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:55,279
they helped me improve on stage whenever

00:11:53,329 --> 00:12:10,550
you ready press the next button good

00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:13,130
luck okay Hey okay okay so I do a lot of

00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:15,769
work on WordPress building maintaining

00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:18,139
custom themes I'm both a designer and a

00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:24,439
developer and that's the kind of the

00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:26,269
subject of this talk cool Oh brilliant

00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:28,130
really cuz I sometimes feel a bit

00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:30,019
insecure about being both and that's

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,009
what this talk about is about so I

00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:33,110
sometimes

00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:36,709
design sites for other people to build

00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:39,670
that last slide was when I designed this

00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:42,800
is one someone else designed and I built

00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:46,509
the pliers came to me as illustrator

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,519
files of all things this is one I

00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:53,930
designed and built so it went from

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:59,779
concept to wireframes to a test site of

00:12:53,930 --> 00:13:03,800
final completion and support so and that

00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:05,750
was the custom thing okay so sometimes I

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,850
remember when I first went freelance I

00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:11,029
felt like being a designer and developer

00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,580
people would be amazed at my dual skills

00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:13,470
I

00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:16,070
this guy can do both but the reaction

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:19,410
I'm more normally got was that one

00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:21,180
suspicion as if people felt we can't

00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:23,990
really do both which one is it that you

00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:26,310
really do which one is just the hobby

00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,590
but so that's why I thought it might be

00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:32,190
useful if I shared some of my thoughts

00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:34,770
on doing both but it's not just other

00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:37,020
people's kind of suspicion you have to

00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:39,510
contend with it's your own sometimes I

00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,670
kind of feel like I'm kind of suspicious

00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:46,560
of myself of the fact I'm both a

00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:47,730
designer and developer because I

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,530
sometimes feel like okay well maybe

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,960
because I do both I'm not as good as a

00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:53,840
real developer or my designs I'm not

00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,790
gonna be as good as soon it just does

00:13:53,840 --> 00:14:00,060
design so I think in it in a way there's

00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:01,980
this this something in a way we people

00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:08,070
who do both we need to kind of redefine

00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:09,810
ourselves and what that involves is we

00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:13,890
have to kind of emphasize our walk

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:16,680
wide-ranging skillset because as people

00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:18,390
who do web design and development we can

00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,420
offer a combined service for smaller

00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:23,070
clients we can work in a larger team and

00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,500
just kind of divert our skills where

00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,390
they're needed and we also understand

00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:32,400
the perspective of the other side so to

00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:33,960
speak so we are so we design sites so we

00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:38,970
design sites they're easy to build and

00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:43,080
we do our best to kind of match the kind

00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:44,790
of vision of the original web design but

00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:48,030
most important I think working those two

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:50,160
areas help stretch your brain because

00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:54,300
you're developing mental flexibility of

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,400
working in two very different areas but

00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,960
I wonder if perhaps my own internal

00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,910
doubts about being a designer and

00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:03,020
developer stem from the fact we haven't

00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,020
claimed a real name for ourselves

00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,530
and names are important and that's what

00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:10,470
this this this slide is about if you

00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:13,080
don't claim a name for yourself perhaps

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,320
other people will will give you a name

00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:18,210
and names can say quite a lot about you

00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:22,050
so this is the name I've I've come up

00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:24,330
with the people like me who do both it's

00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,170
my best stab so far at it I thought

00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,420
about web

00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:29,040
designer but that doesn't encompass the

00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:32,490
kind of development side of it

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,019
I thought front-end designer but that I

00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:36,870
sometimes think front-end isn't a term

00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:38,579
that end-users understand so well so

00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,959
created developer is what I came up with

00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:46,380
but I'd be interested in people's

00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:48,959
thoughts I'm just oh here we go yes but

00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:51,269
if you're going to be do both if you can

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,130
include development and web design you

00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:55,829
need to make sure your superpowers are

00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:59,060
up-to-date so here are my thoughts on

00:15:55,829 --> 00:16:02,070
that firstly remember to specialize your

00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:04,790
field of expertise may be broad but you

00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:07,290
can still specialize in certain things

00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,970
get all the tools if you're doing a wide

00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,279
area you need you need the best tools to

00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:15,060
support you keep your skills up to date

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:17,010
and collaborate just because you can

00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:20,100
work on your own doesn't mean you should

00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:23,579
do all the time I work in a co-working

00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,930
environment in Brighton and some of the

00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:27,300
best work I've done is with other

00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:29,730
freelancers in different areas and what

00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,500
I could do both design and development

00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,769
it's been fantastic when I've worked

00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,769
with

00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,469
[Music]

00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:47,750
thank you sell your bedpan today as how

00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:52,600
many programmers does it take to change

00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:52,600
a lightbulb none it's a harder problem

00:16:53,649 --> 00:17:00,560
our next speaker is gonna be shot goofed

00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:02,050
up and she's a Muslim tech speaker

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,160
coming from Pune India

00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:07,339
she's a software engineer by profession

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,669
and the deep learning enthusiast in her

00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:13,480
free time she loves painting good luck

00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:21,249
when you're ready just press next

00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:21,249
[Applause]

00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,030
so I find deep speech really exciting

00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,530
because slowly we're moving towards end

00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,160
to end deep learning based solutions for

00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,650
everything

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,630
it was recognition before now it's

00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:06,700
speech recognition so traditionally the

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,679
way these systems worked was there was

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,660
an audio sent to the acoustic model that

00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:12,429
guess the phonemes that might be present

00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,890
and then that was sent to the phoneme

00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:16,630
model which guessed the words that might

00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:19,350
be present and then that was sent to the

00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,760
language model which tried to guess a

00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:24,100
probability of co-occurrence of words

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,730
for example the cat Tran and the Hat

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,559
Tran

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,610
so maybe acoustic and phoneme model

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,960
thought they were similar but the

00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,850
language model can come in and say no

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,549
that cannot possibly go together and

00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:35,200
then there's the output so there were a

00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:38,020
lot of failures of these systems like

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,179
low speech those were noise ratio and

00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,799
then speaker variability a very bad

00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:44,830
performance in natural and

00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:47,140
conversational speech now before diving

00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:50,140
into deep speech as such I would like to

00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:52,750
talk a bit about deep learning so which

00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:55,419
is a subset of machine learning methods

00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:57,370
which is based on learning data

00:18:55,419 --> 00:19:01,809
representations as opposed to task

00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:03,000
specific algorithms now deep speech uses

00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:05,590
end to end deep learning based

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,690
architecture and feed power neural

00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:09,880
networks is a very simple model of deep

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:11,919
learning so it basically is a bunch of

00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,559
nodes connected to each other in layers

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,740
weighted connections and each node

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,210
perform a small computation and there's

00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,580
a nonlinear function to squash the

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,950
output basically the gist is that you

00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:28,059
can basically approximate any kind of

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:30,250
function that you want to the parameters

00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:32,350
are found out by a series of back

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:35,130
propagation which is kind of like

00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:38,230
finding out the coefficients to equation

00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:41,049
but if you want something for a sequence

00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:43,450
space data like text or speech you want

00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:46,030
recurrent neural networks which are kind

00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:49,360
of the same but it has one time pick

00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:51,309
memory which is important because words

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,559
in a statement are related to each other

00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:56,169
right so the context the previous

00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:57,820
information is important so basically

00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:59,210
the output of a current node considers

00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,679
the input of

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,260
the current note as well as the output

00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:05,870
of the previous vote now deep speech

00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:08,210
uses as I said before end-to-end deep

00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:10,399
learning so you don't have to tell you

00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:13,010
don't have to have modules or hard coded

00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:15,830
features to tell it to look for phonemes

00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:17,690
or something else it just figures out

00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:20,840
how to eliminate noise it's it knows

00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:22,070
what features to pick so these are like

00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,309
there are a couple of feed-forward

00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:27,559
layers and then there's a unidirectional

00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:29,510
recurrent neural network so it doesn't

00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,039
have to be like you feed in the whole

00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,570
input and then you get the whole output

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,840
you can feed in one hundred milliseconds

00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:37,760
of audio get the output and then use

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,649
that as the initial state for the next

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:44,950
hundred milliseconds of audio so it was

00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:49,429
flawlessly for live transcriptions okay

00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:50,299
and so there's some stuff about CTP and

00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:52,429
softmax

00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:56,000
which I'll not get in the details of but

00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:59,899
for example if I say view source or if

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,220
I'm drunk and I say view source so the

00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:02,720
difference there's a difference between

00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,850
the lengths of the statements right the

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,279
CTC eliminates the need of having an

00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:09,409
algorithm for adding an alignment or

00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,549
padding it basically has a system of

00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:13,700
inserting repetitions

00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:16,370
sorry blanks between repetitions so as

00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,350
you can see here in view source there

00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,640
are blanks inserted and it eliminates

00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,980
them in backpropagation

00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,919
the development technology is Piketon

00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:27,200
c++ sensor flow they've used a lot of

00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:29,419
data sets to drain it like Fisher

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,350
switchboard and also common voice which

00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:34,970
I'll talk about in just a moment and

00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:36,799
using deep speech is basically as simple

00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:39,049
as our pipe installed in speech you get

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,510
a command-line utility to use deep

00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:43,760
speech you can use the models that have

00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:45,830
been published by Mozilla trained by

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,860
them for days and you can use their

00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:51,710
parameters to test your stuff very

00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:54,230
evening common voice project was

00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,690
something that Mozilla initiated to make

00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:59,600
voice technology open and accessible for

00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:01,760
everyone because when large corporations

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,039
use data sets they don't really publish

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,149
it for everyone you can go onto the

00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:09,239
website contribute your own

00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:12,539
and validate or validate other existing

00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:14,309
ones in your own language actually so

00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:16,889
there are a lot of languages that

00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:18,359
Mozilla is working on and if you want to

00:22:16,889 --> 00:22:21,119
contribute you can go to voice or

00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:23,849
Mozilla door to RG you can scan QR code

00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:25,199
to get the relevant resources or the one

00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:27,929
on the next slide keep your phone's

00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:31,919
ready you can go on to the github deep

00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:33,599
speech and contribute there and if you

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,309
have any doubts at all I'll be around

00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,729
the team hangs out on the machine

00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:41,129
learning channel on IRC and there's a

00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:42,719
live course channel also so that's all I

00:22:41,129 --> 00:22:45,839
wanted to say five minutes is really

00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:47,770
very short but do get back to me I'll be

00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:54,130
around thank you

00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:54,130
[Applause]

00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:00,390
thank you that was proper right and time

00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:02,669
I appreciate that if you didn't catch

00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:04,590
the QR code I'm gonna publish all the

00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:06,450
slides that weren't up here straight

00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:08,730
after death the lining talks you can

00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:11,159
check them out there in the meantime my

00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:14,039
bad plan for you is what did the

00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:20,330
motherboard say to the new software I'll

00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:22,919
show you who's boss next up is Andrea

00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:26,220
join me join me don't be shy on there

00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:28,429
I've never known you to be shy and this

00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:30,900
is Emma's latech speaker focused on

00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:34,049
decentralization technologies as you and

00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,240
and is an active member of the secure

00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:38,490
skuttlebutt community I hope I said that

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,070
right in the recent years he published

00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:43,740
book about Firefox OS and managed a web

00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:46,010
literacy program invulnerable vulnerable

00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,570
neighborhoods a Pheo

00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:50,640
he's a firm believer in empowerment

00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:52,890
through technological experimentation

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,610
really everybody with the $10 word thank

00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,770
you

00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:59,610
he moved recently to London where he

00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:01,380
lives with his wife Kat and more IOT

00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:02,700
boards that he can ever put into use

00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:11,610
whenever you're ready

00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:14,370
hit next and have fun so basically I

00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:17,190
just move it to London and it was a big

00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:18,630
move for me I'm Brazilian and I've been

00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:22,530
feeling something that we Brazilians

00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:24,600
call so dodgy so that is a difficult

00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:26,720
concept it doesn't really have a

00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,549
translation it's like a nostalgia

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,460
bittersweet thing you can feel so dodgy

00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:34,440
of the childhood games or so dodgy of

00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,440
things that were not lost in the past

00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:40,980
for example hamburgers it's a difficult

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,780
concept and the thing is that with

00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,210
different languages such as Portuguese

00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:48,210
or English you get different concepts

00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:50,400
that you can use more ergonomic or not

00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:52,200
it's very comfortable for use in

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,570
Portuguese this word saudades but it's

00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:58,169
really hard in English basically with

00:24:54,570 --> 00:25:01,080
new languages comes new concept or the

00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:02,850
easiness to use new concepts is the same

00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,890
thing with computer languages for

00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:08,640
example it's much easier to do to reason

00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:09,360
about relational data in sequel than it

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,840
is in the same

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,210
for example and I think that we need

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,400
more programming languages so that we

00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:20,190
can try more concepts but I want to move

00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:23,690
to an old concepts now which is

00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:27,870
basically agriculture a very old concept

00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:30,299
this is what the Europeans did in South

00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:32,220
America when they arrived plantations oh

00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:37,820
it's not there oh I mixed the slides you

00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:42,120
will see a plantation soon basically

00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:45,840
plantations are when you have a single

00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:49,260
monoculture everywhere all your eyes can

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:53,790
see is a monoculture and the thing is

00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:56,419
that plantations are very really not

00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:59,549
good for the environment or for you

00:25:56,419 --> 00:26:02,730
basically they degrade the soil and you

00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:04,790
can't survive on monoculture but there

00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:07,020
are alternatives for two plantations

00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:08,580
there are many alternatives and the

00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:12,809
degradation that they generate is

00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:14,850
horrifying one of the alternatives is

00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:17,100
something that was practice eyes by

00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:20,370
ancient civilizations in South America

00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:22,799
and it's called a mil per mil pay is not

00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:26,880
a monoculture NOPA is when you have

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:28,799
different cultures all together on the

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,950
same spot so you plant things that are

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:34,679
complementary so they help each other

00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:38,010
and they don't degrade the soil mayan

00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:41,040
milpas are still fertile today even a

00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:44,850
thousand years later and the thing is

00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:47,580
how this ties back to computer basically

00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:49,830
right now we are living on a JavaScript

00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:52,870
plantation

00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:54,940
it's a monoculture of JavaScript I love

00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:58,780
JavaScript just like like I love sugar

00:26:54,940 --> 00:27:03,039
cane and soy but I think that our

00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:05,350
ecosystem could be more fertile I think

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,480
that we need not to replace JavaScript

00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:10,750
with something we need to complement it

00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,700
with more stuff like a Mill pot and I

00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,440
want a web milpa I want us to bring more

00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,720
languages to the front end through web

00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:19,270
assembly and compilation to JavaScript

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,850
like elm for example I want us all to

00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:23,530
build web milpas and to prove to you

00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:27,400
that it is easy to build new languages

00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:28,780
this presentation here was created in a

00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:32,620
brand new language I just build a new

00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:34,539
language for this talk and basically if

00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:37,000
I can create a language any of you can

00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:38,760
create a language and I think that we

00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,900
should be experimenting more with

00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,090
building languages for the front end

00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:45,610
language that compile to JavaScript or

00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:47,909
at assembly I don't care I will even

00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:50,140
show you a piece of my language shortly

00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:54,039
so that you can see that I can have a

00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:55,809
lot of expression so just like learning

00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:59,230
a new human language that allows you to

00:27:55,809 --> 00:28:00,700
explore explore stuff new concepts you

00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:03,190
can have a language for example for

00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:06,070
making slideshows that makes it natural

00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:08,770
to use the slideshows and you can bring

00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:11,020
that to the web so the call to action

00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:13,480
for you always let's experiment with

00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:16,179
languages let's experiment with new

00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,760
forms of expression in the web let's

00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:21,429
build a web milpa together so that our

00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:25,240
future ecosystem might be as fertile as

00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:27,100
a Mayan web milpa I would like to thank

00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,570
you all for having me here and I think

00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,450
that if you want to talk more about

00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:34,990
languages and see the very nice and cute

00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:37,450
parts that I built for this just hit

00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:40,750
outside and we can talk I can show you

00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:44,559
the source code it's brand easy and I

00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:47,320
think that we should all be playing with

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:50,200
this stuff the source code is on github

00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:56,080
and I'm on every single platform besides

00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:58,720
Facebook I'm slowly moving and basically

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,510
just thanks for having me here

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,630
let's build languages for client-side

00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,630
