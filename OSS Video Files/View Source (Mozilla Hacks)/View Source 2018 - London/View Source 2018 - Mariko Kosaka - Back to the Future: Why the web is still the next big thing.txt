gave that talk title few months ago and

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,280
I just didn't the Allies that I sit like

00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,229

I'm Ashley Japanese and being true

00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:18,110
Japanese myself my Toyota is more like

00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:23,450
the web is actually okay it's like it's

00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:25,250
fine so the thing is I again my name is

00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,140
like oh I woke in New York City I work

00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,750
at a Google with a team that built

00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,200
Google Chrome and being the web

00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,850
developer inside a browser vendor

00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,830
exposed me to a lot of comments like

00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,899
well you think what is the best and you

00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,000
know i'm i OS engineer and before we

00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:43,369
start the conversation I'm gonna like

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,590
make a conversation that like I like iOS

00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:49,940
and not a web and I'm like do you like I

00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:53,060
don't need he care like I like web view

00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:57,159
like other stuff that's fine too

00:01:53,060 --> 00:02:01,159
so anyway so that's all we gonna start

00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:03,950
so this talk came through a year ago

00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:07,250
almost exactly a year ago last year at a

00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:10,579
chrome dev summit we host a annual

00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:12,380
conference and we had this little video

00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:14,209
booths where attendees can go up and

00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:18,110
then talk about like why they like the

00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:19,549
web and announcing this I was MC for

00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,980
that conference announcing this are not

00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:24,650
my co M C Mon occurred in Cuzco she just

00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,510
like London we sit to me and say like so

00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:29,000
why do you like a web and I was just not

00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,370
prepared to answer it I didn't have the

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,890
answer and I'm like the thing I said was

00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,980
that the web is the only platform I

00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:39,620
built something on so it's like it's

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,660
more like you know I was it I didn't

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,780
need a shop around and decided to be web

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:50,690
developer I just like did only web you

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:53,120
know so I have a somewhat typical tech

00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,519
story that I got access to computer and

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,720
I got access to Internet at age of 10

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,840
and my amazing parents let me use

00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,970
internet after 11

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,430
[Laughter]

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:10,320
supervise and I discovered this whole

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,540
internal communication one part that is

00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,000
not typical of tech career is that I

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,770
didn't get into coding like my parents

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,020
or technical person and math teachers

00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,510
they gave me every opportunity to pick

00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:23,430
up into it they didn't force me into it

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,260
I wasn't interested I was interested in

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,180
needing I was doing the interesting

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,420
origami and crafts and everything but

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,130
Internet wasn't my thing so when I was

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,660
thinking of like what do I do with my

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,070
life I was like I want to walk on an

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,500
Internet company I want to study

00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:40,680
Internet so that's what I did I went to

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,440
college dirty Internet so the things

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,470
that I would do at college was like lead

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,450
a garden of forking paths from booze or

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,090
or you know leader things as we may

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,890
think so garden of forking paths is

00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,440
attributed as they first snowball that

00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:58,230
kind of introduced the idea of hypertext

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,950
and then as we may think is a version

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:05,400
article from 490 forty five and the

00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:08,700
headline there is like super fascinating

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,880
it's like a top US scientist foresees a

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:16,290
possible future world in which man-made

00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:23,700
machine will start to sink machine

00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:26,280
learning yes AI anyway so when I was

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,890
figuring not what I want to do internet

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:32,340
communication what's thing I wanted to

00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:34,920
do and that's what I studied and that's

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,290
how I got into not necessarily according

00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:41,040
according to happen accidentally

00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:43,470
actually and it's very fortunate that it

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,770
is good paying financial choice so that

00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,660
became my career but my start was that I

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,940
wanted to work an Internet company that

00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,990
makes communication tools and that's how

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,050
I got started

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:58,590
like kind of like a product manager job

00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:01,080
so another story last year well a few

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:04,170
months ago I was assigned what I chose

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:07,290
to do a project thinking about how those

00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:10,380
browsers actually work this came in a

00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:13,080
interesting situation where Iowa was

00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:15,510
sitting next to browser engineers the

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:19,020
person who read C++ to make a browser

00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:21,720
application and a expert a web developer

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,820
my colleague who know more about

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,550
browsers that what more about web

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:28,230
development than I do and I was just

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,360
listening to their conversation and

00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:32,280
their conversation was not making sense

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,770
to me even though we were building a

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,290
same application together there was just

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:39,180
a whole another level of like whoa will

00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:42,480
that use like such-and-such thread and

00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,760
will this do blah and I was just like

00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,670
hold on a second what kind of lizard

00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,590
speak are you two are doing I know Nene

00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:52,050
understand and I realized that I need to

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:55,200
understand the environment of which my

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:59,910
code is running so I took on a research

00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:03,210
project to research and communicate with

00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:06,240
other people who like me who might not

00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:07,410
know those things so what man was that

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,210
like I need to dig through like

00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,610
nine-year-olds like YouTube video I

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:14,370
don't watch like 45 minutes of VP of now

00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:17,130
engineering at a chrome explaining a how

00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:23,130
chrome worked but what came with it was

00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:24,810
interesting results that in in trying to

00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,210
understand how browsers were built I

00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:30,660
watched a lot of video and I did a lot

00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:32,730
of article about why this new browser

00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,060
that they were building but whether it

00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:38,760
is a new version of Firefox or bobkid or

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,740
calm they were explaining a lot about

00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,840
like here's a landscape ten years ago

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,670
and here is a pain points that we have

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,730
and here's how we were changing it so I

00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:50,880
kind of got to see the like evolution of

00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:53,190
how the landscape where front-end

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,010
development and web development lived

00:06:53,190 --> 00:07:00,210
through so I wanted to share how the web

00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:04,830
became what it is guided by me based on

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:08,850
my a lot of internet meeting so internet

00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:11,340
started as we may know as a way to share

00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:13,830
documents you know you need to hyperlink

00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,290
and you can just share documents or

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,630
research paper published in the other

00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,220
side of the world and just use network

00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,110
to get those things without you

00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,490
physically going to library or getting

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:28,350
fax machine you know I don't know what

00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:29,580
they did back then but but Internet or

00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,069
the web didn't end

00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:35,849
there it quickly gained ability to style

00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:39,030
things we gain the ability to end that

00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:41,219
stuff my images and I find it so

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:44,879
fascinating that like the start of the

00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:49,439
IMG tag image style is documented in a

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:53,430
w3c mailing list archive here is mark on

00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:56,340
Juicin now VC I guess back then in the

00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:59,400
research facility building a web browser

00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:01,770
saying like I've got a propos attack I

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,240
am G I have an implementation and I'm

00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,849
gonna ship it and that's how it became

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,370
and what's more interesting is that like

00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:10,319
all of those earlier conversation about

00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:12,409
what kind of things should go into the

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,629
web what kind of things that this

00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:19,919
hypertext markup language support is

00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:22,139
documented in the mailing list archiving

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,169
this message on that thread is test

00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:29,340
again uh-huh if you open it it says

00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:32,550
please ignore I'm like really I'm really

00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:35,279
curious what the number 0 message was

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:37,560
that's not documented there but what's

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,269
amazing is that like it's open and there

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,750
is a discussion and documentation about

00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:44,910
it in fact if you go w species website

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:48,079
you find it that the open web platform

00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:51,060
is the collection of open royalty-free

00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:53,970
technologies which enables the web so

00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:56,810
the web from the get-go was built in

00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:59,430
open it wasn't like some proprietary

00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:01,560
company and some product managers and

00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,630
business persons decided like whoa in

00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,089
order to use IMG tag you need to pay us

00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,230
like certain subscription fee to and

00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:09,060
then like if you want to use like

00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,949
high-resolution image like there is

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,600
another tier like that's not that way

00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:14,880
it's like everybody brought in the

00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:19,709
technology the implementations and then

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:23,040
bring it into the platform so back then

00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:25,350
when these things are happening how was

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,720
the browser technology like looked like

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,570
it was a single process browser and I

00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:36,060
was gonna cover what that means so when

00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:38,130
I say process in computer term process

00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,839
you can its abstraction on top of your

00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,089
program you can think of like your

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,750
application code runs inside a process

00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:44,850
and

00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,250
within that process you can divide them

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:50,130
into different threads to kind of like

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:52,350
assign each tasks but essentially like

00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:56,190
one unit of your application is a

00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:58,770
process so if you double-click on any of

00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:00,600
application you might see that window

00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:03,870
pops up and then your application starts

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,630
what's happening underneath is that when

00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:09,900
that icon is double clicked and the

00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:12,630
application is starting up space in

00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,780
memory is reserved for process process

00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:18,180
runs on that memory and everything that

00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,280
happens on your application is stored

00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,680
into the memory and that's how you know

00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,260
the like you know how this application

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,720
is one so if you close that application

00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:32,850
then process also goes away flinging up

00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:35,310
a memory cool so far okay so at the

00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:37,890
beginning browser process was only one

00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:42,300
thing it had everything inside one

00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:45,450
process it had a code that controls a UI

00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:48,450
code controls downloading a resources

00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:53,730
that could lend during the pages

00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:56,040
everything in one place and you might

00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:59,430
think that like oh this is all of our

00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:02,190
desktop and things but mobile web also

00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:04,790
existed from the beginning you might not

00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:09,240
know it I do because I'm Japanese

00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:11,880
because so if you go to Computer History

00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,510
Museum in Mountain View there's actually

00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:18,330
a I guess like archival entry oh I mode

00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:23,460
so the park says I'm owed information

00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:26,070
mode phone by dockable 1999 Japan built

00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,720
the first popular system for mobile web

00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:31,650
access

00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:34,470
so technically AT&T had a pocket net bad

00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:37,320
had a access to the Internet on the

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:39,180
phone in u.s. but you know machines like

00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,620
Computer History Museum and United

00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:44,490
States is saying that this is the first

00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:47,190
I'm gonna claim that my country I guess

00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:50,550
that the popular system was the key I

00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:53,010
distinctly remember late 99 when

00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:55,640
everybody was switching to a mobile

00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:58,730
phone flip phone from

00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,680
pager that was also very popular like

00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,080
every high school girl had a pager and

00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,210
then like send a message by going to

00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,890
public phone like you have a pager to

00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:08,720
display message but you go to public

00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:11,210
phone and put my coin in it and then put

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,770
the numbers to dial the message and then

00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,690
your friend received a message text

00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:17,990
message that was the thing that's

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:20,420
happening in Japan so I do distinctly

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:24,050
remember that the communication device

00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:26,990
shifted to a mobile phone so even though

00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:29,240
the service was leased in 99 research

00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:33,200
started research the development started

00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:37,880
97 and NTT DoCoMo made a in my opinion

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:41,690
very key decision to choose HTML or the

00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:44,960
web technology for they're like getting

00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,970
the content from the internet knees for

00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,520
those of you who were doing mobile

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:52,190
development back then there was another

00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:55,160
proposed standard more not just proposed

00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:58,520
it was in years called WEP WAP

00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:02,630
that wasn't a HTML base that was another

00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:05,170
way and if that had warned or that had

00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:07,730
became a de facto standard then in

00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:10,190
reality now we might be having a

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:12,200
front-end web developer and from an

00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:14,390
mobile developer who is doing completely

00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,850
different thing but NTT DoCoMo decided

00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:20,030
that no everybody's making website like

00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:22,580
web is happening we're gonna use

00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:24,770
Internet up HTML because that's how

00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:29,720
you're gonna get content publishers to

00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:31,640
publish so this is the first phone like

00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,820
I mode phone that you would have like it

00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:40,030
wasn't even a color screen it had this

00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:43,580
tiny tiny screen to display a text-based

00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:47,060
website but what was amazing is that

00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:49,640
back then if you have a mobile phone

00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,830
which was affordable in my opinion they

00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,900
had a lot of marketing so like I was

00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:56,060
high school in early two-thousands like

00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,070
you know not like not the first first

00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:01,850
generations who got those phones but

00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:04,580
like second wave like I can pay 20 bucks

00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:06,560
a month and own one of those phone and

00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:09,610
have text message access to Internet

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:13,880
access to email it also came with a

00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:17,240
email address which is kind of amazing

00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:20,720
to have all like the high schoolers in

00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:25,640
early 2000 had all of that those

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:27,800
accesses anyway so I'm or this person

00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,720
who walked on the kind of like

00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,480
communications part of that I mode

00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,570
decided to use HTML he actually read the

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,170
HTML spec he told us scale it down and

00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:42,380
made what's called C HTML because iPhone

00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:44,630
sorry I mode phone like tiny screen with

00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:48,980
low-power devices probably single core

00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:51,650
cpu again that and like low port and

00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,870
vile man compared to now he was like me

00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:55,610
we don't need some of the HTML tax I'm

00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,970
just gonna need to spec and delete the

00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:02,150
stuff that we don't really need so that

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:06,380
happened another political invention

00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:10,690
alive motor was invention of emoji but

00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:14,630
emoji came in with relation to web so

00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:17,390
the phone's fly mode had a browser that

00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:21,710
can download text and image in different

00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:26,270
sockets actually but back then data was

00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:28,700
expensive er and doing that land

00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:33,020
boarding and laundering takes a lot of

00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:36,680
memory space so the guy who invented and

00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:40,070
mozi had the idea where what if all of

00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:42,050
the pictures or icons that commonly used

00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:46,040
or please install through the phone and

00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:48,590
all we do is send a code points to phone

00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,350
so you only need to send text don't need

00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:55,490
to waste the data on image and on the

00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:57,440
phone just display an image back then I

00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,240
mode was trying to be kind of like an

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,040
information you know information mode

00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,160
right so they wanted to show weather

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,380
forecasts they wanted to show news and

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,410
they wanted to have like some visual

00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:12,890
icons not just like wall of text so

00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:15,590
that's how emoji got invented and that's

00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:18,740
Horner the talk and obsession of mine if

00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:22,010
you want to go into details about emoji

00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,149
but point is mobile existed mobile was

00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:27,319
built based on

00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:30,559
the the philosophy of the web then 90s

00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:32,870
to 2000 here comes the leech internet

00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:36,559
application era I don't know what it was

00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:38,660
called in UK or us certainly in Japan we

00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:43,129
called it which Internet application all

00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:46,370
ia and this is the time I graduated a

00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:48,499
college and I got into industry job what

00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:52,430
it man was the oh brother looked like

00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:54,620
this browser was basically a frame that

00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:56,990
delivers another frame that downloads

00:16:54,620 --> 00:17:00,639
content and then do something else it

00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:06,980
was just like this place where a plug-in

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:10,100
will do something and I remember my

00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:12,860
first job there wasn't a front-end

00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:15,049
developer team or split between back-end

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:17,390
and front-end it was applications team

00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:19,549
and the web systems team where

00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:22,370
application team or a group of flash

00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:24,559
developers who typically had like a game

00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:28,459
development study background and then

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:30,610
the web team was combination of now what

00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:33,230
we call back-end but also PHP and HTML

00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:36,260
developer who would be building those

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:40,730
flames that delivers those plugins so

00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:42,350
it's very different landscape now of

00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:45,409
course some people started using

00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:48,110
JavaScript and Ajax and you know google

00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:50,990
map happens and a lot of invention

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:53,029
starts to happen but this is typically

00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:55,460
the era where everybody was thinking of

00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:58,220
like Oh web there's gonna be a black box

00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,350
a white box in the browser and an inside

00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:04,340
of that some other technology is gonna

00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:08,330
figure that out so what happened in that

00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:11,450
era of you know the way we build a web

00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:13,730
page your website's a web app slightly

00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,980
shifting to play game base while browser

00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:20,330
also starts to change this is around the

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:24,860
time 10 years ago chrome shipped or came

00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:28,700
into the market so the single process

00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:31,490
model that I talked about you can spin

00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:34,520
up another process 1 process on the

00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:36,440
buter can spin up next process and kind

00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,660
of offload part of the

00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,790
work two different process and in

00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:43,220
between them they work they can use what

00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:46,490
we call inter process communication or

00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:49,220
IPC to communicate those stuff what's

00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:51,530
the bad thing about this well it's gonna

00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,990
use a lot more memory space because each

00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:57,350
process it needs to have their own

00:18:53,990 --> 00:19:00,110
memory space but if you know by

00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:02,360
separating those stuff if one process

00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:04,760
goes unresponsive and then like say you

00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,090
have a graphics process that went

00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,710
unresponsive and your screen is frozen

00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:12,380
all you have to do is just close the

00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:14,030
graphics process Andy start it again you

00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,580
don't need to shut down and tie your

00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:18,200
application you just need to restart

00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,570
parts of the application and your

00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:24,640
application keeps going so it's a lot

00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:27,560
more like gains a lot more stability so

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,230
currently browser now might look like

00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:32,870
this whole bunch of process inside of

00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:35,570
each process have different methods or

00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:37,070
in Chrome's case if you're on like a

00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,750
powerful computer you might it might

00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:42,500
look like this many many many more

00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:45,230
process in case of Chrome

00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,720
they do think or service' fication which

00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:49,700
meant that they Chrome the application

00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,650
itself gonna determine like okay how

00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,690
many resources can we use does this have

00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:56,540
a lot of memory does this have a a lot

00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:58,610
of core on the CPU and if so then they

00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:01,100
spread up to many process because it's

00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:03,530
better right like if device process

00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:06,710
feels then you know other process still

00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:10,060
keeps going but if you are on like low

00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:12,770
powered devices or phone then Chrome my

00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:15,020
consolidate certain thanks to one

00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:18,440
process to in order to save that memory

00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:21,500
footprint on your device so you have a

00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,210
little bit of like smart know changing a

00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,810
little bit of architecture kind of work

00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:29,630
we call it service application anyway so

00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:32,210
separate process means that one process

00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:34,820
one part of the memory was gonna learn

00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:37,520
like UI and network request like you

00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,320
know typically call a browser process we

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,620
might have another process for the web

00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,840
content itself where your application

00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:47,870
code lands we call an endo process

00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,760
probably the most key if you are looking

00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:51,410
at from web development point of view

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,230
and you know if you have something like

00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:57,350
flash still planning process is going to

00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:59,110
take care of that part so multi-process

00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:04,790
architecture

00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:06,650
each tab became process two for chrome

00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:09,530
introduced idea of each topics I get

00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:12,530
each own processes what's good about it

00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:15,620
is that if one sites have I don't know

00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:17,600
like very heavy operations or while true

00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:19,640
loop planning or something you just need

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,250
to you can just you know stop that

00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,320
process and close that tab and you don't

00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:27,410
need to lose any other tab because it's

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,750
in the separate process if each of the

00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:33,230
all of the tabs are on in one process

00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:35,690
then if one page gets responsive then

00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:38,780
you have to close them all and they

00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:42,470
start a chrome and that's unhappy right

00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:45,050
so if you're curious about this I have

00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:48,470
way more detailed post on like four part

00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:50,810
series please do take a look I have a

00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:53,690
lot of cute pictures I promise it's not

00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:57,020
this wall of text I really try to make

00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:59,990
it fun and a little more different

00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:05,000
introduction to as you might find it on

00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:08,510
code documentation so it's not only me

00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,270
Mozilla published amazing array of blog

00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:14,870
posts with again a lot of pictures I

00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:16,280
love link lurks quote cartoons and also

00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:18,500
like you know you might think like

00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,330
WebKit as like WebKit or Safari as like

00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:23,030
a mysterious browser but they do

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:25,490
actually provide a lot of good blog

00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:27,800
posts about how the behind the scenes of

00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:30,320
browser work so if you're curious it's

00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,270
not just my blog post or Chrome it's all

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:36,380
of the browser's are doing it highly

00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:38,750
recommend leading so in that era of

00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,640
multi-process architecture and a lot of

00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:43,010
things coming into the browser what

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,070
changed well we've been talking about

00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:48,710
how more powerful how powerful hardware

00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:51,440
became like the hardware changing is

00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,820
what essentially allowed chrome to go

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,970
multi-process architecture

00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:58,670
if hardware was still single core was

00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:00,340
limited memory then we wouldn't even try

00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:03,200
to do those things

00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:06,260
nothing is evergreen browser

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,470
is an idea that we have now like it's

00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:11,389
amazing that once you restart the

00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:13,669
browser there's gonna be a new version

00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:18,409
of it installed you don't need to think

00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:21,380
about warning users to move off of ie6

00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:25,429
because that's like not supported like

00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:27,799
every six weeks Chrome or Firefox just

00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:30,940
downloads new version and all you have

00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:34,100
to do is they start it that's amazing

00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:37,100
another one is browsers are getting even

00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:40,639
more secure by separating those

00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,299
processes and it became a lot of hot

00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:44,000
topic

00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:46,760
I learned January when specter and

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,549
meltdown security vulnerability happened

00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,320
so a little bit of like why it's like

00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:54,620
separating processes are good for

00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,929
security so as I mentioned browser

00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,330
process that controls like browser tabs

00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:00,889
the network request exists and then

00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:03,799
lender process that takes care of

00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:07,340
content exists lambda process this one

00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:09,710
is the most important part because this

00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:13,580
process is downloading arbitrary code

00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:16,789
from the internet and executing it on

00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,190
somebody else's computer that's kind of

00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:20,929
scary

00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,730
if you think about it the web web

00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:25,429
downloading the web and displaying the

00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,990
web in that way it's kind of scary so

00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:30,409
how does it stop browser make sure that

00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:32,539
nothing goes wrong so you know you don't

00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:33,950
the process inside a blender process you

00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:35,809
might have application you might

00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:38,269
deployed those applications saying like

00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:40,370
oh I have application I need to update

00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:43,159
this data I want to download Jason or I

00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:45,230
want to have another XML file so they

00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:46,460
say send IP C name to process

00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,710
communication saying like I need

00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,600
resource and then browser process the

00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:53,870
spawns was like okay let's download it

00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,120
but within the browser process they will

00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:59,510
check a few first few bites the header

00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,940
part of the data and checks if that's

00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:04,760
safe but they were checking is like is

00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:07,549
this a mime type correct saying like you

00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,679
know if somebody is sending oh this data

00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:12,379
is image but if they were actually

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:15,620
sending script tag that can cause

00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:16,880
problem or this is where the safe

00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:19,730
browsing happens

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,920
my house go on to access certain website

00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:23,480
and then browser tells you this is known

00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,130
phishing site do you really want to

00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,230
continue this is where that Safe

00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:29,840
Browsing checks happens and if they

00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:32,470
detect that it's not safe or they should

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:36,860
be blocked then that data will never

00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:39,230
access the lender process memory that's

00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:41,720
important because with specter and

00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:43,700
meltdown anything in the memory can be

00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:48,200
read and everybody kind of freaked out

00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:50,300
like oh my god what do we do so blocking

00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,590
those in the separate process is super

00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:58,460
important and key part of security

00:25:53,590 --> 00:26:00,710
anyway so it's not just browser that

00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:03,560
gained a lot of like you know whoa now

00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:05,810
we are more stable at a faster it's not

00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:09,620
just that the web itself got a lot more

00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:13,340
capable the use of web technology or the

00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:16,460
web web browser is used changed from in

00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:18,800
front of big box computer using Mouse to

00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:21,770
phones like this one and just tapping

00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:24,020
into it so in order to accommodate that

00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:25,670
web platform added you know the pointer

00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:28,010
events that has a lot more garage

00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:30,130
analogy into how the point event works

00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:32,750
without pointer events I cannot imagine

00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:36,470
writing a like a drawing application

00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:39,470
that can draw smooth line very song for

00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:41,390
that you know as web application glue

00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,310
people had idea of like wow I want to

00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:47,240
access local files cuz I want

00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:48,950
drag-and-drop local file and then do

00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,410
something and then like download the

00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:54,500
data again so they add it like file

00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:58,190
leaders a lot like if you think about it

00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:01,550
these tags or features on the web

00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:05,120
platform didn't exist like more than ten

00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:07,750
years ago it's amazing so so my first

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,730
job out of college as a like you know

00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:12,440
not a coder about working at an Internet

00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:16,370
company was a video streaming

00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:18,260
application company and whenever we have

00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:20,930
a new client we would have this line

00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:23,360
item in our budget saying like oh and

00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:26,360
then our flash developers kind of design

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:29,150
video player so that's gonna be another

00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,530
thousand dollars but nobody things like

00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,570
that like

00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:34,460
now you know if you're building a video

00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:35,810
application site nobody's gonna think of

00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,030
like oh I need to hire a fresh

00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:40,220
developers to build me a web player or

00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:42,620
like I need to find a library that does

00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:45,020
a web player you just use a video tag

00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:47,810
right and then you might use JavaScript

00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:50,360
to customize certain things but these

00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:53,600
primitives Network the the problem

00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:58,850
primitives did not exist and web gained

00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:01,430
over time so what's coming next

00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:04,720
I figured I should like look a little

00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:09,200
further than what was done and to me

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,390
2018 started in 2017 seems to be that

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:17,390
everybody's talking about webassembly

00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:19,970
or was him and for leak app was him is a

00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:21,290
technology it's a compiled target for

00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:23,240
the web so if you were writing

00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:26,540
application code it can be anything like

00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:29,240
game utility tools for the thing you

00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:32,090
would write some kind of things in rust

00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:35,780
or C++ or what have you and then you

00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:37,220
would compile it to have on your desktop

00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,470
as an app oh it doesn't have to be a

00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:42,950
desktop it could be a phone but you know

00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:44,690
you compile it to be and up now we're

00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:47,780
assembly is the technology or the

00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:50,810
compiled target to do the same for the

00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:52,730
web so you might have seen in the

00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:56,480
context of web assembly seeing like oh

00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:58,700
look this very popular game is now like

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,990
ported to web assembly and running

00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:05,450
inside of the browser so seems to excite

00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:07,730
a lot of people but also seems to get a

00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:10,310
lot of comments like so it was amazingly

00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:13,160
placing JavaScript right I don't like

00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:15,860
mmm I don't think so

00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:19,100
and it to me well that would the worst

00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:21,920
one is two people who's like oh now we

00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,780
can use grown-up language to write for

00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:28,430
the web and I don't like I'm kind of

00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:31,280
offended I'm like I love JavaScript so

00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:34,550
to me when somebody makes those comment

00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:36,350
I feel like they have a mindset that the

00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:38,000
web's gonna look like this and instead

00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,960
of a shockwave they just gonna hop

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,330
wasn't there

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,820
you know what I mean they and rightly so

00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,120
a lot of like fashi demos are like a

00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,600
full

00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:49,550
scream game on browser and it's just

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,670
like everything inside of this community

00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:55,580
one byte was him but to me wasn't it's

00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:58,430
not a leap race man or the progress that

00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:01,250
we had in flash or Java applets days

00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:04,450
it's more like supplemental thing so we

00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:08,180
I I think we will have regular

00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:10,280
JavaScript web application using CSS

00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:12,770
animations and grid and everything that

00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,900
be new and great things I see a this is

00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:17,240
bringing I'm sure it will have

00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:20,440
JavaScript frameworks that we love to

00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:23,660
use and then while isms gonna fit in as

00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:28,130
one component of that inside of a web

00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:31,460
application ecosystem one use case is

00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:33,230
that our team is building a wasn't what

00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:35,270
we call it was an application but you

00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:37,820
know not in the sense of whole screen

00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:40,430
was him we were building like web

00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:42,710
application that you device wasn't as a

00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:46,280
capability one thing we did as a demo

00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:50,120
was tried to make image encoder and

00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:51,710
decoder it was him so what it meant it's

00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,750
that we are building the you know old

00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:56,690
web applications that displays an image

00:30:53,750 --> 00:31:00,530
but let's say you want to support this

00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:02,810
experimental file format that no other

00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:05,570
browser supports but you still want to

00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:07,880
use it so one of the engineer on our

00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:10,220
team wrote a decoder and encoder in

00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,980
wasum we put it inside of a web

00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:16,100
application which meant that we can

00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:19,160
serve a web application with very

00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:21,050
experimental image that no other browser

00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:23,540
supports like if you drag and drop into

00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:25,970
browser it just cannot display anything

00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:29,240
but because our application hopper was a

00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:31,790
module that has decoder and encoder we

00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,220
can display those stuff so those are the

00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:36,740
kind of use case that I see that was

00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:40,240
omits going to fit into and I certainly

00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:42,530
hope not go back to that plowing days

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:48,590
another one I think that's come a

00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:52,640
comment and perhaps a little what do you

00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:55,640
call it in English word pops a little

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:58,160
like via stores because I woke with this

00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,710
team a lot is that

00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:04,220
webapplications gonna be concurrent and

00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:08,330
we start talking a lot more about web

00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:11,090
workers so I'm gonna explain what that

00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:12,890
means so we are making browsers do a lot

00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:15,799
more work now now

00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:18,980
web applications are growing we are

00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:20,480
sending a lot more data down the pipe we

00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,130
are sending a lot more JavaScript down

00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,460
the pipe although that makes a lot of

00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:28,250
people sad and a lot people happy that's

00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:30,860
a controversial topic but in the sense

00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:32,990
that like network we've been trying hard

00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:35,270
like web developers has been code

00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:39,110
splitting and then try not like Zee's a

00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:41,539
thing and trying to minimize the amount

00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:44,240
of data that we send for what it's

00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:48,220
needed for the one page browsers has

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:52,220
been working hard to make that one fast

00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:54,610
Dom or updating a UI that's also a lot

00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:57,409
of innovation happened people started to

00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:59,720
experiment with virtual Dom and doing

00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:02,000
frameworks and people are trying to like

00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:06,549
figure out the way to better manage and

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:09,230
fast do a great web interaction but

00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:11,510
result of that is that we are pushing a

00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:13,490
lot of computation into browsers so I

00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:15,230
just leave all the data processing but

00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:17,600
like it doesn't mean that we were doing

00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:20,900
machine learning or anything it's just

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,240
pure computation it's like you know some

00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:26,090
frameworks the JavaScript frameworks use

00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:30,740
a JavaScript in a client to figure out

00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:33,169
layout so that they can update the Dom

00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:35,150
element on the screen better but that

00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:37,340
means that a lot more computation is

00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:39,710
happening on the client side and a lot

00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:43,340
more javascript is happening which means

00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:46,370
it's gonna block the lending which means

00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:49,909
is that when javascript is busy

00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:51,950
calculating all of the data processing

00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:54,890
or figuring out JSON or trying to find

00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:58,970
the data in whatever the object that you

00:33:54,890 --> 00:34:00,890
have browser cannot scroll or display

00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:03,890
the animation and ultimately

00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:10,089
all the experience gets junky

00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:10,089
or kind of like this good so

00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:18,500
it's the problem and webworkers seems to

00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:22,130
be a picked up as a solution a lot of

00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:24,230
people so web worker if you've never

00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,850
tried it or heard of it you can think of

00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:28,370
it as like a two different thing a

00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:30,350
planet and the space the International

00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:33,170
Space Station I usually explain web

00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:36,080
worker as a so imagine we have a planet

00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:40,010
browser right so pregnant browser have

00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:41,690
elements that's HTML elements and the

00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:43,670
parent browser controls everything

00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:46,580
inside of it they have access to

00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:48,530
resources they can update them I'm sure

00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:51,410
they can like make ours quick and change

00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:54,110
new continent or whatever and then we

00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:58,880
can launch a another thing into space

00:34:54,110 --> 00:35:01,880
called web worker and web worker it's

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,240
still connected by network communication

00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:08,480
line to process certain scientific

00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:12,320
experiments and certain calculations but

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,900
it's detached from the main planet

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,510
browser the UI it doesn't like you know

00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,370
no matter how much computation that the

00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:21,440
web work or International Space Station

00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:24,320
is doing how great of the scientific

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,740
result is the planet browser doesn't

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:31,310
care it's not blocked by waiting for

00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:35,660
that calculations so kind of it's the

00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:39,200
way of having a thread sort of for

00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:41,240
browser so like in code you can think of

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,640
it as like new worker means launching on

00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:46,250
International Space Station and then you

00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:49,220
use postmessage api to send the data

00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:51,050
back and forth so from the your web

00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:53,510
application the main threat part you say

00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:55,970
post message with data on your web

00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:58,520
worker side of code you listen to it or

00:35:55,970 --> 00:36:03,740
message event and then they do some kind

00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:06,260
of high cost costly JavaScript execution

00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:10,130
and now once that's done then they send

00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:12,230
it back the browser receives data and

00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:17,360
then you know might update the UI or

00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:19,640
something in that way if on this part is

00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:22,480
taking you know a few seconds to learn

00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:25,090
this part on the move

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,720
thread doesn't need to be blocked by the

00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:31,720
work and that's great

00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:34,600
however using web worker presents a lot

00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:36,400
of challenges so does anyone leaning

00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,619
like programming with workers is a

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,230
actual sentence I heard I had a

00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:43,450
unconference where clone browser

00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:46,900
engineers gather to discuss their ideas

00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:49,570
and then I was kind of such a Stockholm

00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:51,609
Syndrome of web development where I was

00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:54,220
presented with this is how to do web

00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:57,690
worker and never questioned it and then

00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:59,470
this superfluous engineer who does

00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:01,810
multi-threaded programming completely

00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:04,030
differently asked me saying like do you

00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:08,080
leave you like that way I'm like now

00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:10,180
that you asked me I do not like this so

00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:13,660
there has been a lot of discussion about

00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:16,180
how can we make it make using web worker

00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:19,300
easier how can we make it so that a lot

00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:21,850
more people adopt using it so the pain

00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:25,600
point one is we don't have scheduler as

00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:27,880
a platform primitive in web platform so

00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:30,220
what that meant is that you know the

00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,170
main application still needs to start a

00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:35,260
web worker still needs to wait for that

00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:37,330
message you need to have a scheduling

00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:39,310
system or queue system or whatever the

00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:42,070
architecture is but you need to keep

00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:44,230
track of like oh I asked web worker to

00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:46,869
do this task so when that comes back

00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:49,540
then we need to do this thing those

00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:52,330
decisions right now needs to be written

00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:54,820
down in your application code and

00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:59,050
there's no like scheduling primitive in

00:37:54,820 --> 00:38:02,020
the web there was a proposal two years

00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:05,290
ago but it kind of like when told I

00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:07,000
guess but the people who is trying to

00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:09,850
make this what worker thing happen

00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
especially inside of Chrome is picking

00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:15,940
up the idea and discussing how can we

00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,700
solve this problem another pain point is

00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:21,670
passing data between worker and main

00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:23,760
thread is challenging so I explained

00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:26,109
that the main thread and worker

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,300
communicates with post message what that

00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:30,730
happens is that the main thread says

00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:33,070
like hey here's a data can you use it

00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:35,500
and then what worker says okay give me

00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:36,250
that data and they need to transfer the

00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,750
data

00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,520
there is a little bit of nuance but

00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:43,280
essentially they need to pass the data

00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:46,070
around and first time I tried to use web

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:50,450
worker even though it is supposed to

00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:53,780
make your application faster and better

00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:56,930
it became like slower because I was

00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:58,520
passing a massive canvas image and every

00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:00,380
time I do the post message I was just

00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:02,600
copying data from one Emily to the other

00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,520
memory and that took more time than

00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:07,310
actually doing the computation on the

00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:10,910
Walker thread so there is a lot of pain

00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:13,670
points going on there was a great one

00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:15,770
called shared array buffer that can kind

00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:17,150
of like be in the middle and then they

00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:19,840
can lead and write into it

00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:22,820
however was the specter and meltdown

00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:25,820
that is actually unfortunate that it's

00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:28,160
not available right now almost rousers

00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:31,450
because the shared array buffer was used

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,290
to do the spectre in a meltdown attack

00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:36,200
but if you're curious

00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:39,190
there is a article by WebKit team that

00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:42,860
says conquer in JavaScript it can work

00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:44,450
by a WebKit team that goes into how they

00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:46,700
use share or delay buffer to do the

00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:49,460
concurrent JavaScript web application

00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:51,560
work and it's fascinating to read nearly

00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:54,320
hoping that when sure doll a buffer

00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,390
comes back I can try this on and then

00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,300
another idea is that you know what if we

00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:02,780
can do stream so there is a discussion

00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:05,720
going on to have a you know listener on

00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:08,270
the main thread side so you fetch some

00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:10,370
data pipe it through you get the stream

00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:13,370
and then on a worker side you just

00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:16,340
create a transfer stream to beam the

00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:18,140
data into main thread but all of those

00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:22,430
are kind of discussion about like how

00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:25,580
can we solve this pain point the last

00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:28,250
one is that it needs more tooling so if

00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:31,100
you were familiar with web worker then

00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:33,410
you might be saying that like wow this

00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:36,880
thing existed like many many years ago

00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:41,480
why now but if you think about it Ajax

00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:45,500
happened because jquery was so great to

00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:47,690
do xhr request xhr request existed on

00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,740
what platform many many years before

00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:53,250
asia

00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:57,420
revolutions happened so I think toolings

00:40:53,250 --> 00:41:00,810
plays a lot in how we do web development

00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:02,670
and web worker is missing that my

00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:05,340
teammate soma has been kind of

00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:07,070
investigating that so he has a thing

00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,900
called comlink which is basically

00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:12,930
abstraction on top of that passing the

00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:15,090
data and sending the message and you can

00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:17,670
kind of set up your application to

00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:21,270
create a web worker and pass the message

00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:23,580
in between easier on the obstructed way

00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:26,400
and then on top of that he's building a

00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:29,730
library called communy which implements

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,700
actor model programming for using me I

00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:37,349
know I know

00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:37,770
using the web worker so those other

00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:40,980
thing

00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:45,690
I hope you got a little inspired and you

00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:47,970
contribute to doing tooling we certainly

00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:50,840
are experimenting a lot like you know as

00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:53,520
mentioned we are building what wasn't

00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:56,250
involved web application we are building

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,530
libraries using web workers and there

00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:01,230
will be a lot more coming soon from our

00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:04,140
team at a chrome but if you have any

00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:06,599
idea so any pain points or you want you

00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:08,910
have this application idea and web is

00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:11,250
lacking that kind of capabilities please

00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:14,460
please please do come talk to me we are

00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:16,380
always happy to listen I myself may not

00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,570
have answered immediately now but I

00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,510
certainly will take it to engineering

00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:23,490
team so please come talk to me and I

00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:25,640
have a stickers if you do thank you very

00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,640
