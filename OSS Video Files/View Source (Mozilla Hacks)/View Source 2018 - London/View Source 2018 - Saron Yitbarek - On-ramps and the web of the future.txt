Description: 
	It's easier than ever to learn to code. Everyone - from engineers to entrepreneurs - has access now more than ever to free and and cheap books, courses, websites to level up; no matter who you are or where you come from, you too, can learn to code. But learning to code and becoming a developer isn't simply about the existence of resources. 

In her talk about what it means to have access and on-ramps to truly become part of the code community, Saron explores the hidden barriers that exist even with all of these resources, and shares her vision for a web of the future built by making tech more accessible to all.

that justly mindful that so we're going

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,869
to focus a lot of this talk on that

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,360
first term right there the on-ramps part

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,280
one of my best friends Nadia Aden IO is

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,020
British she was born and raised in

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,939
London and she told me that on Ram's

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,520
isn't really a word that's used very

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:32,369
much in these parts I understand but

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,100
that's okay I'm here we're gonna explore

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,409
it we're gonna unpack it together and in

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,840
order to really dig into this concept of

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,869
on-ramps I need to tell you a little bit

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,990
about my childhood

00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:48,180
so I'm Ethiopian shoutout to Ethiopia

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:51,329
yeah yeah do you know that we just got

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,040
our first female president yes we did

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:55,740
doing big things ain't men

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,430
very very proud of that thank you very

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,170
much it was entirely my doing but I was

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,420
born Ethiopia came to the United States

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,240
when I was almost three years old it was

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,440
me my mommy and my daddy and when we

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:13,250
came to the US we I was raised in a very

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,440
traditional very stereotypical

00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,450
immigrant household my father was a

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,760
disciplinarian he was very strict

00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:23,780
he believed in education and actually

00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,760
that was it he just believed in

00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,770
education that was the whole thing he

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,780
believed that if you went to school and

00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,760
got good grades and as we all know the

00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,040
only good grade is an a-plus and you

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,030
went to a really good college which was

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,520
mostly Harvard he didn't know about

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,010
Oxford at the time I'm sorry and you

00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,380
picked a respectable career and the only

00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:45,500
respectable career of course is being a

00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:48,410
doctor then you would live not

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,510
necessarily a happy life but you'd be

00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:53,630
successful and that's the most important

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:56,420
thing and so anything that distracted

00:02:53,630 --> 00:03:01,040
from his very specific life plan for me

00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:04,370
was unacceptable having friends over for

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,989
fun how will you get good grades if

00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,690
you're having fun absolutely

00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:12,260
inappropriate going to people's houses

00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:14,930
for sleepovers were they're probably not

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,720
doing math homework absolutely

00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:21,260
unacceptable going to the mall

00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:24,709
where there could be boys the ultimate

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,540
distraction no way so let's just say I

00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:29,720
didn't really get out much when I was a

00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:32,750
kid in fact the people I spent the most

00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,459
time with the community that I knew was

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,440
the Ethiopian immigrant community

00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:38,780
frankly people who looked a lot like us

00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,870
and if you think about immigrant

00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,450
communities in general they tend to be a

00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,340
more vulnerable population more

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,650
vulnerable group of people these are

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,540
folks who came from a country they know

00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,850
very very well to a place that they

00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,530
probably know nothing about they usually

00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:57,440
have to learn a new language they have

00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,420
to learn new cultural norms they have to

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,959
start careers over again because those

00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:05,450
degrees do not always transfer they have

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,730
to find a new community a new place to

00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:10,900
belong and that transition is really

00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:13,670
really hard in fact if you think about

00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:17,109
that big journey between that and old

00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:20,750
world in that new world it's terrifying

00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:23,180
but people do it all the time and they

00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:26,240
do it because they believe that this new

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,139
world has opportunities that will make

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,909
their lives

00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:30,650
better and bigger and stronger and more

00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:32,930
exciting they'll be able to provide for

00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:36,710
their families better than the place

00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:40,999
where they came from but in order to do

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:42,529
that they need on ramps we like to think

00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:45,139
that if those resources and

00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:46,999
opportunities and jobs exist that that

00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:49,490
is enough but if you think about it

00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:51,590
plenty of people live or work in the

00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,999
same buildings as millionaires it's very

00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,129
P successful people and don't have

00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:56,749
access to their bank accounts right so

00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:58,159
just because the money is there the jobs

00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:59,930
are there the resources are there

00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:02,330
doesn't mean that this immigrant

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:06,620
community can tap into it they need some

00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:09,349
help and the on ramp that they found at

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:12,919
least for my community was in my mom's

00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:16,400
living room and my mom was kind of the

00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:20,870
on ramp builder that's me and my mommy

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,919
aren't we adorable I don't think she

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,469
knows that I'm using this photo and

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:28,009
putting it in all my talks but that's my

00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:30,229
mommy and that living room that she

00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:32,539
created was this magical beautiful place

00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:35,900
where all these folks could come

00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:37,250
together and help each other and at the

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,289
time you know when I was a kid I kind of

00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,210
took this for granted I figured you know

00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:43,039
okay fine people love to hang out at our

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,930
house our house was always the place to

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,639
be from when I was a kid to even now

00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,469
when I go back to the east coast to

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,629
visit family that's always where they

00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:52,189
tend to gather and as a kid I didn't

00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:54,909
really appreciate that I thought well my

00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:57,649
mom's a nice lady she cooks good food

00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:59,659
has comfortable couches so why wouldn't

00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:02,020
you want to hang out with us but if I

00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:04,490
look at that do the ones of an adult

00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,740
it's actually very interesting because

00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,830
there were plenty of people in our

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,659
community who had bigger living rooms

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,879
who had people who could also cook very

00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:15,770
well who had more money more resources

00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:19,399
than we did so why did people keep

00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:22,969
coming back to our living room what made

00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:24,710
our living room so special there were a

00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:25,520
few things did you see that coming there

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,229
gonna be a few things that made it

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,210
special okay so we're gonna talk about

00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:30,889
this idea of a living room on ramp what

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,949
does that look like there are a couple

00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:35,360
things that my mom did that now I see

00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:36,440
was very intentional back then I didn't

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,219
really appreciate and I want to walk

00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,259
through them with you

00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:40,199
the first is she had this principal

00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:42,029
uneven of she really

00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,639
realizes she has this principle of first

00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:46,830
to serve and last eat she was the one

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,509
running around making sure your plates

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,029
were full your cups were full that you

00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:53,400
were happy and full just being full is

00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:55,169
very important in my culture and she

00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,550
would be running around and making sure

00:06:55,169 --> 00:07:01,349
that happened and she rarely took a

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:03,779
break and in doing so she made you feel

00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:07,080
like you were the most important person

00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:10,409
in the room she made you feel like your

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,759
needs mattered and in that community

00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:12,960
that vulnerable community where you're

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,370
in this new place and you don't always

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,620
feel like you belong and you don't know

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:20,419
if people even care about you even want

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:22,860
you there that feeling is so important

00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:25,770
the second thing she did was she led by

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,960
observing she wasn't the kind of host to

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:29,339
you know clink the champagne glass and

00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,770
make a big fancy announcement it was

00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:33,210
really her thing she'd quietly look

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,370
around make sure everything was going

00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,080
well and if she spotted a problem she'd

00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,740
run and solve it but she wouldn't make a

00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,990
fuss about it

00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,430
she looked at your plate and she'd see

00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:43,560
that you didn't actually eat one of your

00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,849
dishes and she'd come up to you and

00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,099
she'd say why didn't you eat that and

00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:49,680
you'll go oh it's too spicy you don't

00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:52,979
really do heat very well and she'd go

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,379
okay and the next time you came over

00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:58,139
she'd make a little row of dishes just

00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:00,270
for you and they'd be the non spicy

00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,469
versions of what everyone else ate it

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,370
would it be a big deal she wouldn't make

00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:03,839
a big fuss about it

00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:07,259
but she'd call you over and she'd say

00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:11,159
you see those those are for you because

00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:13,229
your problems mattered to her even if it

00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:15,210
took her an extra hour to to whip up the

00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:17,370
same dishes just a different variety she

00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:19,319
would do it and she would do it because

00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:22,879
she watched she took a step back she

00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:25,469
watched she observed and she responded

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,939
the last thing that she did that I

00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:29,189
really appreciate is she would solve

00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:31,439
these little problems these many little

00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:35,159
problems and my favorite example of this

00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,180
was a few years ago on Thanksgiving now

00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,680
I don't know how much y'all know about

00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,810
Thanksgiving in American Thanksgiving

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,940
what that's all about but we have turkey

00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:44,639
and mashed potatoes and mac and cheese

00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,319
and that's a very American thing in

00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,260
Ethiopian cuisine that's not really what

00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:52,500
we eat we do a lot of stews and mostly

00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,700
actually vegan dishes and so this one

00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,080
Thanksgiving though

00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,230
had a lot of that traditional food

00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:01,830
mostly for the kids and we forgot the

00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,750
gravy okay you all need to be a little

00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,190
bit more panicked about this okay we

00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,740
forgot the gravy you can't have

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,120
Thanksgiving without gravy and I said to

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,680
my mom I said oh my goodness mom we

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,660
forgot to go what are we gonna do

00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,280
and I'm thinking or the grocery stores

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,930
even open at this point or we gonna have

00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,670
to go to the gas station and get gas

00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,250
station gravy oh that's the worst kind

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:22,500
of gravy what are we gonna do and she

00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,900
says don't worry I'll figure it out and

00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,660
while everyone's standing watching her

00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:30,030
surrounding her in the kitchen she grabs

00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,100
some flour and some spices and some

00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:35,340
turkey juice is that how you make gravy

00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:38,070
I wasn't recipe and she whips together

00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:40,980
the most delicious gravy you've ever had

00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:43,350
and this may not seem like a big deal to

00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:46,140
you but we don't do gravy

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:49,140
we don't do flour spiced chicken juice

00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:51,120
sauces like that's our thing our sauces

00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,490
are made with a lot of onions and a lot

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,530
of spices so the idea that this

00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,540
Ethiopian immigrant woman figured out

00:09:55,530 --> 00:10:00,570
how to make gravy out of nowhere while

00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:03,240
everyone is watching on Thanksgiving was

00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,380
this amazing little way of her finding a

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,180
problem seeing a problem and just

00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,640
getting to work rolling up her sleeves

00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:13,740
and figuring it out and in doing so she

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:15,180
saved Thanksgiving so if we abstract the

00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,250
steps involved in some of the examples

00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,110
that I gave we will begin to see a

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,510
little bit of a loop she does this thing

00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,690
where she understands her community she

00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:26,760
knows what we need she builds something

00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:29,040
whether it's turkey juice gravy or

00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,680
whatever it may be she learns she takes

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,030
a step back she observes and then she

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,120
sees that there's something not quite

00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:39,150
right and then she writes she addresses

00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,710
it do these steps look familiar you're

00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,900
all tech people so I really hope they

00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:45,060
look familiar right these are like steps

00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,470
involved in product development she

00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,200
basically does product development but

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:53,280
for people and humans and communities

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,570
but it's the same type of steps but in

00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,280
the beginning I told you that this talk

00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,440
was gonna be about on-ramp so how is

00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,770
this an on-ramp how is this idea that

00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,750
creating spaces where you feel safe and

00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:07,139
welcomed and wanted how is that an

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,730
on-ramp it's only when you're

00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:11,160
in this environment it's only when

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,829
you're in this place where you feel safe

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,309
and welcome and wanted you're

00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:18,389
comfortable asking questions where

00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:21,480
you're comfortable raising your hand and

00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:24,559
saying hey I need a job and I really

00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,480
have many skills could you help me out

00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,579
it's only when you feel safe and

00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,529
welcomed and wanted then you raise your

00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:33,169
hand and go oh I have a job I have a

00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:35,309
connection I have a resource for you

00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:37,319
it's only then when you say man I'm

00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:40,259
struggling with this problem I don't

00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:42,509
know how to fix it can you help me you

00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:45,359
need these environments these living

00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:47,489
rooms these places because that's where

00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:49,889
those connections happen that's where

00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:52,829
those resources that seem oftentimes

00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:55,889
locked away and inaccessible that's when

00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:59,549
you can get to them because communities

00:11:55,889 --> 00:12:02,220
are on ramps a lot of the ways we get to

00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:03,899
those opportunities we get those jobs we

00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,540
solve our problems we move forward in

00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:09,949
our careers in our lives a lot of those

00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:13,139
events those interactions happen in

00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:17,480
communities communities are essential in

00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:19,649
unlocking the opportunities that exist

00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,350
fast-forward a few years later I am now

00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:24,119
an adult I am all grown up and I've

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,129
decided that I want to learn to code and

00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:27,839
for me learning to code looked a lot

00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:29,279
like this because you turn into a

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,360
cartoon when you learn to code I think I

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,299
thank you all you've all been through

00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,309
that process right and so when I learned

00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:38,129
to code I learned on my own for a few

00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:40,470
months and it was hard it was so hard it

00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:41,910
was so frustrating because it's you

00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:46,470
versus the computer and the computer is

00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:49,860
always right you know and it was so so

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:51,329
painful but it was just fun enough and

00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,860
just exciting enough that I kept pushing

00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:54,449
through and kept pushing through and

00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,189
then after a few months of that I

00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:58,350
decided to enroll into a boot camp

00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:59,699
called the Flatiron school based in one

00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:03,359
other a few campuses based in New York

00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:06,419
City and when I went to this boot camp

00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:08,579
all of a sudden I had a group of 44

00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:11,249
other people who understood the highs

00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:13,799
and the lows who understood what it felt

00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:16,759
like when nothing worked and how awesome

00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:20,100
it was when things finally clicked and

00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:20,769
having that community

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,509
was such an

00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:25,720
important part in me being able to push

00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:27,069
through and graduate when I graduated I

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,329
was so excited they make you click your

00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:30,489
heels three times in order to become

00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:31,869
like a full developer and I was so

00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:32,649
excited when I graduated and I thought

00:13:31,869 --> 00:13:35,559
yes

00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:38,619
finally I'm here I have arrived I can

00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:40,509
get a Jo B it's gonna be great but

00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:44,379
getting to that point crossing that

00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:47,679
finish line for me cost eleven thousand

00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:49,389
dollars out-of-pocket there's no student

00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,249
loans right for bootcamps it's an

00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:53,499
unaccredited institution

00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:55,449
technically and many months without a

00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,980
salary because this is full-time and

00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:59,079
full-time isn't really forty hours it's

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,339
more like sixty two you know two ninety

00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:03,929
depending on how dedicated you are and

00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:05,679
so many many months without a salary and

00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:08,799
here's the thing that's so interesting

00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:11,139
about a bootcamp that opportunity exists

00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:15,309
the information that boot camps teach

00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:17,860
are out in the world it's not a question

00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:19,689
of the resources not being there but

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:25,149
it's happened to them to get one of

00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:28,179
those seats cost that so here's what I

00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:30,939
knew I knew that for me the key to that

00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:32,350
boot camp experience wasn't exactly the

00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:33,970
curriculum and the resources although

00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,399
those were good - for me it was all

00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,410
about community community was the key

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,949
but it was also the thing that was most

00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:43,929
inaccessible but don't worry I'm here

00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:47,049
I'm gonna fix it I'm gonna do something

00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:48,519
about it so I decided to build the code

00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:50,259
to be Twitter chat show of hands if you

00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:52,209
know what a Twitter chat is raise them

00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:54,040
high raise em high reason I raise em

00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:56,619
high really okay don't where I'm educate

00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,929
you don't worry I got you no problem so

00:14:56,619 --> 00:15:00,939
a Twitter chat is when you use a hashtag

00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:02,920
for us we use the hashtag code newbie

00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:05,169
and you pick a time so for us is

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,129
Wednesday night 6 p.m. Pacific time 9:00

00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:09,549
p.m. Eastern Time

00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:11,470
and you pick a topic so might be you

00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:13,569
know your favorite coding resources or a

00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,949
side projects or how to learn on the job

00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:17,799
was one that we did a couple days ago

00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:20,980
actually and the moderator which was me

00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:23,049
would tweet out questions and get people

00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,669
to respond using the hashtag so you use

00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:27,100
that hashtag to keep track of the

00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:30,730
conversation and it was a really really

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,769
great way of joining at a particular

00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,360
time and really being part of one single

00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:37,149
conversation

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,130
so how do you make a Twitter chat on

00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:40,570
ramp because Twitter chats especially

00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,220
back in the day this is about four or

00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,350
five years ago we're pretty popular a

00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,089
lot of people had Twitter chats for many

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,380
many different topics technical

00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:49,360
non-technical lots of different things

00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:52,329
so how do you make one that's specific

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,610
and can be used as an on-ramp well there

00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:57,070
are a couple things that we did remember

00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:59,740
one is we had our three rules rules are

00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,930
awesome rules are very important our

00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:04,420
rules were be helpful be supportive be

00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,820
nice and the idea behind having these

00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:09,070
three rules was to say before you walk

00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,589
in the door before you enter our living

00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:13,570
room you need to know how to behave and

00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:16,390
you need to know what kind of behavior

00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:19,899
will be tolerated here and you need to

00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:22,390
know what behavior you can expect so

00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:23,680
when you walk in you know that you're

00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,990
gonna get a helpful environment we've

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,660
stated that we've promised you that it's

00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:31,450
a public commitment as well as setting

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:33,490
expectations right at the beginning the

00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,860
other thing that we did and this is the

00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:40,420
big one this is very very important we

00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:41,829
were really really nice in fact we were

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:45,399
aggressively nice

00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:48,850
we were disgustingly nice we were so

00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:53,140
nice that if you're not nice you'll hate

00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:55,779
us and I'm okay with that I am here's

00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,399
the thing about inclusion when you say

00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:59,110
the word inclusion it sounds like you

00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:01,180
want everybody to be part of the group

00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,040
you don't really want everybody to be

00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,569
part of the group you know you want to

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,559
leave out some of the bad apples you

00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:07,449
want to leave out the people who are

00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:09,339
just gonna be toxic right you you kind

00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:11,130
of want to weed them out and our way of

00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:14,919
weeding people out was being

00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:19,000
disgustingly aggressively nice let me

00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:21,640
show you how bad it was this was the two

00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,699
three years ago I think it was and it

00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,049
was Wednesday night was that time and

00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:28,419
that day early in the morning I had this

00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:30,130
terrible pain in my right shoulder was

00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:32,230
terrible pain and it was steadily

00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:34,120
increasing throughout the day and I

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,530
thought to myself oh man I hope I hope

00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,020
this goes away by the time our chat

00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:41,049
comes around two minutes before the

00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:43,330
Twitter chat happens and it gets so bad

00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:46,120
I can't lift my arm anymore I can't even

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:49,270
move my arm and I'm

00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,100
and screaming in pain and my poor

00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:56,400
husband who's right there by the way hey

00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:59,590
husband how you doing oh just so cute

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,150
and so I said I said to my poor husband

00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,950
I said it's Twitter chat time and he

00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,510
goes I think we should go to the

00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,919
emergency room I got your you're crying

00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,460
you can't move your arm that sounds like

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,140
a problem

00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:12,580
maybe we should address that and I said

00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:14,860
no it's time for the Twitter chat and so

00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,480
I said I'm gonna dictate and you are

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,580
going to type it's gonna be great it's

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,600
gonna work out on the thing about our

00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,340
Twitter account if you look at our

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,720
interests if you look at our code nummy

00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,210
Twitter account versus my personal one

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,500
it's very different personalities the

00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,750
good on me Twitter account is full of

00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:31,090
exclamation points and hearts and emojis

00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,860
and we celebrate you to the point of

00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,929
exhaustion I mean you we want you to

00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,570
feel like you were the most magical

00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:39,760
human being that ever existed well you

00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:42,850
feel super super special and I didn't

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,880
see it in that way until I had to tell

00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:47,679
my husband what to tweet and so we you

00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,240
know he'd tweet something I go there's

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,010
none of exclamation points we need a

00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,419
minimum of three exclamation that's how

00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,010
I sound when I tweet yeah that's that's

00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:55,630
the voice that comes out and I said

00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,250
minimum three exclamation points there's

00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:00,010
not enough heart emojis why aren't there

00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:01,510
more heart emojis and you know a Emily

00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,399
will tweet and say I made my first pull

00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:05,230
requests on my congratulate Emily you

00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:09,340
know it's just it was it was intense it

00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:11,830
was very and there you know there comes

00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:13,450
a time in your life when you you find

00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:16,720
yourself screaming emojis that the

00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:18,880
person you love that you you you realize

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,460
how seriously you you take the work that

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,559
you do the community work that you do

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:27,250
but it's helped it's helped people who

00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:29,140
don't have that who don't feel the need

00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,880
to be aggressively nice it repels them

00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,919
it actually does we're a little too much

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,020
we're doing too much and that is fine

00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:37,510
and the other thing it does it attracts

00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,950
people who need that the people who want

00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,750
to be aggressively nice the people who

00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:43,390
want to shower you with compliments they

00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,520
want to hang out with us and in doing so

00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,890
you end up with this really warm

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:51,270
community of people who are super

00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:53,529
supportive and really really kind so

00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,580
because of this chat it's going really

00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:56,110
really well thewhat you can't really

00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:59,250
read it but trust me it's nice things

00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:01,140
and this Twitter chat serves as an

00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,120
an amazing on-ramp people are finding

00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,470
mentors there hearing about books they

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,720
never heard of before people have gotten

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:09,360
jobs through the Twitter chats it's been

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,710
a really great way to connect the world

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,350
they were coming from which is usually a

00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:16,380
non-technical place and helping them get

00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,110
to this new world of being in our case a

00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,330
developer being technical

00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:23,820
now once the chart the chart the chat

00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,260
started picking up I started to get some

00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,510
messages start to get some DMS from

00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,920
people who said man this is really great

00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:33,510
I love what you're doing I'd love to

00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:35,970
join but I'm not in your time zone where

00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:37,170
you are it's it at the time of the chat

00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,670
for me it's four o'clock in the morning

00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:40,230
or at seven o'clock in the morning I

00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,210
mean getting the kids ready for school I

00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:44,190
want to participate but I can't what can

00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:47,070
you do and that's when I learned that

00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:49,410
chat organizers and technical folks have

00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:52,620
another thing in common we both hate

00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:54,720
time zones time zones are horrible and

00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,920
they continue to be horrible and this is

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,200
a really tricky problem because I can't

00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,030
be awake at all hours right I can't have

00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,060
a chat for every single time zone I do

00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:05,670
have a job so how do you how do you

00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,590
solve for this well we learned this

00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:09,900
lesson and we iterated by doing another

00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:13,290
chat a morning chat we do chats on

00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,640
Sundays at 11 a.m. Pacific time and that

00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,710
one's more of a coding check and it's an

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,750
opportunity to for you to be accountable

00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,950
to us to yourself and say hey this is

00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,840
what I did last week this is what I'm

00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:24,000
gonna do this week and it's been a nice

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,400
alternative for people who can't make

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,200
the evening chats but here's the thing

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,460
if those people hadn't spoken up if they

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,670
hadn't raised their hand and said hey

00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:39,830
this is great but it doesn't work for me

00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:42,210
we would not have Sunday morning chats

00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:45,390
so everything is going great the chats

00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:48,150
going amazingly but Twitter's not a

00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,980
great place to have a long conversation

00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:53,760
you can try but you probably end up just

00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,290
pissed but it's a great place to meet a

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,520
lot of people in a very short amount of

00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,630
time to have a lot of different

00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,730
conversations in a short amount of time

00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:02,700
it's efficient but it's not a great way

00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:04,410
of digging deeper so I started to think

00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,500
about a different medium what's a better

00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:08,850
medium for exploring and my first job

00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,700
out of college was actually working at

00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:13,020
NPR and I thought podcasts podcast a

00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,630
really great medium to just

00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:17,970
focus on one person one topic one

00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:21,570
journey and to really dig in and dig

00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:23,430
deep but when I looked at the landscape

00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:26,430
of podcast specifically technical

00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:28,680
podcasts this is what I learned there

00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:31,260
are lots of technical content out there

00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,810
but there are few technical stories and

00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:35,940
the thing about technical content is

00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:38,580
there's tons of stuff if you're already

00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:42,180
a developer no matter what language

00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:45,120
you're you work in there's stuff for you

00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:47,850
and if you know that context a bit it's

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,980
hugely valuable but if you're just

00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:53,690
getting started a lot of those

00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,560
conversations are just too too technical

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,710
they're a little bit too in the weeds

00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:01,340
are just out of reach so even though

00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:04,530
they're amazing resources that exist

00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:09,060
from my community for new developers

00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:12,000
they're not necessarily accessible but I

00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:14,220
have no fear because I am here I decided

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,570
to build the economy Twitter chat that

00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,300
was gonna be my way of solving that

00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:21,330
problem but how do you build a podcast

00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:24,090
as an on-ramp how do you do it with the

00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:26,460
intention of it making this world this

00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:29,060
new world of technology accessible to

00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,830
more people well there are a few things

00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,570
one of the things that I knew very very

00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:36,060
well about our community is that they

00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:38,850
need validation specifically that they

00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:41,190
belong in tech there are generally two

00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:43,800
narratives two dominant narratives of

00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:46,110
how you become technical you either

00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,520
learn computer science in school we have

00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:49,500
a computer science degree you went to

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,720
probably a top 10 University worked at a

00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,430
Mozilla or Microsoft or Google right out

00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,900
of college and you launched your career

00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:58,800
and it'll never stop you're amazing or

00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,090
you've been coding since you were two

00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,850
right those are kind of the only two

00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:05,190
options and the interesting thing is in

00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,900
interviewing at Tom the developers over

00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,040
the years I realized that most people

00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,650
don't fall into either of these

00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,360
categories they have their own load map

00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:15,360
their own journey of how they got there

00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,400
and so what I wanted to do with this

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,530
show to make sure this podcast was an

00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,070
on-ramp was to show people from

00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:25,980
different backgrounds different places

00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,800
different experiences and create a new

00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,920
narrative that's

00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:33,370
as well but there is no narrative but if

00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:35,080
you want to be here you can so these are

00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:36,820
this is a snapshot of some of the

00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,440
wonderful people we've had on the show

00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,660
some amazing people we've had on the

00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,760
show and I love about this group of

00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,590
people is they really do come from every

00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,900
different background different places in

00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:48,550
the world different studies we have

00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:51,070
people who used to be teachers used to

00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:53,680
be truck drivers used to be I think it

00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:58,240
was Chad Fowler who used to be a

00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:59,650
saxophonist well and this has been a

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,950
really really important part of making

00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:04,990
sure that podcast is an on-ramp the

00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:08,320
other thing is they need a validation

00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:10,450
that they can do this that is probably

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,390
the biggest barrier for new developers

00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:15,880
it's not really resources it's not the

00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:19,080
education it's not the job interview

00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:22,390
it's believing that they can do it and

00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:24,970
this is absolutely huge and the way that

00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:26,710
I solve this is is actually very subtle

00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:29,650
it's nothing nothing big nothing huge

00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:31,090
but I think it's really important if you

00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:33,790
listen to podcasts specially technical

00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:37,690
one more than likely a guest will

00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:39,280
mention a word jargon buzzword that is

00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,500
technical that some that the audience

00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:44,200
may not know may not know may not know

00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:46,360
what it is and the host will usually say

00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,490
something like this can you define what

00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:52,210
that word is for people who may not know

00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:55,230
and that sounds nice that sounds

00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:58,870
thoughtful but really what you're saying

00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:01,750
when you phrase it that way is I know

00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:04,570
what that word is you know what that

00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:06,430
word is people listening should know

00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:07,450
what that word is but there's a couple

00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:10,260
of them who probably don't know what

00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:13,600
that word is could you help them out

00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:15,400
it's a very teeny little jab it's a

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,560
little paper cut it's a little

00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,830
itty-bitty reminder that oh I should

00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:23,130
know what that is so what I do in my

00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:25,750
show is I pretend not to know anything

00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,950
I'll say I don't know what that word is

00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,800
can you explain that to me

00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:31,330
and it's funny because sometimes I'll

00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,070
get texts from friends who listen to the

00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:35,740
podcast and they'll go I know you know

00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:39,370
what that is and I'm like yes I do but

00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:40,630
my job is to be the audience it's to get

00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:43,540
out of the way and really be

00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:46,660
them and to be their voice and in Little

00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:48,220
Italy things like that you validate that

00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,440
hey if I don't know it and I'm the host

00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,500
of this thing it's totally ok if you

00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,890
don't and we're gonna learn together and

00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:58,840
the last thing that I try to focus on is

00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:01,360
me getting out of the way this is huge

00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:04,060
this is super super important for a

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,540
podcast to really be an on-ramp I need

00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:09,280
to kind of be invisible on my own show

00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:12,670
and what I do to make sure this happens

00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,080
is I try and focus the interview

00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:17,830
entirely on the guest and I'm gonna

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,690
prove this to you this is whether you

00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:22,030
can see it but that top track these are

00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,740
the audio files to the podcast this is

00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:25,600
episode 111 the baratunde thurston who's

00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,920
a comedian and technologist he's awesome

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,460
had a really great interview tiller

00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:32,800
check it out that top track is me that's

00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:35,200
my voice and that bottom in the purple

00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,750
is bear tunde's and as you can see I

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,690
don't really talk a lot I'd only say a

00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:43,750
lot in fact most of those audio waves

00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:48,780
aren't even me asking questions they're

00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:51,100
me going mm-hmm and mm-hmm

00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:54,790
those are my cue my to go to sound

00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:56,500
effect that's that's 90% of the job of

00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:58,360
an interviewer those two if you get if

00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:01,660
you nailed those two you got this you

00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:04,090
can do this too but my job is to get out

00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:06,760
of the way this show is not about me it

00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:08,860
is for you and I'm gonna do another one

00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,690
this one is Kevin Scott CTO of Microsoft

00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,920
and the same thing I think Kevin talks

00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:13,920
to me a little bit more than bear Tunde

00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,480
but same thing right that top audio

00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,700
audio track is me don't really say much

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,980
and Kevin really really takes the stage

00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,650
and that's his job his role is to take

00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:24,940
up space because he's the one with the

00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:26,590
resources and the knowledge and the

00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:28,870
opportunities and the stories that are

00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:31,720
gonna make those resources accessible to

00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:35,410
my audience I don't have that he does he

00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:37,930
deserves that stage things are going

00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:39,790
great again amazing nice tweets I

00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:42,100
promise things have gone great in the

00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:44,110
podcast is is wonderful people telling

00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,060
you they're finding motivation by

00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:48,340
listening to this they're using it to

00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:50,110
help them on really tough days they're

00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,730
hearing about jobs they've never heard

00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:53,420
of before job titles and now they're

00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,040
gonna investigate they're hearing

00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,380
about companies and people they're gonna

00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,000
reach out to and they're really really

00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,250
helping them get from this old world

00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,540
that they came from to this new world

00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:07,640
that they're trying to get into but then

00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:09,620
this happened wait another show that we

00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,170
launched called the base es podcast

00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,720
about a year ago we are just recording

00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:16,580
our fourth season and the busiest

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,950
podcast the idea behind this is

00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:21,590
specifically to make computer science

00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:24,350
education accessible now the computer

00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:27,980
science is pretty tough and it's really

00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:29,600
hard to understand it if you don't have

00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,760
a computer science degree if you're

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,730
trying to learn that content outside of

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:37,040
a degree program it's it's tough there's

00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:38,450
not a lot of there's not like a code

00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,130
Academy for computer science right

00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:43,430
there's not a lot of resources and ways

00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:45,680
to to learn that on your own and so I

00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:48,110
teamed up with an amazing woman named

00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,550
vitae hee Joshi and she for a year

00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:51,590
decided that she didn't have a computer

00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:54,440
science degree either and she said that

00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:56,900
she was going to teach herself so she

00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:00,200
did a bunch of research and she wrote

00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:01,790
one blog post a week for a year and it

00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,950
was amazing was beautiful she lots of

00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:05,540
graphics who's gorgeous and I looked at

00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:08,510
that and I saw and I thought yes this

00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:09,710
would be a great podcast I'm gonna be

00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:11,330
the student she's gonna be the teacher

00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:13,190
I'm gonna ask all the questions she'll

00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:16,280
have all the answers and it'll be a

00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:18,770
great way in short 20 minute episodes of

00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:20,930
making that education feel more

00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:24,770
accessible show of hands if you've heard

00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:26,210
of the show car talk on NPR okay so if

00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:28,490
you heard of that show someone recently

00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:30,410
described the bass es podcast as Car

00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:32,420
Talk but for computer science and that

00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:34,490
is very accurate it's just us making a

00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:36,650
lot of bad puns and jokes and being

00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:39,230
really just nerdy and geeky and silly

00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:42,050
but still teaching you things so there

00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:43,690
you go now this show was going great and

00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:46,010
I think it was after the first season

00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:49,730
that I got an email from one of our

00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:52,010
listeners and this listener said thank

00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:53,800
you so so much for making the show it

00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:58,670
was wonderful it's helped me so much

00:30:53,800 --> 00:31:00,410
because I'm blind and a lot of the

00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:03,100
education out there a lot of the

00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:05,480
material for computer science is visual

00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,630
there's just not a lot of stuff that I

00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,580
can consume

00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,380
and this is a great way for me to

00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,240
finally understand a lot of the content

00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:15,150
that I haven't been able to understand

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:18,450
so far and I read that and I thought oh

00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:19,860
my goodness that wasn't my intention I

00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:23,580
wasn't thinking about accessibility in

00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:27,650
that way but that's great but what that

00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:32,160
made me wonder was who am i leaving out

00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:34,680
in the fact that I picked podcasting as

00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:38,900
the medium what happens if you can't

00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:41,340
hear what am i doing for those folks and

00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,950
that's just something that until that

00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,510
email I didn't think about and it was

00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,680
the first time that I thought of these

00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,360
shows that at this point I've been doing

00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,670
for years through the lens of

00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:54,540
accessibility what are we doing to make

00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:57,480
this more accessible for folks and we

00:31:54,540 --> 00:32:00,090
decided to do was we iterated and we did

00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,010
transcripts so now we transcribe all of

00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:04,230
our episodes for the codeme podcast and

00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:08,190
for the basest podcast but here's the

00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:08,610
thing if that one listener hadn't spoken

00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:12,420
up

00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:15,600
if he hadn't sent me that email we would

00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:20,610
not have transcripts I didn't think of

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:22,230
that he did so far we talked about three

00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:23,970
projects three different on-ramps the

00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:25,650
basis podcast company podcast and the

00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:27,570
couldn't be Twitter chat and all of

00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:29,370
these are online which is great right

00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:31,560
more people can join in more people can

00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:33,930
take part we can make that on-ramp

00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,520
bigger and sturdier and wider and have

00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:37,860
even more people on it helping them get

00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:41,730
from one world to another but the thing

00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:44,670
is situations like this meetups events

00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:48,090
like this conferences like this super

00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:50,520
important they are a huge part of my

00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:52,260
career professionally personally they've

00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:55,620
been an important way for me to meet

00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,790
amazing people to get job opportunities

00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:00,060
to make friends

00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:01,920
and so this IRL write this in real life

00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:04,050
component was huge and something that we

00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,280
hadn't addressed but for all the

00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:07,020
speaking that I've done in conference

00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,930
attending that I've done one thing I

00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:12,990
understood is that most conferences just

00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:15,570
aren't great for newbies they don't

00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:17,730
serve as on-ramps for them and the

00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:20,370
interesting thing about conferences is

00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:23,100
that technically anybody

00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:24,690
go right you don't have to like apply to

00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,980
go to a conference you as long as you

00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:27,930
can pay for the ticket and take the days

00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,640
off then you're there so it's

00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:33,720
technically you know the fact that it

00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:37,440
exists is great and is very valuable but

00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:40,320
just because it exists doesn't mean that

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,080
a lot of people can access it but once

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,630
again have no fear I am here and I've

00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:47,340
decided that I'm going to build the

00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:49,260
conference for new developers it's gonna

00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:52,320
be called code land it's gonna be

00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:56,670
amazing but how do you build a

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:59,100
conference as an on-ramp how do you make

00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:01,590
that the thing that bridges these two

00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:04,350
worlds well there are a couple things

00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:06,390
number one for our community especially

00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:08,370
is when you go to a conference you

00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:10,169
ideally would like to follow and

00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:11,780
understand the talks that seems kind of

00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:13,649
like a no-brainer right an obvious one

00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:16,040
but here's the thing about technical

00:34:13,649 --> 00:34:18,629
conferences they're really technical

00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:20,159
even the ones that are that the talks

00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:23,129
that are labeled beginner friendly or

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:27,060
newbie friendly aren't actually beginner

00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:29,730
friendly they're beginner to this

00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:31,350
technology friendly right not beginner

00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:34,590
to tech friendly and those are very

00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:37,919
different because as you all know that

00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:40,230
very first language tool framework that

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,669
you learned that's the hard one that's

00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,860
the really tough one because at that

00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:46,590
point you don't know how to navigate

00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:48,600
Docs yet you haven't learned that you do

00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:51,330
need to read the error message some of

00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,950
you are still learning that you don't

00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:56,429
quite know when it's okay to ask for

00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:59,330
help you haven't built up your toolkit

00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:03,180
your personal support ecosystem to know

00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:05,190
how to learn efficiently you hit a

00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:07,980
roadblock and you think oh my goodness I

00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:10,410
think I'm just stupid it's me I'm the

00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,140
idiot but once you get that first

00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:14,700
language that first framework that first

00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:17,100
technology down the second one is a lot

00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:20,340
easier you know that you're gonna hit a

00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,720
wall a couple hundred times that's not

00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,390
you being stupid that's just the process

00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:27,030
of learning something technical so that

00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:28,800
second time is way easier but what

00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:30,359
happens for my community for new

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,460
developers as they'll sit in that talk

00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:32,650
there they'll hear that one word that

00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,359
there

00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:37,000
them off and they'll go oh my goodness

00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:38,980
I'm never gonna get this and they get

00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,440
overwhelmed they get frustrated and they

00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:43,539
check out so being able to follow and

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,880
understand the talks is super important

00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:48,309
so what we did to address this as we

00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,170
created these conference booklets on

00:35:48,309 --> 00:35:52,299
flow paddle these booklets oh they're so

00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:54,490
good they're about a hundred pages and

00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:57,099
what I asked all the speakers to do as I

00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:59,200
said please send me two things send me a

00:35:57,099 --> 00:36:00,460
list of resources so people can learn

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,250
more about the thing you're talking

00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:07,089
about and send me a list of terms and

00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:09,279
definitions that way if I'm a new person

00:36:07,089 --> 00:36:10,510
news that topic and I'm sitting in the

00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:12,940
audience and you mentioned a word that I

00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:15,220
don't know I can quickly look it up read

00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:18,609
the definition and follow along and keep

00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:21,400
up and it's been incredibly helpful way

00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:25,029
of making sure that the content of these

00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:27,279
talks is accessible to more people the

00:36:25,029 --> 00:36:29,770
second thing is that newbies really need

00:36:27,279 --> 00:36:33,160
to learn why I think once you get

00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:34,450
comfortable in being technical you kind

00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,160
of forget about the why a little bit you

00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:38,740
get so excited about the implementation

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,660
you get excited about how it works then

00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:42,490
you forget about what why am i doing it

00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,750
and where am I doing it and who uses it

00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,859
and what are the side effects and what

00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,119
are the questions I need to answer and

00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:48,849
you kind of forget about that world

00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:51,819
around the technology but for new

00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:54,309
developers that why that context is huge

00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:55,960
a lot of people get into this because

00:36:54,309 --> 00:36:58,270
they're excited about the ideas they can

00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,730
bring to life they're excited about the

00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:02,289
problems in their own lives in their own

00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:04,240
neighborhoods their own communities that

00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:07,770
they can solve with these technical

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:10,930
skills so to them that why that context

00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:12,369
super important sometimes it's more

00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:15,369
important than the technical

00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:17,740
implementation so to help address this

00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:19,420
for our conference I personally work

00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:21,039
with every single speaker I think I

00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:24,339
averaged about four hours per speaker

00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:26,380
across two conferences about 80 to 100

00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:28,240
speakers and I personally work with

00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,900
people on the outline of their talks

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:34,599
their slides their actual presentation

00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:36,910
to make sure that this Y was covered to

00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:41,200
make sure that their talks would connect

00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:42,910
with our audience and the last thing the

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,799
last thing that we need for our

00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:45,790
conference to make sure it's a solid

00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:48,660
on-ramp and this one is

00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:52,360
huge is we need to make it financially

00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:53,770
accessible and a lot of conference

00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,140
attendees take this for granted there's

00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:57,700
a lot of us have companies that'll pay

00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,400
for that ticket or pay for that hotel or

00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:03,340
at least heavily subsidized events like

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,040
this but for new developers we're not

00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:07,870
there yet new developers are hoping to

00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,430
have that job with the professional

00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:10,870
development budget they're hoping to get

00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:13,000
to that place where there's an education

00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:15,760
budget but they're not there yet they're

00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,850
still working as waiters as teachers as

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,670
secretaries hoping to one day be in

00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:24,400
seats like this and so for them going to

00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:26,830
a conference isn't just about using some

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,570
vacation days a lot of times it's taking

00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:32,050
days off that they won't ever get paid

00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:34,570
for it's paying for the conference

00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:38,350
ticket itself which can be anywhere from

00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:39,880
hundreds to thousands of dollars it's

00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:41,230
paying for the hotel because a lot of

00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,270
these conferences are in major cities

00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:45,100
and if you're not in a major city

00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:47,050
because major cities are very expensive

00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,330
to live in well then now you have to pay

00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:53,740
for three nights hotel have to pay for a

00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:56,410
flight to get there so that conference

00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:58,930
that thing that could be an on-ramp that

00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:01,150
could be helpful in your career to your

00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:02,680
professional development is an

00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:06,310
investment worth thousands of dollars

00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:08,440
literally that makes it really really

00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:10,390
tough for people who are trying to break

00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:13,420
in who are trying to go from that old

00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:14,860
world to this new world so what we did

00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,440
to help this as we created an

00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:18,580
opportunity scholarship and there are

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,410
lots of conferences that do things like

00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,850
diversity scholarships and usually it

00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:24,040
means that you get a free ticket which

00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:27,190
is wonderful that's a very very great

00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,450
way to lower that barrier but a lot of

00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,950
times the thing that makes it an

00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,210
accessible isn't really the ticket

00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:34,690
sometimes the tickets the cheapest part

00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:36,850
it's all that other stuff so we created

00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:39,130
an opportunity scholarship that covered

00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:41,020
any expenses that you need for you to

00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:42,310
attend the conference and over the two

00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:45,850
years that we had that fun we brought

00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:52,090
about 80 people to that conference for

00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:54,010
free so : went awesome it was great way

00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,660
people who got jobs at that conference

00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:57,670
who heard about new technologies at that

00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:59,069
conference who made friends who got

00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:01,410
mentors at that

00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:03,650
friends and it really became that

00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:06,559
on-ramp that I hoped it was going to be

00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:08,579
but here's the thing about conferences

00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:10,709
there's a lot of stuff you can get right

00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:13,109
but there are a lot of things you can

00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:15,239
get wrong and the thing about getting

00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:16,979
things wrong at a conference is there's

00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:18,930
not really much you can do you know if

00:40:16,979 --> 00:40:21,449
you find out the day that it's happening

00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:23,249
it's not like you can deploy a new-build

00:40:21,449 --> 00:40:24,930
of a conference you know you just kind

00:40:23,249 --> 00:40:26,549
of sit with it and you take notes and

00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:28,920
you get the road and you hope you do a

00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:31,140
better job next time so here are all the

00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:34,680
things that I missed here all the things

00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:35,489
that I learned closed captioning totally

00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,410
did not think about closed captioning

00:40:35,489 --> 00:40:38,459
that first conference shout out to the

00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,380
people who are doing closed captioning

00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:43,410
at this conference did not think of it

00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:45,359
didn't consider it and the only reason

00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,829
that this came up is because someone

00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:50,579
said hey did you think about closed

00:40:46,829 --> 00:40:52,069
captioning and I said nope I didn't but

00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:54,539
thank you for bringing that up

00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:56,910
childcare another thing that we didn't

00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:59,699
consider didn't think of it until was

00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:02,099
kind of too late dietary restrictions

00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:03,869
okay this one okay this was a little

00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:06,390
complicated so dietary restrictions

00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:09,839
I did ask everyone what their

00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:12,690
restrictions were okay I did tell the

00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:16,259
catering company how to you know portion

00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:19,890
the things and stuff but I forgot to

00:41:16,259 --> 00:41:21,299
label things so no one knew which one

00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:22,920
was vegan and which ones vegetarian

00:41:21,299 --> 00:41:24,209
which no one knew so people kept coming

00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,190
up to volunteers throughout lunch and

00:41:24,209 --> 00:41:27,479
going hey can I eat this is this for me

00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:30,390
and I thought I can't believe I missed

00:41:27,479 --> 00:41:32,309
food labels huge seems like a minor

00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:34,319
detail for me but she is huge for the

00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:37,380
attendees who are looking for that food

00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:39,449
and the last one that came up is

00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,279
photography and privacy shout out to the

00:41:39,449 --> 00:41:42,989
privacy policy here with the yellow

00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:45,479
lanyards that's awesome I didn't think

00:41:42,989 --> 00:41:46,469
about that first conference and this one

00:41:45,479 --> 00:41:48,660
is actually really interesting because

00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:51,390
the way that I found out about this is

00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:53,880
through a few tweets this is the first

00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:55,499
one this one says I love this idea for

00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,420
events and conferences it helps some

00:41:55,499 --> 00:41:59,069
people feel more comfortable but it

00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:01,799
would have helped me attend events at

00:41:59,069 --> 00:42:03,119
all after I escaped an abusive

00:42:01,799 --> 00:42:05,759
relationship and was worried about

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,459
stalking I wasn't able to go to any

00:42:05,759 --> 00:42:10,619
events for months thanks she coding and

00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:12,360
this sign says please drop photograph

00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:15,300
attendees with this sticker knows

00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:17,220
hot pink sticker and this is so

00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:19,830
fascinating to me because it's not a

00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:21,540
problem that I personally have it's not

00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:23,970
a problem that people I know in my

00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:26,970
community he's one that I know that they

00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:29,790
have it wasn't visible to me and the

00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:31,260
only reason I saw this tweet was because

00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:33,600
of this tweet this is someone our

00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:34,650
community Hunter Stevens who has been in

00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,080
our community for a while and she

00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:39,240
tweeted directly at us and she said code

00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:41,640
newbies maybe you all can do something

00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,380
like this for code land just a simple

00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,450
yes or no on whether a person wants a

00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:48,540
sticker at check-in would be super easy

00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:50,790
and because she called it out she raised

00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:53,340
her hand and she said hey did you think

00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:57,540
about this if not you should that's what

00:42:53,340 --> 00:43:00,810
brought it to our attention so if you

00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:03,480
look at this list that first year all

00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:05,490
the things that I missed it shows you

00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:09,000
that even though we had this awesome on

00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:10,800
ramp that ramp was shaky not all the

00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,760
lanes were paved wasn't quite big enough

00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,110
for all the people it has some issues

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:19,860
there's some work that we can do to make

00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:22,530
it stronger sturdier bigger but that's

00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:24,890
okay because we have next year code land

00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:28,230
2018 where I would fix all the things

00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:31,470
don't worry and we did we iterated we

00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:34,080
got closed captioning it was awesome we

00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:35,910
had a childcare fund which was great we

00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:38,700
got those food labels for those dietary

00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:40,920
restrictions amazing and we also got the

00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,630
stickers for the privacy the privacy

00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,770
thing and actually I'm gonna steal the

00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:46,140
lanyard idea cuz I think that's a better

00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:48,510
way of doing that so next conference

00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:51,390
next iteration will do lanyards now

00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:54,030
here's the thing all these ideas all

00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:56,750
these issues that came up they did not

00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:59,310
come from me I didn't see any of that

00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:01,260
each one of those with someone in our

00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:04,190
community going hey did you think about

00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:07,410
and me going nope

00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:10,920
all of these ideas came from other

00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:14,190
people and if they hadn't spoken up we

00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:16,350
wouldn't have had a better conference so

00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:18,960
cool in 2018 happens and at the end of

00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:21,330
the event I give my closing remarks and

00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,760
I say thank you so so much to all the

00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:25,580
people who said wonderful who gave

00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,600
wonderful feedback it was super super

00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,800
we'll hear all the things we did

00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,380
differently here all things that we fix

00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,870
last year please let me know what we can

00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:36,110
fix for the next conference what did we

00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:37,640
miss this time and a couple hours later

00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:40,880
after the conference is over I'm back in

00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:44,180
my hotel room I opened my laptop check

00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,580
my inbox and I see a list of things that

00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:49,550
I missed that year okay here are some of

00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:52,070
them one of one of the emails I said I

00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:55,660
got said did you consider doing more

00:44:52,070 --> 00:45:00,050
environmentally friendly options we have

00:44:55,660 --> 00:45:02,570
I know I'm so sorry I'm so sorry

00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:04,010
and I'm thinking you know as an attendee

00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:05,600
water bottles are super convenient you

00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:07,970
grab them you go you're on your merry

00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:10,520
way it's great did not consider the

00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:11,660
environmental impact of that until

00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:15,920
someone raised their hand and said hey

00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:17,660
did you know I did it prayer room we had

00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,980
a couple attendees who were kind of

00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:21,740
running around the venue trying to find

00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:22,970
a private space and someone noticed that

00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,770
and said hey next year you should have a

00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:27,260
prayer room didn't think about that

00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:29,480
didn't didn't see that issue myself that

00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:31,190
had to come from someone else this next

00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:34,220
one is a little interesting someone

00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:36,230
requested low carb lunch which I thought

00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:38,000
was was very it was very interesting so

00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:39,260
there was one lunch we had called the

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,730
summer picnic it was personally my

00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,350
favorite lunch but that's fine this

00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:45,230
summer ever talk about that and this

00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:47,960
summer picnic was mac and cheese and

00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:51,440
fried chicken and lots of heavy things

00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:53,480
and when you're in a conference and

00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,160
you're in a room like this and you're

00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,410
sitting for many hours and it's a little

00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:00,500
warm and you just had a lot of pasta and

00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:02,840
bread you tend to get a little sleepy

00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,340
very understandable and that's something

00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,830
that I didn't think about I just thought

00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:09,050
I liked pasta right like people like

00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:10,700
pasta that's the thing people like and

00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:11,630
it didn't occur to me that oh you

00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,040
probably want something a little bit

00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:14,840
lighter a little bit greener to keep

00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,390
your energy levels up didn't see that

00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:19,640
one this next one someone requested

00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:21,590
bigger seats she said I'm a bigger

00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:24,980
person these these were really

00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:26,680
uncomfortable could you think about that

00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,610
do something about that for the future

00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:32,390
and its really interesting because if

00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:34,400
you look at this list it's really

00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:36,980
tempting especially as the conference

00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,570
organizer you know I have frankly a ton

00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,030
of things to do putting on a conference

00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:41,640
is all

00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:43,680
I work my to do this is very very long

00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:46,800
and won't get any shorter

00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:49,470
so when I look at this it's easy to go

00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,870
can you just eat the pasta it's fine

00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:54,420
you'll be fine you can get a salad later

00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:56,340
it's not a big deal it's really easy to

00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:58,350
see these issues as little issues as

00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:01,170
issues that how many people are really

00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:04,260
gonna be affected by having pasta you

00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:05,610
know but the thing is this isn't about

00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:07,140
the pasta it's not even about the bigger

00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:10,710
seeds it's not about the water bottles

00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:18,570
this is about a list of things that I

00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:20,670
didn't see these are my blind spots now

00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:22,560
I got a ton of feedback that night and I

00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,940
got this one email from a woman who gave

00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,890
some really good constructive feedback

00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:27,300
and it was very very thorough and I

00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:28,170
responded I said thank you so much for

00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,850
all of your feedback for all your

00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:31,110
thoughts this was awesome and I said you

00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:33,330
know you need to go to all the

00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:34,440
conferences and send them all in email

00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:36,360
because you would make all the

00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:39,630
conference's so much better with your

00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:42,510
amazing suggestions and she said oh I

00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:46,200
don't do this for everyone in fact I've

00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:48,990
never done this I did it for you because

00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:53,820
I know that you'll do something about it

00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:55,620
and this reframed that inbox because

00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:58,770
that inbox wasn't a list of things that

00:47:55,620 --> 00:48:01,430
I'd gotten wrong it was full of people

00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:07,100
who believed that I was gonna fix it and

00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:09,000
that's really different but the thing is

00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:11,310
how do they know that I'm gonna do

00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,050
anything with these suggestions because

00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:15,240
a lot of what they see a lot of the work

00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:17,820
that I do is invisible if you think

00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,320
about what you actually see in a lot of

00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:21,450
the roles that I talked about what do

00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,070
you see you see a couple tweets you hear

00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:25,140
me ask some questions on a podcast and

00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:27,060
that's kind of it you don't see the

00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,650
hundreds of emails I sent to potential

00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:30,690
sponsors hoping to be able to fund this

00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:32,400
conference you don't see me lugging

00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:34,650
hundreds of conference booklets from the

00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,280
printer to my car hoping it'll fit in a

00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:38,810
suitcase

00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:41,370
you don't yeah I'm excited too sir yes

00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:44,040
you don't see any of that a lot of the

00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:46,230
work that we do as community organizers

00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:48,960
is completely invisible it's done in the

00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:51,180
dark no one gets to see that the only

00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,310
thing that you see are these little

00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:55,020
interactions these little things that

00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:57,090
happen over time

00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:59,460
there's nothing big to point to there's

00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:00,600
no one big announcement for one product

00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,430
that you could look at and say you see

00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,710
that you see that right there that is

00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:09,150
proof that she's gonna do that there's

00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:13,650
nothing there because what matters are

00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:15,060
these small consistent acts these little

00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:18,840
things that you do over time that

00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:21,780
eventually build trust this is how we

00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:23,550
really build those on-ramps you don't

00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:26,340
build one big ramp that's perfect

00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:28,620
you build one's a little bit shaky it's

00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:31,410
a little messed up slow rinky-dinky and

00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:32,610
then you pave it you add some layers I

00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:34,860
don't really know how ramps are built so

00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:36,780
just forgive this where this is going

00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:38,880
but you make it better you make it

00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:42,090
bigger you make it stronger and

00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:44,310
eventually hopefully you have one that

00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:46,800
includes more and more people helping

00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:49,770
more focus get from that one world over

00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,930
to that next it's constantly going

00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:53,340
through that loop of understanding and

00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:55,350
building and listening and iterating

00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:57,630
over and over again and that loop never

00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:59,430
ends your product people you know that

00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:01,260
loop never ends there will always be

00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:03,300
bugs to fix and features to build and

00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:07,620
the same thing goes when you're serving

00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:10,770
people it never really ends no matter

00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:12,990
how big that problem is a thing that

00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:15,870
you're fixing you have to always go

00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:18,870
through this loop so what I want you to

00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:21,390
think about is what does your loop look

00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:23,810
like what are you understanding and

00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:27,150
building and listening and iterating on

00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:30,870
what are you doing to help make our

00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:34,710
on-ramps stronger and bigger and better

00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:37,260
for more people being part of a

00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:40,050
community is amazing it's wonderful it

00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:41,700
feels so good when you finally make it

00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:43,890
over to that new world and you find your

00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:45,840
people you get that job you've wanted

00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:48,150
you understand that concept that's been

00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:50,160
so difficult for you to grasp you're

00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:51,420
able to get those opportunities you've

00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,750
been looking at you've been eyeing for

00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:56,040
so long it is wonderful and when you do

00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:57,510
it with a group of people who are

00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:01,260
supporting you and pushing you along the

00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:02,730
way it is even better but it's up to

00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,380
each one of us and if you're in this

00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:05,090
room I'm kind of assuming that you've

00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:07,430
you've made

00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:10,550
that transitionally somewhat you've

00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:12,770
crossed that ramp a little bit and I'm

00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:14,810
hoping that you remember to look back

00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:18,860
and see how you can bring other people

00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:21,110
across as well because that work never

00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:23,210
ends we're always building and fixing

00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:24,830
and improving and in fact when I was a

00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:27,920
kid I remember watching my mom run

00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:29,150
around every event every gathering and

00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,350
she'd always be so tired she's always

00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:31,460
been running around grabbing a dish

00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:33,350
grabbing a food making sure people were

00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:36,380
happy and I would look at her and I

00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:37,240
would go oh man that's terrible I don't

00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:39,710
want to do that

00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:43,490
that looks awful she's so tired all the

00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:46,760
time and she would collapse into a chair

00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:47,600
I want everyone left and she'd go I'm so

00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,460
tired

00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:56,390
she would hate me for doing that accent

00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:59,570
but it is so accurate it is I never want

00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:04,610
to do that but when it comes to building

00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:08,000
community all I've ever wanted was to be

00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:10,880
like her when it comes to making this

00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,150
new world a little less scary a little

00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:16,040
more accessible a little friendlier all

00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:19,400
I've ever wanted was to be like my

00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:23,660
mother all I want is to make you feel

00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:24,900
safe and welcome and wanted thank you so

00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:30,380
much

00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:30,380
