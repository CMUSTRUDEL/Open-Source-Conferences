Description: 
	It's easier than ever to learn to code. Everyone - from engineers to entrepreneurs - has access now more than ever to free and and cheap books, courses, websites to level up; no matter who you are or where you come from, you too, can learn to code. But learning to code and becoming a developer isn't simply about the existence of resources. 

In her talk about what it means to have access and on-ramps to truly become part of the code community, Saron explores the hidden barriers that exist even with all of these resources, and shares her vision for a web of the future built by making tech more accessible to all.
