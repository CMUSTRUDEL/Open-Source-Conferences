Description: 
	Johnny-Five was created 6 years ago and in the process kickstarted the JavaScript robotics movement and JavaScript based IoT. J5, as we call it, has been around ever since the rise of modern IoT, and the project has a lot to teach us. 

JavaScript and J5 brings a lot to the table for hardware. The asynchronous nature of JavaScript fits perfectly with real-world sensors, and the digital UI origins of JavaScript dovetail nicely with the physical UI of hardware. Most importantly, we focused the project on non-experts and we cultivated a welcoming, inclusive community. 

Knowing these lessons and more are critical going forward if we hope to create open and ethical IoT ecosystem.
