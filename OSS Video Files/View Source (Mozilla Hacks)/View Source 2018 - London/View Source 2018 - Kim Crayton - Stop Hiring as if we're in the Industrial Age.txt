Description: 
	Change is happening all around us, and yet, the tech industry continues to hire developers and build teams that are still stuck in the Industrial Age matrix. Everyone is sick and tired of being asked, "Are you technical?" Wake up! We are in the Information Age where diversity and inclusion is now part of smart business planning. Shed the outdated silo thinking that developers are only responsible for code. Success in todayâ€™s knowledge economy requires that all team members understand how every decision impacts business leaders ability to innovate, differentiate, and gain competitive advantage.
