Title: View Source 2018 - Kim Crayton - Stop Hiring as if we're in the Industrial Age
Publication date: 2018-10-31
Playlist: View Source 2018 - London
Description: 
	Change is happening all around us, and yet, the tech industry continues to hire developers and build teams that are still stuck in the Industrial Age matrix. Everyone is sick and tired of being asked, "Are you technical?" Wake up! We are in the Information Age where diversity and inclusion is now part of smart business planning. Shed the outdated silo thinking that developers are only responsible for code. Success in todayâ€™s knowledge economy requires that all team members understand how every decision impacts business leaders ability to innovate, differentiate, and gain competitive advantage.

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,039
trigger warning

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,640
my job is to make white people as

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,439
uncomfortable as possible

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,799
so that you can get to work and get this

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,520
community changed

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,200
you're in the way so this is one of the

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,720
talks i just created this morning at

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,360
nine o'clock this morning

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,080
just for you i always i'm an educator by

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,479
trey and

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,880
sarah say i have a lot of incarnations

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,960
but the biggest one is i'm an educator

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,560
so i like to start with defining terms

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,280
because what i don't like is

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,400
for we me to get 15 minutes into a talk

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,439
and people are like

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,880
ow now i get it or 15 minutes and

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,320
talking like i don't agree because i

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,280
really don't care if you don't agree

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,960
but you just keep that to yourself so

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,560
let's talk about privilege then why

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,439
people get upset about this term so

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,000
i'm just going to break it down

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,920
privilege is simply about access

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,119
access so hold raise your hand have you

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,960
seen these monkeys on

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,399
national geographic or something yeah

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,759
and so they all make them seem like

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,960
they're just so happy to be

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,439
that's a lie okay who's in the water

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,880
are it's a maternal family everybody

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,119
else is freezing their butts off on the

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,600
outside trying to get in

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,399
that is what access is people who have

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,880
access

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,560
and people who don't it's simple as that

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,160
don't be so taken so personally it's

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,000
just a word

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,680
and then we talk about underrepresented

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,640
underrepresented is about numbers just

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,480
one little white lady

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,840
poor little white lady just all by

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,440
herself then you have that

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,360
one little black guy head cut off up

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,720
there so

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,879
that's underrepresented marginalized is

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,879
about treatment of groups

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,239
so i'm going to be specific it's about

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,519
treatment of groups

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,280
it's not individuals because white

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,480
people like to say but it's not about

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,360
you as an individual

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,400
it's the systems within which we work so

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,440
although

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,080
women are underrepresented in tech cis

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,160
white women are not marginalized

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,920
so you do not get your your diversity

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,000
numbers by hiring white women

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,120
um since white women it doesn't work and

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,319
you also don't get them by

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,360
getting somebody on lgbtq

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,879
um community who's a person of color

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,120
who's on autism spectrum who has one leg

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,280
you don't get it all in one person

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,000
that's what i'm trying to say

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,879
diversity is about variety so i know

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,400
from my talk

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,720
earlier this week that you do have

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,760
crayola here okay so

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,159
there was a box of four crayons

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,760
that i can never do anything with i'm

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,120
not that creative with a black or white

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,080
or red and what i don't even know what

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,400
the other color is

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,040
i'm not that creative but if you give me

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,040
a 64 box of crayons

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,360
it may still be ugly but it's going to

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,920
be a colorful ugly picture

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,480
that is what the diversity is about it

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,360
is about

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,920
the variety what we can create together

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,879
that we cannot create by ourselves

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,720
and then inclusion this is the holy

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,280
grail for me and inclusion

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,480
is about about excuse me it's about my

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,360
experience

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,840
you as an organization you as a manager

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,400
you as a peer do not get to tell me

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,519
if i'm included or not i tell you based

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,040
on my experience

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,720
with the organization the policies

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,720
procedures and processes

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,319
if i feel included and i'm going to be

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,920
honest with you the majority of

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,680
marginalized people in our organization

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,959
do not feel included but they're too

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,360
afraid to say anything

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:18,160
you're doing a really bad job

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,759
inclusion is also not about equality

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,919
there is no way

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,360
and i see so many white male faces in

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,440
here

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,400
that i'm ever going to be equal to you

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,160
in this space

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,479
what i need you to do for that ever to

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,759
happen is to go takes

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:37,040
get narcolepsy go out for a few days

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,600
for a while let me get a head start

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,720
and when you wake up i need you crawling

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,560
at your very slowest

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,280
for us to ever be equal so there is no

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,120
such thing as marginalized being equal

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,199
what we need to do what we have not been

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,400
doing we need to prioritize the needs

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,160
of the most vulnerable and the

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,199
marginalized in our community because

00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,639
when we're safe everybody is

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,280
this is not about quotas okay i'll trade

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,560
you one

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,160
african-american for two jews that's not

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,000
how this works

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,680
it again is about my experience

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,360
we always talk about disruption in this

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,360
industry and we are really not as

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,479
disruptive as we think we are if i see

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,919
one more scooter app

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,400
you're solving white people's problems

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,479
not mine so while many of us view

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,360
disruption as an innovative product or

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,800
service

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,240
product or service first of all is not a

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,199
business it's a product of services this

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,280
is where you guys

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,639
get and get get in trouble because you

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,160
take these great ideas

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,000
that are actually products and services

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,000
and you try to scale them

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,840
with no processes policies and

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,280
procedures in place and what you have is

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,000
a big scalable

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,759
i mean big huge product or service with

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,240
nothing underneath it

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,840
which is hard to do so i am about

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,919
challenging the status quo

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,600
i am about anything that used to if

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,039
someone comes up to me and said this is

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,880
before they even finish that sentence

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,280
this is how we always did it

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,680
i'm going we're not doing it that way

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,680
anymore

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,199
so there's three pillars to building a

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,120
21st century business

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,400
we have to focus on leadership we have

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,680
to focus on management

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,199
and we have to focus on stakeholders

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,400
so we'll start with leadership and

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,440
that's where i start because i'm going

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,000
to be honest with you

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,039
i don't work with um line managers i

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,400
don't work with people

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,919
um who are work you know in the trenches

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,639
because you know what this is why you're

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,919
tired if leadership does not buy into it

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,960
by resources

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,120
um with money time and effort

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,160
and an intention that this and a demand

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,600
that this is going to happen you're

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,520
wasting your time

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,680
you're getting burnt out and what you're

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,000
doing is harming these very individuals

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,600
or even your companies because you are

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,199
doing harm

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,120
if leadership is not bought into this

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,720
this is a waste of your time but it also

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,840
tells you if you work there and these

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,720
things are important to you

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,720
it's time to leave

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,360
in the industry age the value is put on

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,759
what you could do

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,039
we're in the information information age

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,680
and the values put on what you know

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,800
this is the problem we're still treating

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,400
the world as if we're creating widgets

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,000
we're not creating widgets we're

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,919
creating we need to be creating

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,319
knowledge

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,039
and that comes from information that we

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,960
can turn

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,240
into knowledge and i'm going to just

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,800
give you an example and i'll give you

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,440
some more definitions

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,520
i have always wanted to learn how to

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,120
build businesses

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,560
first of all i'm going to say black

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,440
women in the united states are the most

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,919
degree

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,880
individuals in that country because you

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,560
white people don't

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,199
believe anything we say unless we have

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,039
letters behind our names

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,120
that's just the truth so

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,400
everybody knows in our industry we say

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,759
google it

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,520
well google all that provides is

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,560
information

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,639
it is not knowledge so i could not find

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,479
what i had a crapload of information

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,240
about what how to build a business

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,840
but nothing about the knowledge that

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,759
practical application about building

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,039
business which is two different things

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,520
so we have a definition of what

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,800
knowledge information is it's just facts

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,800
it's just the stuff that we find on

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,240
you know on the internet the stuff that

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,440
we find on stack overflow

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,680
and this is where i have an issue with

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,039
stack overflow

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,039
people are using it as if it's a

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,599
knowledge portal it is an information

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,360
portal

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,520
and it's an information portal that is

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,520
very specific to a group of people

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,360
who feel safe and participating on that

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,479
platform when you have a survey for

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,800
three years running

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,479
that says over 90 percent of your

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,959
respondents of males age

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,919
white males ages 18 to 34 i have a

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,039
problem with that

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,360
when you promote that survey as if it's

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,200
the

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,599
broader developer community because it

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,599
is not

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,320
it is not the broader developer

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,080
community what it is

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,160
is a community of people who treat other

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,720
people like crap who feel comfortable

00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,399
enough

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,240
to participate and then when you have

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,240
organizations asking people

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,920
like myself or other marginalized people

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,160
i need to see your stack overflow

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,600
score or i need to see your github score

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,279
that's a problem because i don't feel

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,040
safe enough to even get a school why are

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,959
we gamifying this this does not mean

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,519
i have knowledge it means i know

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,519
information

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,240
oh yeah y'all can clap come on i came a

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,000
long way for this

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,160
so knowledge is about turning

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,920
information um it's what you do with the

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,800
information so if someone tells me

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,200
something

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,040
how i internalize that and make it a

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,480
part of my job

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,680
is now my knowledge

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,000
right so if i i'm forever when i was in

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,080
uh

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,600
teaching somebody say okay well this

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,800
needs to go together right you need to

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,160
correlate this thing

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,519
by the time they came back i got an

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,880
assembly line because i figured out how

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,240
to make this thing go faster because i'm

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,600
all about processes

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,519
that was me somebody giving me

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,040
information and me figuring out how to

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,880
do it the best way i can

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,800
but the problem is if i can't get that

00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,920
out of my head and share that with the

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,600
organization

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,279
you have there is no organizational

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,360
learning

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:09,360
so those manuals that we used to use

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,279
in the industrial age to create these

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,360
widgets somebody you get a job somebody

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,640
hand you a manual that's your whole job

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,120
you knew you were good because

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,720
everything you needed was in that manual

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,640
so it's that information or that

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,480
knowledge that is easy to share easy to

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,519
codify

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,519
so um

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,959
i'm just gonna say okay so you have

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,200
these we talked we just

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,399
heard about deep learning and and so you

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,560
have these ai

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:39,760
algorithms the algorithm

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,760
is explicit knowledge

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,320
which can be automated so you guys will

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,000
be automated very soon if you don't

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,600
figure this out

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,760
you laugh but i'm gonna always have a

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,519
job

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,640
but tacit knowledge is how that

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,640
algorithm was created

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,440
this is what we need to be competing on

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,680
in our businesses today

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,399
this is how we grow businesses that

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,880
compete in a global economy

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,480
what's in my head if i can articulate it

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,880
to a team of people

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,959
we can as a as business leaders we can

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:17,200
now create a strategy around that

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,800
if not so this is just a a diagram of

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,680
what that is so you can see

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,000
explicit knowledge is so small compared

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:28,000
to

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:30,880
how big how vast tacit knowledge is

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,560
so what's happening is these leaders

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,040
must understand and capture this in

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,560
order

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,560
to gain competitive event because this

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,240
is what these businesses are for

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,560
you need to compete in the global market

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,560
you don't have it's boots right

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,240
boots yeah that's the weird name for a

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,839
dog on um

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,839
for pharmacy and boots

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,760
you know it is what it is but it's boots

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,200
all right

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,440
so boots is people who who visit

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,120
the the local boots usually live in that

00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,760
neighborhood or somebody passing by that

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,200
right

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,040
well we know our customers are global

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,240
we're not building boots anymore but we

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,440
keep acting like we're building boots

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,320
anymore by having all these white

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,839
developers

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,839
here building boots

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,320
how is a white developer going to build

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,320
boots for brazil

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,720
yeah how's a white developer going to

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,800
build boots for me

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,440
you don't even have flesh my flesh color

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,440
band-aids

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,279
you don't even have the hair care

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,279
products in the store that i need

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,680
so you're missing and it's untapped i

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,519
mean how many

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,040
this is i live in atlanta and there's a

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,639
really big startup community but it's so

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,570
funny because you hear

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,560
but i want to talk about silicon valley

00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,240
[Music]

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,920
but silicon valley has left so much

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,519
money on the table because you've had

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,839
black women who come to them asking for

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,279
money for about black hair care products

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,959
and they have no idea how much we

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,560
freaking spent on our hair so they're

00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,040
like oh no this doesn't make it's like

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,880
you do

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,880
do do not a woman who has a weave

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,959
do you know that they can spend 500 just

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,959
don't have just on the hair

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,360
not to get the hair done any just a bag

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,360
of hair

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,200
and you just walked away from that that

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,480
makes absolutely no sense to me

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,600
well it does because you're white and

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,120
you don't know anything about us and you

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,320
never had to learn anything about us

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,160
white people are the most segregated

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,560
people in this in this world

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,760
you've segregated your cells on purpose

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,120
it's comfortable for you

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,639
and when you see us walking down the

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,000
street you get very uncomfortable i

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,560
really need y'all to get real

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,560
uncomfortable

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,200
because i'm sick of being uncomfortable

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,000
i'm sick of stepping out of the way when

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,120
you're walking down the street with your

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,160
friends and you won't get the hell out

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,519
of my way

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,120
you're walking down the sidewalk because

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,680
you've been told that this belongs to

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,399
you

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,519
so you don't move i just want you to

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,040
remember this face because if it's

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,240
coming towards you and you're not moving

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,240
we come into contact

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,560
because i'm knocking you over that's my

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,320
goal because i deserve to take up space

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,240
so programming is a skill that's

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,199
implicit

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,680
explicit which means that as soon as we

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,680
figure

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,040
as soon as you guys figure out how to do

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,399
this you're gonna call yourselves out of

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,959
a job

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,959
what you need our program is exp your

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,880
experience is what you need

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,000
which is that tacit knowledge that's

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,920
something they can't

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,040
they can't program you can't program on

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,120
it because all that

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,880
algorithm can do is what you tell it to

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,560
do

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,320
and i'm gonna drop this in there there

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,120
is no such thing

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:41,440
as unbiased data which means there is no

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,440
such thing as an unbiased algorithm

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
period

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,959
every human is biased and since humans

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,839
are creating these

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,839
products these programs we are all

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,600
biased what you want to do is mitigate

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,959
and recognize your bias and this is what

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,120
i love about research

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,040
because there's a such thing as validity

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,639
and reliability

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,720
we don't have much of that in tech at

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,480
all we just go

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,240
because we feel like that's what the

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,399
program the thing we need to be doing

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,920
no one checks the validity i mean other

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,480
reliability is just like oh that worked

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,000
okay let's keep going

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,920
so conversations with this is love what

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,760
i love conversations about angular

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,839
versus react or whatever new thing

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,519
that's out there

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,399
it's showing how limited you are because

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,320
all you're thinking about is a

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,000
technology or tool

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,240
we need you to start thinking about how

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,160
to solve the problem

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,600
there are too many dev shops that oh i

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,560
only do this thing

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,160
so you contort this problem that your

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,560
customer or client has

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,399
to fit to solve the problem the only

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,680
technology tool you know how to do

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:51,199
that's doing a disservice

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,959
you need to solve the problem first

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,000
and then figure out the tool that best

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:58,079
fits the solving the problem

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,720
stop looking for complex simple

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,680
solutions to complex problems

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,240
so now we're going to talk about

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,759
management

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,079
we talk about building businesses for

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,360
the 21st century which includes

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,160
inclusion and diversity because if you

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,360
do these things

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,040
we don't need a dni department these

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,800
things are a part of our culture part of

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,040
our dna of our organizations

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,279
you would never change tech this is a

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,120
big one until we redefine

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,600
the how we cut what we define as

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,600
technical

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,639
yes it damages the health of our

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,199
communities

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,480
when programming is considered technical

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,279
and everything else is considered

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,040
non-technical

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,720
soft skills i don't have soft skills

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,360
i have some skills that many of you will

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,399
never have

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,680
you are a commodity and if i'm hurting

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:54,399
your feelings good

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,440
because this ticks me off because this

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,279
is where people

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,519
want to negotiate prices no you don't

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,600
negotiate my price i set my price

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,600
and because of this and i hope this

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,880
doesn't um violate the code of conduct

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,400
i'm sorry i have a price and then i have

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,679
a price on top of that

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,600
it's tax because

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,720
there's always going to be some

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,000
that i got to deal with

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,520
that you don't have to deal with where

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
you're dealing with your computer

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,839
because

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,839
human beings come with

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,559
so we need to stop talking about um

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,799
technical and non-technical skills

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,559
let's define some terms what you know is

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:37,360
a technology

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,360
you're technical in a technology

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:47,840
we're all technical we need to make sure

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:47,840
we're using terms correctly

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,280
so google's figured out a surprising

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,320
thing when they

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,120
you know looked at their employees right

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,080
here it says

00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,400
project oxygen shocked everybody by

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,720
concluding that among the eight most

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,679
um important qualities of google's top

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,160
employees

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,440
stem expertise came in dead last so why

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,039
are they still doing their

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,200
interviews the way they do i just don't

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:16,000
you did the survey you did the research

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:19,360
but you're still doing it but backwards

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,799
the top seven skills were um

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,880
and they used soft skills bless their

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,360
heart being a good coach

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,640
communicating listening well processing

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,400
insight from others

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,160
having empathy supporting one's

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,360
colleagues good critical thinking and

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,240
problem solving

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,000
and uh being able to connect the dots we

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,200
need to stop thinking in silos

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,960
your organizations are systems

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,640
just because you have a good team over

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,000
here i'm not impressed if your

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,799
organization if that does not translate

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,360
throughout your

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,360
organization

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,240
because that means you have a cancer in

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,840
the rest of your organization

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,840
which at some point as we know about

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,840
cancer will spread

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,679
these are the skills that the world

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,799
economic forum says that we need for

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,480
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:10,000
and if you don't have these you need to

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:11,039
start developing them

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,679
i'm gonna let you take you take your

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:17,600
cameras out mm-hmm go ahead

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,280
yep because this is important

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,640
because i really want you to do a selfie

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,400
uh self-analysis

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,600
some self-reflection cause many of you

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,559
if you're honest with yourself you don't

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,080
have

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,080
nary on anything on here

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,640
and we've seen people implode lionel

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,440
torville

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,320
he uh he's been doing his his this

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,400
project

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,559
like a bat out of hell for a while and

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,240
now he's realized oh wow i need to step

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,480
back because i need to take care of me

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,320
i need to figure out why i don't have

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,000
these skills

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,000
because that becomes a problem in your

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,039
project just as uh

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,880
many of you decided to um you know

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,440
become programs i decided i didn't want

00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,360
to be

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,400
after i figured that javascript thing

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,400
man that was a pain

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,120
i thought i was stupid first of all

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,760
y'all need to stop telling new people

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,799
that it's

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:14,480
learning the code is hard easy it is not

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,880
because what you do thank you because

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,919
what you end up doing as an adult

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,400
learner

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,679
is you make me internalize my failure

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,320
because you're not being honest about

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,000
this process all learning is hard

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,960
and learning to learn language is even

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
harder so just tell them that it's hard

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,760
but you can do it

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,200
so so for me

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,559
my mentor said okay we're going to put

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,360
this dog on javascript down because it's

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,559
just too many

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,799
moves and pieces just to get something

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:48,320
to work we're going to work on

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,559
learn python the hard way oh my lord

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,280
that's what an object is can y'all not

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,280
explain that easier in javascript

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,120
and i was able at that point to turn my

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,159
python code in the javascript i was

00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,679
rocking and rolling

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,960
and then i was like you know what but i

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,000
have some skills that many of these

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,000
folks don't have so that's

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,919
what i'm going to do i'm not going to do

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,280
that thing because they doing that thing

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,559
i'm going to go over here and do this

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,200
thing

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,960
so my thing my strengths is professional

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,640
development and building strategies for

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,159
building cost

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,840
for building companies because y'all

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,760
don't know what y'all doing

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,080
again you have a product or a service

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,840
and you think that's a business

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,600
so important things to remember again a

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,360
product or service is not a business

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,960
you cannot manage what you cannot

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,799
measure

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,720
and successful businesses are built on a

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,600
foundation of enabling leaders

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,360
to plan evolve and recover and think

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,320
about this recovery part

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,240
because it's happening a lot lack of

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,799
inclusion is a risk management issue

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,600
how many of you managers and leaders in

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,280
this room

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,280
actually have a risk management plan

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,159
for your products and services because

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,159
they're causing harm to other people

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,400
current hiring processes should enable

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,760
us to screen for knowledge and skills

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,880
needed for innovation

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,120
differentiation and competitive

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,760
advantage not the fact that this person

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:11,760
can code

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,919
that should be because if someone

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,760
if i'm learning about if i need to know

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,640
about i'm building a product that has

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,159
deep learning

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:23,520
and this individual where is she

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,120
yeah okay she brings comes in but her

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,400
coding skills aren't that great

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,039
you think i ain't gonna hire her and

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,960
teach her what she needs to know

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,559
we don't think that way because we

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,799
prioritize coding

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:41,840
which again is a commodity

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,840
anybody can learn it

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,840
so we're going to talk about hiring for

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,880
tacit knowledge

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,000
because this is where we're losing

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,520
people particularly people in

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,760
marginalized communities

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,400
because we don't know first of all we're

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,480
treating everybody the same

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,159
we're not understand that people don't

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,000
feel safe in your environments

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,919
it worked for you so it works for

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,760
everybody which is not true

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,720
so you need to think about what are we

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,120
why are what are we hiring for

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,720
and not just think beyond the skills

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,480
think about the competencies

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,360
what knowledge gaps that you have what

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,679
are our core values

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,080
and what areas of uh that are that we

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,440
lack diversity

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,000
then you need to look at these job

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,960
descriptions oh lord some of y'all job

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,559
descriptions are just

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,720
oh bless it um one client that i had

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,919
they hired me because i was doing a zoom

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,679
um um we were doing a call and i was

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,480
doing zoom and i immediately

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,280
screen shared her my screen and on their

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,320
website

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,120
she's in hr somebody else is it you know

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,240
developed

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,159
every instance of rely um

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,840
referring to technology was a masculine

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,600
pronoun

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,679
anybody who's ever been harassed would

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,440
not apply to that job

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,880
she was shocked she saw that and was

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,159
like you're hired right then i went back

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,400
to show somebody the next day she'd

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,880
already had them change it

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,279
they had that ninja rock star crap in

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,120
there too

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,640
please if you think that is something we

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,720
care about please take that off your

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,400
linkedin your twitter handle

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,159
all of that no one cares about you being

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,640
a rock star or a ninja

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,440
i don't care you're actually a person i

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,000
really won't be able to have a

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,720
conversation

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,720
with and you're why i have tax

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,039
so you need to really think about

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,559
inclusive language what are you trying

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,080
to um because even in

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,000
where i was in germany where they have

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,240
by law to put male and female

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,240
it was still exclusive so just putting

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,400
the ml uh on that does not make it

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,279
inclusive

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,440
then the other thing about your

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,440
recruiting process where are you going

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,840
in the u.s they always want to go to

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:53,600
stanford and harvard and maybe

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:55,120
good god these people are boring

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,720
they're only innovating because they

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,440
have privilege to innovate this is why

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,960
oh my lord there are a lot of heroes

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,600
tech heroes that i just don't have

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,240
anymore

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,440
like elon musk to see him just implode

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,600
um

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,039
because what i recognized when i really

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,080
started understanding about privilege

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,400
and white supremacy

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,240
he has had a system of apartheid at his

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,960
back pushing him forward and he's had

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,679
the privilege

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,200
and the money to do all of these things

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,440
not much i mean

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,440
yeah i think i'd be great too if i had

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:27,360
all that

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:30,080
i look at a lot of people steve job

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,279
all these i'm like yeah my hustle and

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,760
your hustle ain't getting the same

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,760
results

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,760
so we really need to think about what

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,600
we're recruiting for

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,120
and then the application process come on

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,840
people can we can treat people with

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,840
respect

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,559
can if somebody sends an application

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,559
i mean change the form letter

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:58,000
actually reach back out to him don't

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,520
ignore them

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,520
because we do talk in these back

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,880
channels and this is

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,640
one of the reasons that many of you

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,919
aren't getting us is because you have

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,559
employees there

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:12,000
who are absolute trash but because these

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,039
individuals don't feel safe enough to

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,039
tell you they tell us

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,400
so you're floating around in our

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,360
communities don't work there and you

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,640
don't even know

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,480
but where are you recruiting where's

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,440
your application process are you going

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,159
to where we are

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,760
we don't trust white people i have

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,279
there's a history in the united states

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,039
of you treating black people poorly

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,880
it is your responsibility to change that

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,159
perception in my eye

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,159
and this is where people get upset

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,960
because i distrust

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,080
whiteness by default i don't care how

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,840
you feel about that

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,360
but it's in my best interest to do that

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,360
because my life depends on it

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:54,080
interview process oh my god if you do

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,080
white boarding

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,400
sheesh that's not solving everyday

00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,520
problems that's not solving the problems

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,000
that you're hiring people to

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,200
to solve at yours can we make the

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,559
interview process

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:09,039
a way of getting knowledge out there

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,760
job offers onboarding what are you doing

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,679
for onboarding

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,240
ongoing training and development and

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,240
feedback

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,640
stop this right here basically stop

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,000
treating everybody like they're 18 to 34

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,240
year old white dudes with nothing else

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,600
on

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,039
on their mind cause i'm not going to be

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,120
doing an open source project

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,960
for you on the side that's not going to

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,320
happen i don't have kids

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,440
so but don't just because i don't have

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,840
kids don't think i i'll have nothing to

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,840
do with my time

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,919
strategies for developing these skills

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,480
seek out opportunities to do

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,559
be part of multi-disciplinary teams seek

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,159
opportunity to mentor and be mentored

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,279
also if you're a bad mentor if you don't

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,080
like people please stay away from

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,520
mentees

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,559
because a bad mentor is worse than

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,559
having no mentor at all

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,080
seek feedback on skills other than

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,200
programming

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,039
um offer the right documentation there's

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,480
a lot of empathy when you do that

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,080
um spend some time working in the

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,440
support department

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,000
i bet you get a lot of empathy with that

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,200
conduct some lunch and learns with your

00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,520
non-programming staff

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,640
participate in job shadowing and job

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,880
swapping

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,480
special um socialized and

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,960
non-programming events that don't

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,039
involve alcohol

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,640
yeah yeah i don't know what's with this

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,080
drinking thing but that's a hold over to

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,600
college and all that other myths

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,320
when we thought products and services

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:41,120
were businesses um speak at conferences

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,960
about something other than technology

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,360
and volunteer to teach programming to

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,039
these

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,679
these underrepresented and marginalized

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:50,000
groups who are your stakeholders

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,159
building a successful organization with

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,440
fewer unintended consequences requires

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,720
more than the product or service

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,880
you need to be thinking about all your

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,440
stakeholders so again in the industry it

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,159
was about

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,600
shareholder value only that's not go

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,880
that's not flying anymore

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,399
definitely not flying anymore you need

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,320
to think about your stakeholders and

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,360
they start from the top

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,760
you need to think about the people who

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,440
work for you then think about the people

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,039
who partner with you

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,960
then think about the people who buy from

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,120
you and then think about the people who

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,679
invest in you

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,799
because once if you have a team that

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,480
works with you

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,080
that feels inclusive and taken care of

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,880
and there's a safe space everything else

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,399
flows

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,679
we all got this backwards and still

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:31,919
thinking about everybody wants a ipo

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,080
every business doesn't need to be on on

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,440
the stock market

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,480
because most y'all don't have businesses

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,200
again it's a product of service

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,799
going from product to service focus to a

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,520
business model focus takes time and

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,679
tension and

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,200
strategic effort attention without

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,919
strategy is chaos

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,159
all are necessary to improve in order to

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,720
innovate differentiate and compete in an

00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,159
information age building a 21st century

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,960
business requires

00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,919
us changing the culture to reflect the

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,039
absorption

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:05,279
of an individual we're no longer

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,799
being well i'm no longer going to

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,520
assimilate i'm just letting y'all know

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,919
that

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,360
because it absolutely you bring i bring

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,080
no value to the company

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,960
if i need to be a culture fit please

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,960
stop using that word

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,000
the culture should change by my very

00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,399
being there

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,760
it makes everybody uncomfortable but so

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,080
what

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:33,279
it makes a better product or service and

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,440
a better business model

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,200
so things to remember lack of inclusion

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,120
is a risk management issue

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,039
sick business success and information

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,320
aids requires organizational leaders to

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,279
build relationships with all

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,279
stakeholders

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,840
and facilitate organizational knowledge

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,279
sharing a major barrier to success is

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,399
the lack of conversations we're having

00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,399
about um

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,600
privilege and white supremacy people the

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,080
governments of

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,679
of our global economies were built on

00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,519
white supremacy

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,360
in the united states which all of you

00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,720
have benefited from it was built on the

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,080
justification of slavery

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,600
and the until we have an honest

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,039
conversation and face that and you get

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,159
uncomfortable with that

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,159
nothing's gonna change

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:20,549
thank you

00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,549
