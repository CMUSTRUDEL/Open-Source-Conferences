Title: View Source 2018 - Henri Helvetica - A Tale of Performance & User Experience
Publication date: 2018-10-31

Description: 
	A quarter century has passed since the first browser was released. Tim Berners-Leeâ€™s pioneering spawned an industry that regaled in loading structured information onto a screen. We once referred to raw timing data provided by the browser to measure performance. But the modern experience soon demanded metrics beyond DOMContentLoaded and Load events, but more complex measurements such as first paint, meaningful paint and time to interactive among others. Planet Of The APIs peruses present-day and even experimental practices employed in measuring web apps in the on going pursuit of providing stellar and performant user experiences.

please give a huge round of applause -

00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:14,190
all right - one - UFC keep you guys hear

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,660
me yeah yeah okay I don't like to you

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,740
know jump on the sound man but I just

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,080
want to make sure you guys can hear me

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,000
nicely shoutouts to the sound man I know

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,880
I have 30 minutes even though it says

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,369
zero so I'm good with that whoever's

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,170
controlling things so the first time for

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,119
the first time ever I've had my my

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,720
slides ready and I'm actually proud of

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,579
myself

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,559
so if you guys want to download them or

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,920
take a shot or whatever you do even

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,570
though I'll be sharing my deck later but

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,760
if you want to follow along you can so

00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,780
let's get cracking my name is rocky this

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,390
is my twitter handle

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,489
it's also my Instagram handle but my

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,890
last name is not Helvetica it's just a

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,809
known plume I thought it'd be pretty

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,670
interesting but I always get this

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,960
question is it your last name I say no

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,670
people get up and leave

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:05,580
but that's serious so thank you for

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,159
staying but the funny thing is if you do

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,760
Google my life my real name you get this

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:16,610
where I'm actually a deceased person so

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,610
once again don't believe the internet

00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:23,520
but I'm glad to be back in London I'll

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,810
say this much but I'm actually hoping

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,580
that this doesn't happen tomorrow

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,450
morning when I go for breakfast because

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,310
a couple of couple trips ago I was here

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,990
with my brother and we went for

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,130
breakfast breakfast and we had this and

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,680
I was just like I don't know what to do

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,479
with this I think I ate the toast and I

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:45,930
gave out the rest I mean I left it there

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:48,570
so but yeah I'm from Toronto Toronto my

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,490
favorite city in the world probably

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,710
yours too and I'll tell you why in a

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,229
second we have an amazing Caribbean

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,899
festival called Caribana

00:01:54,229 --> 00:02:01,649
and Toronto now is well Canada actually

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:04,399
you can legally buy weed Hey now I'm not

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:10,379
sitting here as this sort of like

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:12,840
endorsement of travel but if you do want

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,760
to come up you know what to do

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,550
and what you're gonna do when you do

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,040
come up is come to my Toronto web

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,590
performance group meetup I do like to

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,060
talk about performance so if you ever

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,680
make it wrong no hit me up on Twitter

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,810
whatever and we could go hang out and

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,930
have a good time so we're here to talk

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,480
about performance certainly user

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,890
experience for sure because they sort of

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,510
do go hand in hand

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,970
so essentially I'm gonna get right down

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,610
to it welcome to planet of the API is a

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:44,760
tale of performance and user experience

00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,500
yes I like to play around it's funny I'm

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,090
not the biggest movie fan but I love

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,540
movie titles and I think they make for

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,250
great performance talks so we're going

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,110
to talk about everything around

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,269
performance around user experience and

00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,160
why it's very important by the way

00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,140
that's not the Statue of Liberty at the

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:05,160
back it's just a user holding their cell

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:09,379
phone up trying to get a signal that's

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:14,940
how bad things are so let's get cracking

00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:17,940
it's funny next year 2019 the web turns

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:20,760
30 it's actually pretty wild when you

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,730
think about it but actually earlier this

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:27,810
year something equally as important turn

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:31,220
25 and that's actually the first browser

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:34,620
the first commercially available browser

00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:38,790
mosaic who knows where this was

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:45,930
conceived where it was programmed was

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:46,739
that Park no not quite a loser Illinois

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,880
oh there we go

00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:53,760
ah mr. G UNIX okay of course you knew

00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:55,799
but yeah it was um believe it or not it

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,079
was programmed by a gentleman who was

00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,720
well and his team working part-time for

00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,500
about seven bucks an hour hmm imagine

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,930
that but it was a considerable

00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:09,269
achievement because that same person

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,680
Marc Andreessen we're not to say this

00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:12,989
software is going to change everything

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,260
now you know bit of an understatement

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:19,260
I'd say it was definitely a very

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,599
significant moment now another piece of

00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:26,940
trivia one of his partners programming

00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:30,009
mosaic Eric Pina birthday was yesterday

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:34,449
there's useless information I thought I

00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:38,440
throw that out there seriously but

00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:40,810
another significant person in the web

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,780
community are very early on went on to

00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,940
say this for me things started exploding

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,520
with the investigative of the browser

00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:51,550
mosaic because suddenly the internet was

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:54,419
accessible to the average person now I

00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:57,310
would say that's sort of like a

00:04:54,419 --> 00:05:00,130
half-truth or maybe a half falsity

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,590
however you want to call it but in 1993

00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,300
no one really knew what was going to

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,160
happen I mean it was just like an

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,650
amazing invention and they were just

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,160
regaling in the moment why because that

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:14,500
year 65 million users downloaded a

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,259
mosaic in 18 months now it made certain

00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,639
people jealous like Microsoft and we all

00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:21,970
know what happened after that but that's

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:25,389
a separate talk but fast-forward 25

00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:27,759
years to today this present moment we

00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:31,750
have for over 4 billion users online

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:34,930
right now and that's in 2018 and you

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:37,150
know no one could have predicted what

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,310
was gonna happen thereafter because

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,310
really what we know is this they're

00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:45,159
achieving or they're getting online they

00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:47,979
have access to the Internet through

00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:50,130
mobile devices and this is nothing that

00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:52,630
anyone could have predicted really and

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,240
not only is half the world online but

00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:59,199
like I said the majority of people are

00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:02,080
on mobile now another significant moment

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,669
was this November 2016 and you might be

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,889
thinking like what was I doing November

00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:08,680
2016 I might have been watching some NFL

00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:11,080
maybe no well essentially what happened

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,949
was this the mobile tablet internet

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,780
usage exceeded desktop now if you really

00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:20,169
think about that this is a moment in

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:22,270
time where it's really like it's not

00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:23,979
gonna change back ever again you know

00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,630
people are mobile they're accessing

00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:29,530
they're accessing the internet through

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:31,780
mobile and it's only growing by the day

00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:34,659
and this is like the worldwide average

00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:37,090
if you really start to dial down you're

00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:41,040
gonna see what's happening here Africa

00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:43,990
Asia India 63

00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,370
65/35 or so asia you see what's going on

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,620
you see what's going on in India right

00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:50,980
there as well now if you really deep

00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:54,280
dive and you look at the user growth

00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:56,970
since 2000 Africa ten thousand percent

00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:03,280
India ten thousand percent and again

00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:05,800
mostly through mobile devices I thought

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:10,530
this picture was amazing you know a

00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:13,660
community that shuns electricity shuns

00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:15,940
automobiles but when they're not reading

00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:20,260
and having ice cream they're facebooking

00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:22,780
friends this is the penetration of the

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:26,680
mobile devices and the internet right

00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:30,580
now now so why is this important

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:35,170
well you know we get paid through mobile

00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:38,800
we pay bills through mobile we order

00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:42,370
uber we get uber eats all through mobile

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:48,220
we flip through IG Instagram we slide

00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:52,770
into DMS through mobile so it's very

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:55,780
important that when as a developer

00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:57,490
you're essentially creating your serve

00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:02,440
like single page apps and whatnot you

00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:04,330
keep this in mind now why is this

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,950
important as well well one of the

00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:09,520
toughest parts that we have to deal with

00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:11,430
is resource loading and resource loading

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,530
we also have to deal with the network

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:18,790
now let's look at global connections

00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:22,260
across the globe 4g 3g 2g we see what

00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:26,260
the numbers are but it's not necessarily

00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:28,690
all 4G around I know we're in London you

00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:30,370
know major Metro it's all good but I'm

00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:33,460
sure on the outskirts it starts to wave

00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,590
around that 3G level and then it can go

00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,080
a little deeper not necessarily out here

00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:41,020
but you know in some developing

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,080
countries we do have predominantly 2g

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:46,150
levels now this is actually a really

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,550
interesting podcast you should listen to

00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:52,210
but this episode specifically they

00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:54,130
talked about how in major metros and

00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:56,110
just on the outside

00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,910
you know people who have such bad

00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,730
internet they're actually getting

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:03,520
together pooling resources to create

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,590
their own ISPs so just so that they can

00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,110
have decent internet that's how

00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,940
important the net is right now I'm just

00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:13,930
waving to people I saw I know

00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:18,010
pardon me and again it comes down to

00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:21,760
resource loading now earlier there was a

00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:25,720
conversation about JavaScript well let's

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,670
talk about JavaScript let's look at the

00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,880
JavaScript that's being sent down the

00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,440
wire to desktop and to mobile and you

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,720
see it's not a huge difference and

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,820
that's a big crime right there we're

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,650
sending almost the same payload down to

00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,410
a mobile device that's not really

00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:44,410
handling the JavaScript like a desktop

00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:47,260
would now what's worse about this stat

00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:49,060
here is that on a per request level

00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:52,090
there's about a 1 killed by difference

00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,980
so they might as well be the same and in

00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:56,170
fact yesterday Harry Robert said this

00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:59,770
now it might be a little bit extreme

00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:01,870
comparing JavaScript to flash you know

00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:05,380
some people might take offense to that I

00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:07,690
didn't but the fact is that he was doing

00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:10,210
some research and he was like this is

00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:13,750
not good right now now let's look at

00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:16,870
image bytes man I love talking about

00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:20,560
images and again here you can see that

00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:23,170
once again images image bytes that we're

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,440
sending to mobile or almost mirroring

00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:28,390
what we're sending to desktop and you'll

00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,460
see in the top right corner we're

00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:32,980
sending at a greater rate more bytes

00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:36,490
down to the mobile device than we are to

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:39,570
desktop how is that possible and here's

00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:42,550
the worst part on a per request level

00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:44,980
we're actually sending more image bytes

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,540
down to mobile now that's another story

00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,810
because that's image management and

00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:57,790
which is like just absolutely crazy

00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:59,560
people are messing that up so we can get

00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,510
into some other stats here I mean this

00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,100
is a classic one that people on the

00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,830
performance side kind of know they've

00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,410
probably heard before

00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,209
53% of users will leave if things aren't

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:12,870
loading in three seconds yeah we know

00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:14,640
that it gets a little worse 77 percent

00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,800
of pages load in 10 seconds or more with

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,500
the average loading in 19 seconds now

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,320
you might think like you know dude 19

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,390
you know I've heard worse that's well

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,899
let's let's figure out what 19 seconds

00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,899
feels like

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,110
thank you everybody

00:11:54,029 --> 00:12:04,839
actual facts right there that was not

00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:05,649
fake news now despite the celerity this

00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:07,779
is reality

00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:15,850
I mean pages are taking a while to load

00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:18,190
and really and truly I can get into some

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,959
more quotes like this one right here

00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:23,470
resource loading is a delicate dance

00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:25,839
that can be delightful but also

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:29,470
destructive due to device damper and

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,890
limitations I love this quote because

00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,890
it's mine

00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:44,009
facts but you know let's get serious for

00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:49,199
a minute you know engineers are really

00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:51,990
trying to improve the UX that's what

00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:54,029
that ad out there going through you know

00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:58,110
a lot of different means to try to

00:12:54,029 --> 00:13:00,389
achieve that and part of it is measuring

00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:03,470
what's going on with the app and you

00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:06,180
can't improve what you can't measure and

00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:09,360
that's where Firebug came in a while

00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:11,850
back Joe Hewitt who wrote that said he

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,730
created Firebug so he can understand and

00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:16,199
look at some of the resources and how

00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,980
they were loading and how fast they were

00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:22,319
loading because he needed to know

00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,579
now web performance API is or performing

00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:25,889
CPI is generally are the browser

00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:28,079
solution to real world measurements so

00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:30,720
we're actually going to take a look at a

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,430
bunch of some that I like just to sort

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,009
of share with you guys and so you can

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:37,800
understand what exactly some of these

00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:42,149
great engineers are doing to to help us

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:46,740
out as developers that wasn't supposed

00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:48,990
to happen so let's start alright pay

00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,790
timing API I'm a big fan of this one

00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,709
right here we're gonna look at the first

00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:55,079
paint first content for paint first

00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:57,990
meaningful paint all right so the first

00:13:55,079 --> 00:14:00,509
paint it reports the time when the

00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:02,220
browser first renders after navigation

00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:05,730
this excludes a default background paint

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:08,639
etc etc now essentially what this means

00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:11,490
is it's looking for the first time the

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,699
browser is rendering anything a spec

00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:18,380
down to the screen and it gives us an

00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:18,380
idea of how fast things are rendering

00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:24,149
now we could look at this timeline right

00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:28,620
here animation well it's actually not an

00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:31,589
animation but our first paint is

00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:36,379
probably occurring at that 2.5 second

00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:38,970
level now first content fill paid is

00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:42,269
going to report the time when the

00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:44,759
browser first renders any text image etc

00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:45,240
etc you'll be able to read this on the

00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,810
deck

00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,760
this is very important FCP this is when

00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:52,320
the user is going to be like okay

00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,760
something's going on I see some text

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,770
coming in I see an image coming in

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,250
images are very important they create

00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:03,120
engagement they keep the user engaged I

00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:05,550
just said that now the first meaningful

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,580
paint I don't want to get into the weeds

00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:10,140
it gets not so much complicated but I'd

00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,899
say FCP is the one you want to take a

00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,980
look at but this is something that you

00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,390
know if you want to get a little

00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,240
gangster you can look at this as well

00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:22,320
but for purposes we're not going to

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,940
spend too much time here and then on MDM

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,370
you can look at some great examples

00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:30,690
I mean how to sort of get some of this

00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:32,310
information but it is one that you want

00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,510
to definitely keep in mind this is an

00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,940
example at the end I want to show you

00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:38,100
how you'll be able to use the FCP and

00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:41,580
how it's going to be useful in your

00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:44,209
journey and support here we're looking

00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:48,870
at chrome we're looking at what is that

00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:52,440
opera and we're looking at Android the

00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:57,410
Android browser as well intersection

00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,410
observer this is one that I like as well

00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:02,220
essentially it enables developers to

00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:04,410
understand the visibility position of

00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,839
target Dom elements relative to the

00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:10,130
intersection route now again I'll

00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:16,850
translate that you're able to

00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:19,950
essentially insert some elements and

00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:22,560
have a good idea of when they're coming

00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:26,160
in how they're positioned and I do have

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,050
a sort of an animation to show you and I

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,839
hope that you guys can see this I'll get

00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:33,600
out the way so this example actually

00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:36,060
that I found on code parent that I like

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,240
a lot so I used it now you're going to

00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:42,750
see where and also right here you'll be

00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:46,130
able to see the images come in and it's

00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:48,990
essentially like glorified lazy loading

00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:51,000
now why I like to talk about this one

00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,890
specifically is because again I go back

00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,709
to the conversation about the image

00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:57,170
bytes being sent down the wire I think

00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:58,980
it's very important that you lazy load

00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,600
images are always going

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,579
to be one of they have you assets if not

00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,100
the heaviest asset on the page

00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:06,839
and quiet often enough you know if

00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,120
you're not lazy loading you're probably

00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:13,770
sending way too many bytes down down the

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:16,169
pipe for no reasons now here in terms of

00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:18,059
the support we have chrome we have

00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:23,549
Samsung internet shout outs

00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:26,010
we have edge we have Android and it's in

00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:29,820
development at Safari so this is good

00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:31,559
news keep that in mind I thought this

00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,290
one was interesting media media

00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:36,059
capabilities API now earlier again today

00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:39,059
we heard conversations about low powered

00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:40,890
devices so you may not always want to

00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:43,710
send everything down a pipe without

00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:47,640
checking if the device can actually

00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:51,929
handle it so here a little definition as

00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,490
well but essentially this is actually

00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:59,400
pretty interesting because you'll be

00:17:53,490 --> 00:18:02,070
able to query say a screen capability in

00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,370
terms of handling like a particular bit

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:07,650
depth you'll be able to check on whether

00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:11,340
or not it can handle a particular video

00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:13,710
a codec etc etc now again this is taken

00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,990
from MDM and you'll be able to see and

00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,880
play around with the the code block

00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:22,620
yourself as well but this is actually a

00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:25,190
very interesting API and support what we

00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:31,620
have you have chrome again we have

00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:33,240
Android and we also have opera now

00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,510
without a doubt this one of my favorites

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:39,540
network information APR about earlier

00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:41,610
today how we can't really trust the

00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:45,419
network 4g 3g 2g

00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:48,600
you know you've heard you know the term

00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:50,160
life i you know where you think you know

00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,960
everything's gangster you got four bars

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,960
but really you're not getting anything

00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,610
it enables the web applications to

00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:02,520
access information about the network

00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:05,190
connections in use by the device i think

00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,840
it's so important because again we're at

00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,730
the mercy of the network everything can

00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,760
be smooth if the networks not working

00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,750
nothing else is gonna work now what what

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,990
do we get out of that

00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:19,830
downlink in terms of bandwidth what's

00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:21,780
available at the network level effective

00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:24,690
type now here what we'll be able to

00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:27,540
check is whether or not we have 4g 3g 2g

00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:29,220
or slow 2g now as you know the browser

00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:32,370
sort of have has its own sort of

00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:35,280
definitions in terms of what that's

00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:38,850
going to mean but again you'll be able

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:42,950
to query it and say okay well I got slow

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:45,990
- gee maybe I only want to serve text I

00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:49,440
got 3G oh you know what maybe I'll serve

00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:52,950
him some images but it might be a lower

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,650
res round-trip times you'll be able to

00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:59,070
check that out as well and the save data

00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:00,690
header again very important now when the

00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:04,920
client sends that out saying like hey

00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:07,700
this user wants to is is a little data

00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:10,670
sensitive doesn't have the best plan

00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:13,550
doesn't want to download high-res images

00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:18,240
this is going to help you sort of like

00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:22,800
negotiate and potentially provide some a

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:25,590
sort of lower bandwidth resource and

00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:28,470
again you could jump in he's a quick

00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:30,690
little you know example of what you'll

00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:33,240
get out of that but the key is here

00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:36,750
again the tools are there for you to

00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:39,890
provide a better user experience by

00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:44,190
sending less resources down the pipe

00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:46,860
when the conditions don't aren't

00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:54,680
friendly or when the user is like hey

00:20:46,860 --> 00:21:00,110
save me here now support Firefox yay

00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:03,060
chrome opera and again Android browser

00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:06,180
now this one I kind of added last second

00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:08,010
simply because I came across a tweet and

00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,360
a site and I thought that was pretty

00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:15,210
cool

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:17,310
part of the serviceworker api like i

00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:20,100
always thought like who wants to go

00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:22,290
offline you know like when it was first

00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,030
introduced I was like offline like was

00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:26,179
it what is that all about who needs to

00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:29,029
go offline well I'm

00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:31,149
raise my hand so I've been here since

00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:33,529
I'm from Toronto I've been here since uh

00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:34,789
god I think I landed yesterday the day

00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:37,429
before

00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:39,740
I've been offline the whole time before

00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:41,809
I came here I downloaded you know the

00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:46,279
local map so I wouldn't get lost because

00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:51,200
these little side streets here crazy but

00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:53,379
I am offline literally and here's an

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:58,399
example I thought this was pretty wild

00:21:53,379 --> 00:22:00,740
so Jeep created an offline capable site

00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:03,440
why because their users go in the woods

00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:06,590
etc etc where there's probably you know

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,409
wacky internet wacky connectivity but

00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:12,289
this site right here fully functional

00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:15,200
offline and it tells you how to like put

00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:18,499
up a tent and you know go out and get

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,320
your own food and just you know fish and

00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:25,309
stuff like that but the fact is again

00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:27,110
that is offline capable so the cache API

00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:29,509
is going to help you do that

00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:31,720
you obviously you can install a service

00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:33,649
worker if you want but you don't have to

00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,080
little things that you want to think

00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:40,159
about again providing a decent user

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,139
experience for your user now again this

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,909
is a specific example but I don't know

00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:45,350
maybe you have like a little blog with

00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:48,919
some information you want to send down

00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:53,929
the pipe and you know I know London you

00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:54,700
guys have the tube let's go something to

00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:57,169
think about

00:22:54,700 --> 00:23:00,769
now support is actually pretty gangster

00:22:57,169 --> 00:23:02,690
here as well everyone but edge but I'm

00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:07,309
sure they're coming around around the

00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:09,230
way I'm gonna get booed for this I know

00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:11,149
this is being recorded I'm probably

00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:14,149
gonna get slandered online within a

00:23:11,149 --> 00:23:16,490
couple months when the videos go up but

00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:19,460
I'm going to talk about a deprecated API

00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:20,779
that's been removed but I thought it's

00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,179
pretty I was pretty it was pretty

00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:27,679
interesting and I put the X error so no

00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:34,820
one forgets that it's recommended to not

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:37,429
use resources eat up battery life that's

00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,280
all you need to know I could tweet out a

00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:44,080
study that came out like 23

00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:47,990
tene maybe the equate resource loading

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:51,290
CSS JavaScript images decoding that eats

00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:54,500
up the battery now you have situations

00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:56,780
where you want to check potentially not

00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,540
always but you want to check the status

00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:01,280
on the battery you know is it going to

00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:04,310
be you know if you can connect that back

00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:07,370
to the media capabilities EPR is it

00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:10,580
going to be feasible for this user to

00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:12,710
play this video little things like that

00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,240
now again I could be wasting my breath

00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,610
talking about something that's

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,710
deprecated and they're recommending for

00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:24,470
you not to use but what ends up

00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:26,330
happening you can read that is this is

00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:34,520
the support it's actually not even that

00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:38,930
bad Samsung still in their shout outs as

00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:42,050
I keep going but this is one I like as

00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:44,330
well and again I like to talk about

00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:46,700
images you want to talk about eating up

00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:49,240
memory you send the wrong image down the

00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:53,060
pipe is just gonna chomp that memory up

00:24:49,240 --> 00:25:00,680
and in fact on the Android side one of

00:24:53,060 --> 00:25:03,170
the major issues is images handling

00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:06,950
images eats up the memory you get

00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:10,700
crashes more so on Android than iOS but

00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:13,280
these are challenges now this allows the

00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:17,150
app to tailor their content to device

00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:19,040
constraints hey low-power devices this

00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:20,780
allows users to consume content suited

00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,560
to the device and ensures they have a

00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:27,140
good experience and fewer frustrations

00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:30,290
again trying to have a proper user

00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:31,310
experience is a key something that you

00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:35,080
can play with as well

00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:39,680
now the support here again fairly common

00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:43,640
chrome opera Android now a lot of these

00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:45,890
clearly are they're deeming experimental

00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,540
but quite often it's just like phase one

00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:52,720
they're probably coming down the pipe

00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:52,720
outside of the battery API

00:25:53,720 --> 00:26:00,420
so where am I here what can we all do

00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,920
with this at the end of day you know how

00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,780
these epi is just like what the hell are

00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,310
we doing

00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,080
you know what the things that we talk

00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:09,390
about in performance is you know what

00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,130
our competitors doing you know how fast

00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:13,260
are they are their load do they have a

00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:16,110
better user experience

00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:19,560
earlier this year I'm a big basketball

00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:21,800
fan and quite often enough I spend my

00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:24,270
nights just you know deaf to is open and

00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:27,030
you know basketball streaming on the

00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:30,570
other side of the screen and I wrote

00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:33,740
this piece where I compared the first

00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:36,930
content for paint between sports blogs

00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:38,790
sounds pretty like niche you know but I

00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:40,470
thought it'd be kind of interesting but

00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:42,990
I ended up getting some interesting

00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:45,480
results now these are North American

00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:48,330
sports blogs so a million apologies but

00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,440
if you don't know them at least you'll

00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,000
see the results and see where I'm

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,910
getting at now

00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,840
this was bleacher report and you can see

00:26:53,910 --> 00:27:00,570
the histogram and we'll say around the

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,970
majority people were probably getting a

00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:05,730
decent experience by two seconds 2000

00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:07,500
milliseconds but then I compared it to

00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,840
CBS Sports who was doing probably a

00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,340
little bit better okay so now we have

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,510
something that's sort of like work

00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:17,220
towards and then I went to ESPN and

00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:20,820
clearly they're developers doing some

00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:22,560
work and they have obviously a much

00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:25,260
better distribution for their users

00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:27,960
because the majority of the users are

00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:36,150
probably getting something decent by one

00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:39,810
second si.com out to lunch and we have

00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:41,550
Yahoo Sports so what does this mean at

00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:43,410
the end of the day you can use some of

00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:46,710
these metrics some of these measurements

00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:49,770
to really understand where you want to

00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:53,220
improve if you want to improve which you

00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:55,230
should and this is just the tip of the

00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,980
iceberg like I said you mean you can use

00:27:55,230 --> 00:28:03,060
some of these some of this is API is

00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:04,559
readily right now and and create for

00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:10,649
your users the best

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:12,539
experience Possible's now I didn't list

00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:14,249
them but you could also take a look at

00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:15,779
some of these hints and interventions

00:28:14,249 --> 00:28:17,999
that are coming around the pipe does

00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:21,809
anyone know you know has ever heard of

00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:23,600
like client hints yeah no well I'll post

00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:26,910
that I'll post a link on Twitter

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,460
definitely look that up you know

00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:30,870
[Music]

00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:33,299
Chrome likes to talk about these browser

00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:36,779
interventions because they want to make

00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:43,039
sure that everything is as smooth as

00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:47,070
possible for example I got two minutes a

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:48,720
lot of the sort of like experimental pis

00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:53,039
that are coming down the pipe say behind

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:55,249
flags are to get a better handle on the

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,649
network they're talking about

00:28:55,249 --> 00:29:02,159
potentially being able to cap javascript

00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:04,499
when they're in a 2g network you go back

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,289
to back to that network information API

00:29:04,499 --> 00:29:10,200
if he comes out as 2g they'll be like no

00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:12,929
JavaScript they're talking about

00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:16,889
potentially giving you warnings of when

00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:20,039
a page load comes up and it's beyond a

00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:22,200
Meg there are a lot of things that these

00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:25,019
engineers are doing to try to you know

00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:29,999
cap some of our little mistakes and save

00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:31,649
the users from a horrible experience so

00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:34,440
I hope you enjoyed that little

00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:36,960
conversation about user experience the

00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,299
api's and everything that's available to

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,710
us to use I hope you can go back and

00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:47,279
start to play around with these things

00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:54,029
go check him out an MDM now I couldn't

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:55,669
end this talk without some jokes does

00:29:54,029 --> 00:30:03,480
anyone know who this is

00:29:55,669 --> 00:30:07,100
huh all right so what if biggie was a

00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,100
data scientist

00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:17,230
you'd get big data alright

00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:20,309
so clearly you could tell that's a pin

00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:23,170
and that's my Levi's jacket by the way

00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:24,690
so I do these like corny little rap pins

00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:27,670
just for fun

00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:29,679
someone has got a set of these under

00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:32,700
their chair right now if you just want
