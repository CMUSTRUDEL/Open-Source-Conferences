Title: Engineering for privacy in Mixed Reality - by Diane Hosfelt | Mozilla Developer Roadshow EU
Publication date: 2019-10-14
Playlist: Mozilla Developer Roadshow 2019 - Europe
Description: 
	Mixed reality devices use always-on cameras and sensors to overlay virtual elements on the physical world. User privacy is an existential and essential question for this technology. This talk offers an overview of Mozillaâ€™s approach to building an immersive web browser and a social VR platform that empowers users.

Diane Hosfelt is the security lead for the Mixed Reality team at Mozilla and works closely with the Rust Project to improve security with formal methods and unsafe code guidelines.

so you might have heard of a project

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:15,360
called servo or rust I don't know if any

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,400
of you are familiar with this but now

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,029
what we're doing is we're using it as an

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,450
experimental platform for the immersive

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:26,340
web one reason that a RvR never really

00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,919
took off like we aren't living in the

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,320
oasis from ready player one right now

00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:33,989
are we it didn't take off two decades

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,050
ago kind of because like it just made

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:38,580
everybody sick right like nobody wants

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,120
to sit around throwing up all over the

00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,500
place to play a game or to hang out with

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,120
their family or be in a place of

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:50,130
business right like that's not really

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:52,110
what we all want in life and so it turns

00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,720
out that one of the big problems was

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:58,230
like as we mentioned earlier you know

00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:00,239
you can do some finagling right by only

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,790
rendering parts of a scene to make this

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,939
more tolerable but what we really needed

00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:08,520
to do was get our frame rate up we

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,039
needed more frames per second and that's

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,700
the only reason why I bring up well not

00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:13,950
the only reason

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,920
servo and rust because that's how I got

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,590
into working on mixed reality in

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,780
immersive technologies is I was on servo

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,380
and I was doing rust work and it turns

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,810
out that those are enabling us to to

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,810
build the immersive web you know full

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,090
stop because with increased performance

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,729
and increased you know the fearless

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,889
parallelism that we get we can actually

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:41,579
get a frame rate that doesn't

00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:43,979
necessarily cause cyber sickness and

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:49,560
everyone who uses it which is a huge win

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:53,340
and that's pretty much why I ended up in

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,709
this area and why I'm here now so now

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,369
that we've taken care of sorry now that

00:01:55,709 --> 00:02:01,709
we've taken care of the issue of frame

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:04,229
rates right we're done we can just have

00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:09,060
an immersive party everyone's gonna live

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:12,300
in the meta verse right woohoo yeah

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,280
break time we're done like that's my

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,599
talk we have affordable headsets we can

00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,569
all use it we can do long distance

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,530
learning we can do telehealth can do all

00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:23,700
of these cool

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:27,270
things but it's not that simple we have

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,950
a lot of new problems and so I'm here to

00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,970
give an overview of some of these new

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:34,670
problems that we've given ourselves

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:37,500
namely the privacy and security issues

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:40,680
that were that we're facing in this

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:45,239
space that are fairly unique to spatial

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,370
technologies so I know we have some

00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:51,720
devices over there how many of you have

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:54,840
ever tried out VR okay that's a fair

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,810
number and how many of you have tried

00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,410
out AR but not like Pokemon go like a

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:04,950
headset okay and how many of you have

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:06,930
played Pokemon go or Wizards unite like

00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,810
I am real into that right now

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:15,540
and does anyone here consider themselves

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:19,830
an AR or VR developer okay well maybe

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:25,190
more you know so yeah well you can use

00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:28,530
your phone to do VR in mixed reality

00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:31,079
experiences I'm going to be focusing on

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,420
head mounted displays so anything that

00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:35,970
you put on your face that occludes

00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,100
either fully or partially your

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:42,810
perception of the physical world around

00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:46,200
you and by that I mean so virtual

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,130
reality right it completely immerses you

00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,940
into this

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:53,400
this digital near this fully digital

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:56,670
world or as augmented reality just

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,440
overlays digital elements over parts of

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,109
your perception of the physical world

00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,120
and mixed reality encompasses both and

00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:05,250
anything in between it's kind of a

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,640
catch-all term because while the

00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:11,760
applications are different they share

00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:17,190
many of the same many of the same

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:19,109
aspects so mixed reality it's it's an

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:23,640
interesting domain is how I like to

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:26,610
explain it basically what we do is we

00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,070
have a bunch of sensors on for an

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:32,910
extended period of time and they are

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:34,650
collecting a bunch of data now

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,050
we are we collecting all of this data

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,900
but we're also performing real-time

00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,210
analysis of all this data and oftentimes

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,430
we're feeding it into machine learning

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:48,120
algorithms as well and then we are

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:52,440
acting upon the outputs of those

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,990
algorithms many of these sensors provide

00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:59,700
data that we can then use to make

00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:01,170
inferences or to fingerprint users for

00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:05,040
example we're currently investigating

00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:08,900
whether we can determine that two

00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:11,370
virtual users are the same person across

00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:15,540
experiences solely based on their

00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:18,300
movement and their gait more concerning

00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,960
Li we have techniques like gaze tracking

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:27,350
that can provide unexpectedly powerful

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:30,630
insights into into our psychology and

00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:32,430
these the way your gaze interacts with

00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,620
the virtual world can indicate things

00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:38,490
like whether you have autism or

00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:40,050
Alzheimer's or an anxiety disorder it

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,750
can also indicate your sexual

00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,520
orientation so these are all very

00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,650
private things that you know I know

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,360
you're looking at me skeptically and it

00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,970
does it's you know it's only been done

00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,280
in a lab environment but we all know if

00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:56,910
you can do it in a lab you're going to

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,580
be able to engineer a game say that will

00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:03,270
elicit the same responses and the

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:05,160
technology is only getting better and

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,620
then it's important to note that the

00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,450
insights that were deriving from this

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,669
data they might not necessarily be

00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:13,919
correct

00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:17,370
my favorite example because it's a very

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:23,040
very joyful and happy example it's not

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:25,980
is consider a company that discriminates

00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:29,460
against gay people right against LGBT

00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:32,760
people they do not believe that

00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,950
homosexuality is acceptable it's against

00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,350
what they believe in and now they are

00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:41,760
using virtual reality technology to

00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:44,400
perform interviews remotely well what

00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,740
happens when they train their algorithm

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,690
to weed out

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,610
unsuitable applicants they're going to

00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,250
take a training set that probably

00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:55,620
doesn't have any LGBT people in it

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,990
they're going to train an algorithm on

00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,750
that it's gonna use a neural net which

00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:04,199
we all know are super easy to read and

00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:06,690
analyze the output cells again it's not

00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,120
it's incredibly opaque even for experts

00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,460
and then we're they're going to be

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,419
making hiring decisions based on this

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:19,440
very biased training set and this very

00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:22,979
biased approach and there are a lot of

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,319
problems with this firstly you know we

00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:28,650
shouldn't be doing things like this you

00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:31,740
know . that's unethical and if you build

00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:33,150
this you are probably not a good person

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:39,599
and you're not invited to my birthday

00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:41,759
parties the company hasn't explicitly

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,610
asked about your sexual orientation so

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,550
they have kind of a pass when it comes

00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:50,880
to the legality of the situation when

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:53,190
we're talking about privacy there's

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,250
there's a lot of it's not really a

00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:58,409
settled science you know what is privacy

00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:02,370
we don't have a definition of it in

00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:04,979
Europe we do have gdpr right but even

00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,419
then everyone's definition of privacy

00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:10,139
and there are many different legal

00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:12,389
arguments about what privacy is so how

00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:15,840
can we enforce this when we have this

00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:18,440
opaque algorithm without any

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,630
accountability a bias training set and

00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,690
data output from this technology that we

00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:26,610
don't really understand it's a lot of

00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:31,199
problems all wrapped up in one neat

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:33,599
package with a bow and the problem is

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:38,700
that we can easily exacerbate the

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:41,130
existing biases that we have of course

00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,719
we also have orientation sensors you

00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,940
know to make sure that you we know we're

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,760
in space you are there are a bunch of

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,730
cameras we have RGB cameras for actually

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:55,320
getting images and IR cameras for doing

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:58,380
depth sensing let's see you might notice

00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,070
that I have my front facing cameras

00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,460
covered and I'm sure many video

00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:05,080
can't we just do that in VR not really I

00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,570
mean if you want to walk into a bunch of

00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,150
walls and have tape all over like your

00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,950
device including like the eye holes of

00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:15,210
your device because that's how they do

00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:18,610
your gaze right it's just not practical

00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:21,300
and and to be quite frank it the

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:25,750
technology doesn't work when you do this

00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:28,420
and then we also have microphones which

00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:31,690
provide badly needed usability has

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:39,820
anyone here ever tried to input text in

00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:42,880
VR and how did that go for you fair fair

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:45,760
enough it's it's a pain it really is

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,950
truly painful so a lot of platforms are

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:55,210
relying very heavily on voice search

00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:57,760
instead like I said you know privacy

00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:01,000
it's not a new problem defining it is

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:05,110
not a new problem defending it is not a

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,680
new goal it's just harder when we make

00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:10,900
it in three dimensions right and I know

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,330
I'm smiling like a maniac because I like

00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:16,270
hard problems and that's why I do this

00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:20,140
kind of work we all have different risks

00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:22,870
and threats to evaluate my solution for

00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,850
privacy and mixed reality context is not

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,130
going to be the same as yours it's not

00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:30,640
the same as my mother's and it's not the

00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:33,990
same as you know my neighbor and so how

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,070
can we create platforms and how can we

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,400
engineer applications that are

00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:41,530
respectful of individuals choices and

00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:44,110
empower them without just dumping all of

00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:50,530
the burden of a privacy risk on to our

00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:53,490
poor users shoulders so I'll talk a

00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:59,080
little bit about some applications now

00:10:53,490 --> 00:11:01,180
namely social vr so there's been an

00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,310
explosion of social vr applications

00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:07,560
which raises a bunch of really

00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:11,380
interesting problems how can we identify

00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:14,920
what is a virtual identity how do we

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:17,560
define virtually owns

00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:21,610
and how do Abbot R's affect our sense of

00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:26,530
self what do we do about abuse and

00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:28,390
harassment in these situations and if

00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:31,360
anyone wants to talk about this further

00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:35,410
I would be most pleased to allow you to

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,790
buy me a drink later on but for now what

00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm going to do is I'm going to focus on

00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:41,950
that last point the abuse and harassment

00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,500
this is an issue that every social

00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:46,930
platform needs to be concerned about if

00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:50,140
you have a social component to whatever

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:52,360
you're building and that means like just

00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:55,540
basic sharing you need to be concerned

00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,580
about abuse and harassment right like

00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,080
this is something that we are behind on

00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,700
this is something we have not addressed

00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:05,530
and this is something that's really

00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:08,050
hurting both technology and people right

00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:12,490
like we're hurting ourselves on both

00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:15,280
ends of the spectrum social vr combines

00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:17,430
the worst of both of these worlds you

00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,470
have the pseudo anonymity of the

00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:23,620
Internet and then you have the presence

00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:25,540
and embodiment of VR and what I mean by

00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:30,100
this is that harassment and in

00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:35,830
particular sexual harassment is much

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:38,740
more viscerally felt in in a social vr

00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:41,950
situation because you feel like you

00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:44,680
really are there so it's almost like you

00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:46,330
know you're you're being catcalled on

00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,010
the street but it's by someone

00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,900
completely anonymous right you have no

00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,940
recourse they could be anywhere in the

00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:56,320
world not that you have much recourse

00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:57,760
anyways but so how do we build in muting

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,320
and blocking and reporting and

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:04,630
moderation mechanisms we haven't done

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,630
much of it and we need to do better do

00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:10,420
better at Mozilla we have this lovely

00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:15,100
social vr platform it's called hubs by

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:18,720
Mozilla and we have a lot of ducks you

00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:21,370
can go hang out in Hogwarts this is hubs

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,070
here

00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:26,620
and you know how do how have we

00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:29,830
approached this whole designing

00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:32,020
a private by default social platform

00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:35,140
well first off it is private by default

00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:37,510
I create a room and then I'm like hey

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:40,360
come hang out in my room with me what I

00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:42,790
don't do is I don't just go into this

00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:46,030
wide open space that anyone can enter

00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:49,570
you need to explicitly have a link from

00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:51,880
me that I have provided to you right and

00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:55,300
sure yes that can be you know then

00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:57,700
shared too widely and then all you do is

00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:02,250
you just kill the room you just destroy

00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:04,540
it and you start over again it's great

00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:08,380
who doesn't love destroying their

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:10,240
virtual spaces I mean that's like less

00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,530
than one of building blocks right like

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,910
you just you build it and then you

00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:19,210
Godzilla it we also have as you can see

00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:21,520
our avatars aren't human so there are a

00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:25,720
lot of problems with human avatars that

00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:28,720
are pretty non obvious in my opinion for

00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,790
example I as a woman I'm not necessarily

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,120
comfortable entering a social vr space

00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:36,520
as a woman people of color often feel

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,860
the same way I was speaking to a black

00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:41,170
man who was like I only ever enter

00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:44,860
social vr spaces where I don't know

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:47,020
people as a white man because I simply

00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:50,140
don't feel safe being represented as

00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:52,810
myself so in the one hand human avatars

00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:55,750
forced you to give people the options to

00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:58,330
accurately represent themselves but we

00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:00,160
also don't really want to because we're

00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:04,420
punished for who we are in these spaces

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:08,740
with little recourse right so instead of

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:10,210
humans we have robots and who doesn't

00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,720
want to be a robot I mean to be fair I

00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:17,160
would rather be a cat or a dragon but

00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,160
robots robots are good too

00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:25,240
and we also this also handles a few

00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:29,740
other issues of in particular gender

00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:33,760
right so it turns out that we can

00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:36,910
enforce existing biases based on virtual

00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,310
avatar embodiment what I mean by this is

00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,940
that I know I'm grinning like a maniac

00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,350
again

00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,730
that's how you know that what I'm about

00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,730
to say is horrible

00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:52,510
so what happens is you know we have

00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:55,870
school-aged children in VR right now

00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:58,180
let's suppose we take a boy we put them

00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:00,670
in a girl's avatar when we have a girl

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,920
and we put her in a boy's avatar and

00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:07,030
then we have them both go take a math

00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:08,280
test the girl will do better the boy

00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:10,930
will do worse

00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:13,050
not necessarily comparatively but

00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:16,360
compared to their normal performance

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:19,180
simply because it enforces the but the

00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,910
existing societal biases that we have of

00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:25,570
boys are better at math I was embodying

00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:28,000
a boy therefore I'm better at math it's

00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:31,440
really weird isn't it you want to expect

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,440
that but it's true

00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:37,510
yeah and so we also have discord

00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,520
integration if you need to tie people to

00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:41,740
an identity there will be a blog post

00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:48,190
forthcoming on this so I'll leave it at

00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:50,560
that but the thing is VR you know mixed

00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:52,810
reality can be creepy it can be

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,500
terrifying and it can offer a lot of

00:16:52,810 --> 00:17:00,100
really bad avenues but it's also very

00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:02,590
promising technology going back to the

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:06,100
gays we can use gays as a pointer so

00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:08,380
someone who's paralyzed and can't use

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,050
you know the mouse you can't navigate

00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,670
the web easily they can use their gaze

00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:18,850
as a pointer instead and that's really

00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:22,420
powerful stuff to me so we see that

00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:24,910
mixed reality can be a tool for creating

00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,470
a more connected world and this is a

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,640
world where you can be present on the

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:32,770
other side of the world in an instant

00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:38,520
but we do need to address these problems

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:41,680
of privacy and identity and safety now

00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:46,270
before we've gone too far down the wrong

00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:49,570
path this is this is more than just one

00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:51,820
person or or one company we need to

00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:54,220
engage everyone involved in the

00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,410
development right

00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,130
we need users advocating for their

00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,110
privacy

00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:02,120
we need people involved in web standards

00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:04,370
like we mentioned before like I do a lot

00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,770
of privacy work on the immersive web

00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:10,520
standard we need regulators who actually

00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:13,340
enforce privacy guidelines and then what

00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:19,850
can developers do well there's a lot you

00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:22,610
can do first if you don't need data

00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,929
don't get it right like why would you

00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:27,230
protect data that you don't actually

00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:29,270
need the classic example of an AR

00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:32,960
application is you know I need to buy a

00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:35,840
new couch for my room so I you know I'm

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:39,020
at MySpace and I put my new IKEA couch

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,909
in the space and I'm like okay yeah

00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:43,549
that's it so know that like completely

00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:46,610
blocks my door this isn't gonna work

00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:48,230
so once I've at this point in time all

00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,760
we need are the depth information

00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:52,460
because we just need to know the shape

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,590
of the room right once I pick out the

00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,919
couch I'm like you know I really need

00:18:54,590 --> 00:19:00,200
some help with the color scheme I have a

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,720
bright yellow wall I don't I don't like

00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,200
yellow lunch but I have a bright yellow

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,690
wall

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,390
what couch goes with my bright yellow

00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:11,450
wall and at that point in time we could

00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:15,080
then progressively enhance it to allow

00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:16,909
RGB camera access right and then you

00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,700
know you can have some automated color

00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:21,320
help or something like that but you

00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,240
don't need that for the basic

00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:30,500
functionality which is to just read the

00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:32,659
room and then in addition to the lean

00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:35,500
data in the progressive enhancements

00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:38,330
right think about abuse and harassment

00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:42,409
from the start how are people going to

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:44,900
misuse this malicious users are a threat

00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:46,610
vector they always need to be a threat

00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,970
vector it's not just some like outside

00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,419
her attacker it's not the NSA it's not

00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,659
Russia

00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:55,220
it's your users because people like to

00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:58,280
do bad things when they can hide behind

00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:01,010
the Internet and so when we are starting

00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:03,409
things when we're designing them UX

00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:06,440
design that matters you know back-end

00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:08,389
design all of this matters for privacy

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,389
security and so we really need to start

00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:17,779
shaping applications with that in mind

00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:21,769
from the beginning I know that I really

00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:25,549
want this technology to succeed mixed

00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:28,309
reality experiences simply can't

00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:32,629
function without always on sensors and

00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:35,950
cameras privacy is an existential

00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:38,720
question for this technology

00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:41,720
we've found ourselves in the

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:45,639
uncomfortable position in the past of

00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:48,440
choosing between features and privacy

00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:52,840
but you know what we don't we don't need

00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:57,980
to we can have feature-rich applications

00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:59,419
that are also privacy preserving it just

00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,389
starts with responsible and respectful

00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:05,360
development right like we need to

00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:06,980
provide you like we need to not just be

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,450
like Oh give me all your data and then

00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:14,299
I'm gonna do something with it later on

00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:17,750
right think thoughtfully right part of

00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:19,639
this is how can we have privacy you know

00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,679
the 2d web I don't want to say that

00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:24,320
we're just like done with it obviously

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,210
we are not however we've made some bad

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,730
decisions that were kind of just stuck

00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:32,330
with so now that we're moving on to this

00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:37,429
new world this new 3d web right how can

00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:39,710
we take analogous functionality and do

00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:41,720
it in a privacy-preserving way so I'm

00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,879
gonna talk a little bit about everyone's

00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:47,059
favorite thing in the universe which is

00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:51,409
of course advertisements we love ads

00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:52,850
right but no really like the we have to

00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:54,350
love them because that's kind of hard

00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:58,730
the web is built right

00:21:54,350 --> 00:22:00,470
it's um the web is built off of this

00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,629
notion that it's free and open and

00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:05,450
accessible and people are paid based on

00:22:02,629 --> 00:22:07,429
ads and that's I'm not here to debate

00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:11,360
whether that's a good or a bad thing I

00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:15,860
do think that we need new incentives but

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:18,820
can we do ads in a less terrible way

00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,820
right

00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:26,589
so ads pay out based on engagement right

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:28,659
what's the definition of engagement well

00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:30,639
depends it used to be you visit a site

00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:33,759
you've engaged with the ads that are

00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:35,469
served on that site that was really easy

00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,329
to game you just create a bot that

00:22:35,469 --> 00:22:39,940
visits your site a bunch you get a bunch

00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:44,229
money it's great everyone's happy except

00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:46,089
for the advertisers so they refine it

00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:48,599
and they you know they figure out you

00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:52,149
know well what really is engagement so

00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:58,329
what is engagement when we're talking

00:22:52,149 --> 00:23:00,369
about an ad in a virtual space well you

00:22:58,329 --> 00:23:03,429
look at it right it's the same as here

00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:06,190
like I'm looking at this projector I'm

00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:08,349
engaging with the projector and because

00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,909
we have yeah that was the first thing I

00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:13,259
saw sorry I should have picked the

00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:17,799
plants I know I'll do better next time

00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:19,929
so I look at the plant and then the

00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:22,089
plant person is like okay sounds good

00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:24,219
here's some money or I look at the plant

00:23:22,089 --> 00:23:26,559
and I'm like oh alright that's a

00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:29,379
beautiful plant I would like this plant

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:32,019
in my home place right and then the ad

00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:35,559
person is even happier because it was

00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:37,899
successful and and the best part about

00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:40,509
this is we have the gaze data we can

00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:43,869
provide the gaze data and we can provide

00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:45,940
access to the gaze data ephemerally you

00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:48,429
do not need to persist that data to

00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:51,789
measure engagement and in fact instead

00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:53,619
of giving people raw gaze data that's

00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:56,739
what we'll probably do is create an

00:23:53,619 --> 00:24:02,649
engagement API so that you can access

00:23:56,739 --> 00:24:06,099
this in a less granular way because as

00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:09,729
with everything there is a downside our

00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:12,249
gaze yeah this is the best part of of

00:24:09,729 --> 00:24:16,749
everything our gaze doesn't just tell

00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:22,059
whether you have anxiety or autism it

00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:24,819
can reveal how we work through decisions

00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:27,339
you know how some people are just really

00:24:24,819 --> 00:24:31,089
good at sales we've all met someone

00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:32,320
who's just a sales genius one of the

00:24:31,089 --> 00:24:34,799
things they're better at the

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:39,630
most people is reading nonverbal cues

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:42,130
powerful nonverbal cue your gaze and so

00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:45,460
researchers have actually indicated that

00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:46,960
your gaze does communicate details about

00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,570
your decision-making process

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,919
so imagine this excellent salesperson

00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:56,039
but at scale right instead of having to

00:24:53,919 --> 00:25:01,809
be one-on-one reading your body language

00:24:56,039 --> 00:25:03,909
we can automate this and this is where I

00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:06,279
put the happy duck in because to me

00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:08,230
that's a terrifying thing the thought of

00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:12,490
being constantly manipulated just

00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:15,009
because my gaze data is provided I don't

00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:19,450
really like that idea so we shouldn't do

00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:23,200
it so what that means is that we need to

00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:25,990
start as we mean to go on right let's

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,700
not start by providing all of the data

00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:33,129
and all of the gaze data that you can

00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:36,159
then use for manipulation it's it's a

00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:39,009
dystopic future if we don't start with

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,350
privacy now with mixed reality and

00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:43,269
because it is you know we're still

00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:46,179
emerging we're not in emerging

00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:49,149
technology we are in the process of

00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:51,519
emerging we have mainstream devices we

00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:52,679
have mainstream applications but it's

00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:55,690
not something that's necessarily

00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:59,320
entrenched in our daily lives yet so we

00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:02,110
have the opportunity now I think that it

00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:05,230
is safe to say that mixed reality is

00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:08,250
here to stay it will continue to evolve

00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:10,480
rapidly over the next few years and

00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:14,559
historically we're not very good at

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:18,429
incorporating privacy and security and

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:20,710
encouraging ethical behavior users say

00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:22,720
the privacy matters to them but then

00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,669
they're happy to trade it in for you

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,940
know they don't act like that they trade

00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:30,580
it in for a few holiday deals right so

00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:33,549
instead of designing applications based

00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:36,250
around that let's design them thinking

00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:38,799
look we can do things we can make money

00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,750
in a privacy-preserving way we can we've

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:44,769
done it in the past we should go back to

00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:45,460
that because to be entirely honest mixed

00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:50,110
reality

00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:52,899
is it has incredible potential and if we

00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:55,600
mess this up now the dystopia is that

00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:58,029
will result will mean that it never

00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,640
really becomes mainstream or we just all

00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:05,860
accept a future that I know I don't

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:11,830
particularly want to live in it's it's

00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:14,980
complex space but it's fun and we can we

00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:17,730
can have both features we can have

00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:21,279
feature risk feature-rich

00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:22,870
applications that don't vacuum up data

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,330
and throw them into machine learning

00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:27,580
just to see what happens right like

00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:30,640
that's whoever thought of that as a

00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:36,429
model like we should not ever have done

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:39,190
that yeah we have an opportunity right

00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:41,320
now to do better and that's that's why

00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:44,470
I'm here because I know that we can and

00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:49,600
I hope that we do so thank you very much

00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:51,789
any questions I'm sorry I usually end up

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:56,980
on a much happier note this is my cat

00:27:51,789 --> 00:28:03,190
Batman happy note not dystopic at all

00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:06,259
[Applause]
