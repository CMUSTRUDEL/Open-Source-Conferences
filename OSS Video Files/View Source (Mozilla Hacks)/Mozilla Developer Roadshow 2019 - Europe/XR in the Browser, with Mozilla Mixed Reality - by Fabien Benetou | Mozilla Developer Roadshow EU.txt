Title: XR in the Browser, with Mozilla Mixed Reality - by Fabien Benetou | Mozilla Developer Roadshow EU
Publication date: 2019-10-14
Playlist: Mozilla Developer Roadshow 2019 - Europe
Description: 
	An introduction to the emerging fields of virtual reality and augmented reality, where use cases often feel like sci-fi concepts brought to life. In this talk, Fabien Benetou explores the primitives that are the building blocks of every VR and AR experience and the Mozilla tools you can use to push the boundaries of reality in these exciting new technologies. 

Fabien Benetou is a WebXR developer consulting for the European Parliament, the UNICEF Innovation Fund and more.

well that was great thank you so how

00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:18,520
will it we will discuss a little bit

00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,250
about what was it mixed augmented or

00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,170
something reality a bit more why I thing

00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,380
it's the medium is not perfect yet and

00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:28,269
yet where you should still pay attention

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,240
so quickly if the show journey will be

00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:33,580
actually Who am I why do I care so much

00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,190
about virtual augmented reality extended

00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,989
all this thing some good examples in my

00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:41,309
opinion example that are meaningful

00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:44,200
important who actually work really well

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,090
we'll pick one example and dissect it to

00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,090
see how it's actually working what's the

00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:51,070
magic behind it and then what's the

00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,520
difference with augmented reality and

00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:57,550
what you should do or not on the topic

00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,160
so Who am I so I work for the European

00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,270
Parliament I think nobody knows about it

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,519
but the European Parliament has an

00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:07,600
Innovation Lab where basically we try

00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:08,890
stuff two days ago I was having my

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,360
shower and then I said what's a good

00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,750
analogy for it so I think the best

00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,400
analogy is that when when you really

00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,900
boil you're travelling and then you

00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,120
switch to a channel where they're only

00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,530
trying to sell you stuff you know the CD

00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,390
they snap ad it's like they were trying

00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,670
to show you a product that can solve

00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:27,970
your life like a kind of broom it's also

00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,290
like a remote for the TV that's also I

00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,760
don't know it can do a microwave all

00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,410
this kind of stuff so in theory

00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,550
according to the presentation it's

00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:36,610
amazing and you try it

00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:39,220
it does none of those things so a lot of

00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:41,740
tech a lot of presentations are amazing

00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:44,350
but then you try the actual thing the

00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,150
actual hits a sec yeah it's it's okay

00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,160
but it's not that great so we evaluate

00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,260
those technology and if they're actually

00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,970
working well is your meaningful then we

00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:54,100
say well is it actually dangerous should

00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,080
we regulate about it so that's how we do

00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,110
we do it practically using proof of

00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,870
concept and demonstration I also work

00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,760
for UNICEF UNICEF has an Innovation Fund

00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:06,040
where the idea is we don't know

00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,410
everything and we know a lot less about

00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,929
people on the ground and their problem

00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:13,240
so if they can try to implement on their

00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:16,030
own with a proper understanding of the

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,620
limitations in term of access to the

00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,870
technology access to the end

00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,110
infrastructure then we give them the

00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:25,510
support including money to implement

00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,310
those for-profit projects so that's when

00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,230
it does work hopefully there is the

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,709
entire local ecosystem that goes forward

00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:34,569
not some other company somewhere else

00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,860
and then I contribute to material that's

00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:38,260
why I'm here today to explain you a

00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:41,470
little bit more well the contrast is

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:45,519
high what is mixed augmented reality

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:47,440
thing so quick question

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,090
so who tried virtual said that so show

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,620
of hands moment so who tried virtuality

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:57,970
okay about half who try pigmented

00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:01,379
reality bit less who developed anything

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:03,459
in virtual reality okay

00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:08,140
little bit less who developed anything

00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:10,390
in augmented reality okay more who we

00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:14,500
did not develop have a rough idea of how

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:17,230
it could be done great so there are

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,180
quite a few who still it's bad

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,489
so what I'd actually stored this whole

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,859
documented mixed reality crazy things so

00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:26,620
I have a bunch of notes on pretty much

00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:29,109
anything not everything I do but I don't

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,329
know if I last time I went climbing or

00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:32,799
to the gym or swimming but also ideas

00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:35,650
like I read a book I write notes about

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,180
the book and that gives me idea for

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,599
proof of concept for anything and

00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,150
everything

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,470
and that becomes a little bit of a mess

00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,389
like a little bit of everything

00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,730
everywhere so I started to do a lot of

00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:48,579
different ways to organize it like mind

00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,889
maps that that doesn't at least for me

00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:52,480
didn't Indian scale so I'd started to

00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:55,389
use a wiki so I have like my mini

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,599
Wikipedia kind of but the frustration

00:03:55,389 --> 00:04:00,699
becomes that everything is stuck behind

00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:03,280
the screen like this two millimeter

00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:06,129
screen is that's not how I envisioned me

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,989
having ideas it's like ideas everywhere

00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:13,720
and that became quite frustrating so I

00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:16,239
thought I put up your headset four years

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,160
ago something like this in a while I

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,109
could put my ideas everywhere because

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,780
otherwise it's actually taking my wiki

00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:24,370
printing pages like this and filling

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,620
them up my flat like this and I would

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,289
look a little bit like a crazy person

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,330
so I did not do that instead I started

00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:34,060
to do this

00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:41,430
so if we can turn the light off again I

00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:44,289
don't know it was no yes

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,419
so have my little town made of five

00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:48,400
years made out of notes I'm not super

00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:51,129
proud of it but it's mine

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:55,030
so to me it's pretty precious so that's

00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:56,590
one way I organize my mind but the or

00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,960
can also be used for something they're a

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:02,620
little bit more practical and less

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,690
intangible a couple of years ago two

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,520
years ago I think I don't know how I

00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:09,280
forgot how would that happened basically

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,110
I got a lot of pain in my neck and then

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,569
I had to do physiotherapy I don't know

00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,150
if anybody of you did physiotherapy it's

00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:18,789
pretty dull it's pretty boring but then

00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:22,300
if you don't do it just literally stuck

00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:25,840
so how to do my little exercises super

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,280
slowly super boring I had to do it and I

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,080
thought well there is something else a

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,330
little device in my desk that knows

00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,419
everywhere anytime when I'm moving my

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:37,449
head so I put a little epidural freaking

00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:39,279
Marty on a virtual screen and it moved

00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:41,680
the way I was supposed to move my head

00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,259
and then when I did not look at it like

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,990
you see the little yellow cursor on top

00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:49,630
of the virtual screen then post so I had

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,449
to literally look at the episode you

00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,699
know to make it play so again maybe it's

00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:56,949
useless for anybody else I don't think

00:05:54,699 --> 00:06:00,520
so but at least for me it was both fun

00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:02,500
and useful so that's to say that those

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,180
are personal example might not relate to

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,009
you but if you always done just for

00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,960
games of course it's for games but there

00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,370
is so much more than that of course it's

00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,949
also for corporate training so that you

00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,090
have more skill faster better but if you

00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:15,250
have anything else anything

00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,440
personalizing important to you you can

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,629
also implement that using the oil so

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,440
it's literally for what you make out of

00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:26,440
it what's you but also what others so as

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,099
I mentioned for UNICEF I helped some

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,180
startups

00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:32,710
this was ideas from Turkey you got quite

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,889
a few children in Turkey that get bitten

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:37,300
and then they don't go out anymore and

00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:38,620
if they don't go out anymore they don't

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,120
go to school if they don't go to school

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,379
anymore then it's going to be difficult

00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,720
later on

00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:47,150
so the idea is to gradually rehabilitate

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,300
them to give them a safe space that they

00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,830
still consider the threat but that when

00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,750
it's actually not overblown it's

00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,610
actually not a threat that they can go

00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:59,780
gradually to something more and more

00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:02,930
realistic scenario I also went to

00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,150
Nigeria to help image this VD they were

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,949
doing labs without labs so I guess most

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,139
of you learn chemistry in an actual

00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:10,879
physical lab that's great that's

00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:12,860
probably the best way but if you don't

00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,409
actually have a lab how can you still

00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,479
have some interaction some way to grasp

00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:19,400
the material not just to read a book not

00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,690
just something theoretical well if you

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,370
don't have a lab you can try to make a

00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,430
virtual one and then this lab can be

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:27,110
used also for physics nuclear physics

00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:31,159
whatever else that is normally

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:32,659
inaccessible how many of you actually I

00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:35,870
didn't ask that how many of you

00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:39,009
programmed in VR not programmed for VR

00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:43,009
but put the headset and your code in it

00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:47,750
zero okay I'll show you this yeah so see

00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:49,039
you like wow what is that so you ain't

00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,699
little of course it's pretty sweet

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,500
environment you can grab a 3d object

00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:56,180
like you would normally do in dr but

00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,889
then you can help you function and i

00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,409
don't know if you tried mit scratch

00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:02,659
where you have basically the geometry of

00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:05,150
the object gives a snap or not represent

00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:07,339
the syntax so if he doesn't then it

00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:09,050
doesn't if it sticks together and then

00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:10,789
everything changes around you it's like

00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,800
I learned a bit of accounting of

00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:14,990
programming doing like the fake account

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,210
for bank or things like this well now

00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:23,449
you can do it in do and then your entire

00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:25,639
world changes based on how you so it's

00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:27,589
also literally for everybody but it

00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,860
means if you have a specific community

00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:32,089
like guy who is doing it for children in

00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,669
the u.s. from an african-american

00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:36,919
background they can also learn this way

00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:39,680
based on her content based on what she

00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:41,300
believes meaningful for them so that's

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,709
another reason why you need to

00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,660
appropriate the technology so that you

00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:48,860
can make it relevant for you and those

00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:51,589
around you another is something you

00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,390
probably have heard about for is using

00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:54,590
the offer empathy using your for

00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,900
journalism it

00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,580
if you were to know who the enemy is

00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,830
would you still do what you have to do

00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:03,200
do you actually get another perspective

00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:08,540
something that makes you we consider

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:10,250
what you have to do another little

00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,170
personal sorry you knew about my neck

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,660
now you can also know that when I was a

00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,830
kid I had two eyes one that was really

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,050
going cross-eyed

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:20,830
luckily for me I played a lot of freak 3

00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:23,630
and Warcraft 2 so that fixed it kind of

00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:25,160
but you can also the beauty of your is

00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,890
that you have two screens you have one

00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,080
screen for eyes so you can measure if

00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:32,090
there is if there are misalign or not

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,440
ideally aligned and they live exactly

00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:38,060
the right content per eye and then

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,650
eventually gradually rehabilitate so

00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:43,250
again the whole point of those examples

00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:45,950
is that it's not just code for game it's

00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:48,560
not just for corporate training good to

00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:50,560
know so much more than that with VR and

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,450
finally one last example

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,910
Mozilla hubs that we'll see also little

00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,350
further the idea is there is no content

00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,750
you are the content it's a social

00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,790
experience and then instead of saying

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,050
well this is the story this is what's

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,570
happening is like let's get together

00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:07,460
let's have a proper discussion and let's

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:11,720
benefit for the 3d environment you call

00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:13,370
shape together so let's take that

00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,650
experience and take just the first

00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:17,600
second of it so I don't think you can

00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:20,750
read that from the back because even

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,980
from here it's little bit tricky so what

00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,110
it does so you're in the browser

00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,960
obviously and then you have a full 3d

00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:29,620
scene in your browser it's loading a

00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:34,910
frame so who heard about a frame before

00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:37,640
okay fourth of them so a frame is let's

00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:39,140
say you need to write the scene with

00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,480
your 3d object and you need a cube

00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,010
because that's my favorite object well

00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,810
you just write a cube so that's how

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,660
simple it is so if you've never done 3d

00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:50,540
before I think that's the fastest way

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:53,360
from being a web developer to playing

00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:55,370
discovering the RNA but the beauty of it

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,310
is it's relying on 3GS which is

00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:00,530
basically the standard to do 3d on the

00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:02,870
web and the beauty of 3GS it's it's

00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:05,750
realigning on WebGL meaning if you have

00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:08,090
a powerful GPU on your laptop pretty

00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,420
noisy one on your phone pretty powerful

00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:12,860
one

00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:15,769
you get actually proper 3d content the

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,540
real trick is that you have to ice to

00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:19,250
this I hope most of you knew but then

00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,320
those two eyes are not perfectly aligned

00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:26,089
they're a little bit shifted so it means

00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:27,740
you have one camera and it's really hard

00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:31,279
just for the first row you can see that

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,320
the image here the path doesn't go all

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,329
the doesn't go all the way but here it

00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,670
does so you have one camera that shows

00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:39,740
you what one I should see and the next

00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:42,970
one a little bit shifted that should

00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:47,000
show you what the other eye should see

00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:49,339
the little problem also is that you make

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,500
this beautiful 3d content but then some

00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:53,300
people who are a little bit critical say

00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,600
that's great but that's not

00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,339
state-of-the-art in 3d like I have the

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,290
demo of Unreal Engine it doesn't look

00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:02,300
like this looks much neater so the

00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,870
problem is and we lens you know you need

00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,910
doing

00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:07,519
normal sweetie not the order or cheating

00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,990
a lot there are showing you a 3d asset

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,550
and then if you look around it's empty

00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,500
there is nothing behind it

00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:15,050
they put texture for your hand to see

00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,760
the little curves inside your hand for

00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,620
the shape of the skin but that's also

00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,839
fake you just like how the light is

00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,339
projected to it but in VR you cannot

00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:23,810
check like this you cannot cheat because

00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:24,800
the person is going to move all around

00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,560
they're going to stick their nose

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,750
literally against your objects so a lot

00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,430
of the techniques let's call it

00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,680
technique instead of cheating they don't

00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:36,050
apply your anymore so it will take a

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,730
little bit of time to go from state of

00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,680
the Audion 3d we think they're all a

00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:42,380
little bit less cartoonish but it's

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:49,390
still it's coming so now who heard about

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:52,430
pose what suppose one person great so

00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:56,769
that's it I'll just let you read the

00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:58,279
specifications I'm not going to do that

00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:00,709
to read it

00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:02,930
it is important but the specification

00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:04,370
can be a little bit I mean if you if you

00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,620
like some sleep and you want to do is

00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,480
off you can just but it's important but

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,860
the first step is to actually ask your

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,410
browser to give you a pose

00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:15,589
so the pose you will ask to Firefox or

00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:18,130
Firefox ability straight from by default

00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:21,430
you have everything you need for VR and

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:23,230
then because of course in work

00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:35,530
you the browser is going to ask your

00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:39,730
headset like this one little bit of

00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:43,410
suspense but it's going to be is the

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,410
backup link doesn't work I can't do much

00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:54,630
so thanks to Stephanie here in the back

00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:58,090
little example Oh a little example

00:13:54,630 --> 00:14:00,430
that's ok so you have you your headset

00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,950
with its two little cameras no depth

00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:04,840
sensor just traditional cameras and then

00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:07,420
it's looking for what's called feature

00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,820
points which are those little yellow

00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:12,640
dots there so for example here if it's

00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,560
looking here it's perfectly white or

00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,690
grayish there is nothing interesting if

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,610
it's look here here here is exactly the

00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,230
same but if you were here on the edge

00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:22,450
for example you have some white some

00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,430
black some contrast on differences so it

00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,860
can identify oh there is a an

00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:29,040
interesting spot here see if I have

00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:33,840
those let's say three interesting spots

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:36,880
they are here here we do a little quiz

00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,340
so the headsets see those three little

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,440
yellow dots and now he sees them like

00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:48,330
this so where did it move it was here

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:53,590
before like this so if I do like this

00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:55,630
I'm back so you can do this because you

00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:58,390
assume that the world is rigid like not

00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:00,730
everything is a piece of clothes and the

00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,710
camera can infer its position from

00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:05,290
enough feature points that's that's

00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:08,920
literally the magic behind Vone or if

00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:11,230
you have enough high quality cameras and

00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:15,580
a few points then you can detect where

00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:18,790
you think you should and then you pass

00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:20,560
it all the way back so the headset and

00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:24,010
its sensors pass it to the browser the

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,080
browser the browser passes it to a frame

00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:29,500
or 3GS or another framework if you want

00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:31,750
and then not the trick with the way that

00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,840
it makes it look so natural is you have

00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,620
your position in space so the pose with

00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,040
it

00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,540
rotation and actually where it is

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,740
because as we saw before with the three

00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,080
points we know if I'm backward or

00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,250
forward and then you just attach it to

00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,200
your camera so you have your three

00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:49,360
scenes and instead of saying hey my

00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,740
camera is fixed then my camera is the

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,260
position of the headset and it's

00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,360
rotation that's basically all there is

00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,340
to it

00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:01,180
the little demo I'm going to skip it for

00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:04,450
now but I'll be in the back so you'll be

00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:06,820
able to try it yourself even better so

00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,200
it's the same thing is honestly just

00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,210
watching your content which is already

00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,460
amazing it's mind-blowing you feel some

00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:14,710
well blah blah blah but it's not so fun

00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:16,180
if you cannot play with it so it starts

00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:18,700
to be fun when you can actually grab

00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:21,910
object through object joint space and

00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,410
all this especially drawing because it's

00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,760
so natural like I don't know if you try

00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:28,120
to use blender or Maya

00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,890
I mean blender is amazing but it's a

00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,840
little bit stiff it's difficult like

00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,670
when I say the cube is my favorite

00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,350
geometric object it's maybe because I

00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,670
don't hear you have the skill to be

00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,520
something more complicated than this

00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:41,620
thing is if you do it in VR you just I

00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,720
mean I can move my hand in any way I

00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,610
want it's just how smart your body is

00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,750
you can move it like this and just paint

00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:53,250
post-cold in 3d so the trick is the same

00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:55,630
way you had a pose before I'll show you

00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:58,030
but their headset can you see the white

00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:00,340
dot on the controller so it's all black

00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:02,050
on white so the same way you had the

00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,060
yellow dots identified by the camera

00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:06,130
then you identify those black and yellow

00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:09,100
dot and you see how close or how far it

00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:11,140
is and how what's the rotation so you

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,730
get the pose also for the controller so

00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:15,190
you know where it is relative to the

00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:17,230
headset and then when you press the

00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:20,170
button didn't you just use the gamepad

00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:22,420
API so you just have all the information

00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:25,480
in terms of pressing button axes

00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,860
pressure anything like this and that

00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,380
gives you in addition to let's say

00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:31,270
painting some really natural interaction

00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,250
that's one of the beauty of Yoric is

00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:35,680
honestly being somewhere else is amazing

00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,930
but having your hands rather than just

00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,450
like typing on a keyboard on a gamepad

00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:42,130
but rather moving around 3d it's a

00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,890
completely different experience so for

00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:46,960
example the most basic yet interesting

00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,070
one is rubbing your duck to make it

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,200
quite

00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,910
that's just random example so you have

00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,580
your controller your position in space

00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:56,050
its rotation and then you have the

00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,610
object let's say a duck and then you

00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,970
just measure the distance between the

00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,730
two

00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:04,090
luckily for you if you forgot like me

00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:06,700
bit of your basic math from a couple of

00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:08,680
years ago 3G has got you back you get

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:12,040
some utility function that just measured

00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:14,200
the distance between the two vectors so

00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:17,140
that gives you basically your little

00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:21,840
duck o cube you will controller you get

00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,840
its position yield position of the cubes

00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,650
you compare the two let's say your

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,720
distance is 1 centimeter 1 meter

00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:30,390
whatever you want it to be and then you

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,490
make it quack

00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:36,520
so the problem is hopefully now you get

00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:38,500
a rough idea on how your works and how

00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,470
you could do with your experience so the

00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,880
problem is that's the easy part

00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:45,460
the question after that comes how to

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,220
make it right how you can do it

00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,990
respecting privacy respecting whatever

00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,120
you think is the right way to do it and

00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:54,730
then having discussions about it so

00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,830
luckily for me because it's too hard

00:18:54,730 --> 00:19:04,480
Diane is going to discuss about all this

00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:06,670
after thanks for that what is this the

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,340
plug from the matrix so my personal

00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:11,020
opinion on this is well first we're

00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,640
nowhere near I mean put the headset on

00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,010
after if you haven't tried it I really

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,720
recommend most of you think if you

00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:18,370
haven't tried it I think I and I know

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,320
what VR is like you put their headset

00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,030
you somewhere else it's such a guttural

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,100
experience such a personal intimate

00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:26,260
experience like I want to stay polite

00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:29,230
but you have no F idea it's really

00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:31,150
you're somewhere else but you know

00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:33,400
you're somewhere else kill like this is

00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,230
nowhere near the matrix because like

00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,970
there is no heat let's say will you

00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,760
touch an object there is no texture to

00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,830
the object so to go from being somewhere

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,680
else to I'd cannot distinguish any more

00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:46,810
reality when I'm conscious and I try to

00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,700
pay attention it's completely different

00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:51,370
but the thing is in my being doesn't

00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:54,150
matter that's not well the real issue is

00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:57,400
the real issue is it's a social and

00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:59,560
individual psychological problem or

00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,940
challenge rather let's say is if you

00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,610
know or if you push

00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,840
think you have an addictive behavior and

00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,060
you know it confortable and you're

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,040
trying to escape your daily life well

00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,900
maybe you shouldn't drive your or if you

00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,400
want to maybe you should do it with the

00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,320
supervision of someone else who can

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,600
judge if you actually having a proper

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,730
behavior or not so it's a personal

00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,180
individual problem but also a social one

00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:24,160
so if we believe it is risky then us as

00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:29,560
a society should pay attention on how

00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:31,840
it's being used so something a bit

00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,820
easier just a technical question so what

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:48,090
the difference between virtual reality

00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:48,090
and augmented reality yeah yeah

00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:53,290
exactly

00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,060
so I'll just repeat a bit for people in

00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:57,100
the back that you don't match ability

00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:59,440
you add content on top of what you see

00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,810
in virtuality everything is the content

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,570
everything that is outside that the

00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:06,490
headset is hidden so that's we are what

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:11,410
I don't see you anymore and then if I

00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:13,690
have my tablet my phone my magiclip

00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:16,540
hololens and I can actually see that

00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:18,190
source more but what makes augmented

00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:21,700
reality interesting is actually when you

00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:24,580
get more than just adding content rather

00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:26,680
when the computer and its camera and

00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,840
sensors can say well actually that's the

00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,760
floor because then you can add object on

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:34,030
top of it which will share whatever you

00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,070
want to be or well that's a chair

00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,930
because then I can add content on top of

00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,220
it and I can say well maybe I should

00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,240
have a matching table but the more

00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,280
information you have about the

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,110
environment the more meaningful the more

00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,320
interesting the experience is so it's a

00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:49,360
lot more than just adding content it's

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:53,920
having a rough understanding of reality

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:56,830
around you in order to add content so I

00:21:53,920 --> 00:22:00,040
still have a bit of time yeah it just to

00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:03,280
show how similar it is is you have the

00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:05,170
camera and you pose that's we are and

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,180
it's your camera and you pose that we

00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:09,400
are so it's the same except that one is

00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,380
opaque the other it's translucent with

00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,210
after that all the computer vision to

00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,230
say well that's the ground or that's a

00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:19,240
flat plane

00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:23,470
or that's it here so let's see if we can

00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:25,210
do a little lightning I'll try to

00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,680
briefly show you how it works so I hope

00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:31,690
some of you are crossing your fingers

00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:38,830
because really that's the moment that it

00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:40,720
might work so that's also the moment

00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:46,000
when I hope no city notification shows

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:47,560
up of course that's the moment also

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,020
where it asked for permissions and I

00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,670
read everything extremely carefully

00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,930
before but that's a demo and I have

00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,580
colleagues that are kind of telling me

00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:57,490
you don't have time for this so I'll

00:22:54,580 --> 00:23:01,890
just press confirm that you will read it

00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:04,360
and then I can have already on the floor

00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:06,700
that video object that doesn't exist

00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,110
before the little vertical so show you a

00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,600
couple more things you can see on top

00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:13,300
that if you have a URL so it is a

00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:17,260
browser the module acts our viewer for

00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:18,880
us can have feet also there and the

00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:21,130
interesting point also is what I showed

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,930
you before so you can see all those

00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,910
little feature points all the little

00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:26,530
yellow points where the camera is able

00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:29,200
to say well this is interesting enough

00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:31,990
and I can compare frame by frame that I

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,720
can know where I am in space so there

00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:36,550
are a lot more example on the module

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,450
likes of your website and invite you to

00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:42,460
try them it's on the web meaning can

00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:44,470
suit display source and see actually how

00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,450
it's done and then once you know that

00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:50,080
you can make your own page tweak it and

00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:56,710
that's it you got started already so

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:59,440
that worked so somebody already before

00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:01,420
asked me what's the difference between

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,760
virtuality augmented reality mixed

00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:07,390
reality so it is important to use terms

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,740
correctly but in my opinion what matters

00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:10,330
is if you do something interesting with

00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,820
it of course in order to have a proper

00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:14,770
conversation you need to new to know

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:17,290
those terms but if you just know those

00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:19,030
terms to use them because it sounds cold

00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,080
pointless if you do something useful

00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:22,450
with it then I think it's a lot more

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,040
interesting for something non useful I

00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:26,350
had did this little prototype with a

00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,000
friend from Samsung research where we

00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:31,150
control tux

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,340
by a robotic arm so we have a copy or

00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:36,610
digital twin of the robotic arm in VR

00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:39,040
and then we can control in VR the robot

00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:41,260
behavior and then real-life impact back

00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,200
from the virtual world so you can yeah

00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:45,970
well virtual lady augmented reality

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,500
externality all that as long as you do

00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:49,110
something useful meaningful I think

00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:54,130
that's what matters

00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:57,460
so all that said why you should not try

00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:59,440
where Big Sur so candidly or honestly I

00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,380
mean honest if you need to deploy to all

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,720
platforms tomorrow no that's I'm not

00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:07,330
going I'm good luck but it's not going

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,430
to work literally tomorrow the support

00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:12,370
is growing and everybody is on board in

00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:15,640
terms of w3c specifications for Mozilla

00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:18,460
obviously to Apple to Google to Samsung

00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:22,540
to magic leave two more initial

00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:24,610
professional hardware manufacturers but

00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:26,140
it's take me a bit of time because we

00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:28,660
believe it going to change everything so

00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,850
it has to be done right if you don't

00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,310
care about 3d I have friends who are

00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:35,470
just into fonts and that's fine you just

00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:38,110
you have so much to do in 3d you need to

00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:40,480
think differently and have the notion of

00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:43,660
space and when you put objects that if

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,820
you are not excited by 3d probably not

00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:48,430
or crazy interaction new interaction how

00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,590
to touch object grab objects move them

00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:52,360
throw them all this is being figured out

00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:55,060
now so if you don't want to play with

00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:57,340
those crazy interactions maybe wait a

00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:59,770
little bit more or if you need a stable

00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:01,600
tool chain like let's say you work at

00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:04,000
the European Parliament or if you work

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,750
for a nuclear power plant maybe wait a

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,420
little bit more still that being said

00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:12,040
why should still invest time in learning

00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:16,180
where they start to more morning well I

00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:17,170
mean it works simple enough you don't

00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,880
have to believe me

00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:22,180
I know there are some skeptics that's

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:25,270
fair so again come at during the break

00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:26,770
and even after and just try it you'll

00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,620
see you just put the headset on your

00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:31,090
somewhere else simple as that

00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:32,740
it's a new frontier so I mean you have

00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:34,600
to little be to be a little bit sadder

00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,520
masochistic because you need to learn

00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,220
fix in flux but I think it's really

00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:41,760
worth it it's so exciting like the the

00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:45,430
bags under your eyes come from this

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:47,260
also and I think as importantly at least

00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:49,630
is if you don't shape a new medium who

00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:51,820
will you cannot complain that it's being

00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:53,440
abused if nothing's interesting what not

00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,060
take part of it

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,340
propose something better to something

00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:59,620
nicer more interesting that's in my

00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:01,900
opinion evil is a new medium bless you

00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:04,180
it has to be shaped by whatever you can

00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:07,420
do and what you want to do with it the

00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:09,340
long sentence number four is basically

00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:12,010
yeah I don't know if everybody's going

00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:15,100
to use the or or a are in one year five

00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:17,590
year ten years I actually don't know but

00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:19,180
I think if some of us do and more

00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:21,100
mothers do we need to understand how

00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:23,350
it's working to understand what are the

00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:26,590
challenges in term of privacy

00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:28,840
ethically in terms of how it's going to

00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:31,330
change our lives and even if you don't

00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:35,110
use PR that somebody brings a VR headset

00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:37,630
in your home where our headset who were

00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:38,890
world all those information going you

00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,810
need to understand a bit how it's done

00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:43,290
to say well actually I don't want this

00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:45,550
well I want it but I want it done right

00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:47,260
and yeah if you have a cognitive science

00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:49,390
degree and you never know what to do

00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:53,170
with it definitely that's the field for

00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:55,920
it so practically speaking first step

00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:59,830
don't die the most expensive headset

00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:02,800
with a super fancy laptop just come try

00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:04,840
this even try it see where it is see how

00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:08,920
you feel about it eventually you say

00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:10,420
well not yet not familiar obviously as I

00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,010
show you you can install the multi like

00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,550
so if you on your phone and so to play

00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:16,810
around

00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:18,250
so to remix examples just Firefox which

00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:21,580
probably have already on your desktop

00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:23,860
just plug the headset and it will work

00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:25,270
okay might take five minutes but the

00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:28,270
setup is really straightforward and you

00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:32,040
can just use a touch of example on the

00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:34,840
web and to get something exciting going

00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:38,320
you can also just come online and have a

00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:40,990
chat in VR we have a bunch of events on

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,530
Mozilla hubs so you can come without the

00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:46,210
are but I mean it's more fun and more

00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:47,920
you feel there with the headset and you

00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:50,140
feel so focused in the conversation

00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,850
you're not checking your phones or get

00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:55,030
another notification you're in the

00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,360
moment with others and as I mentioned

00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,120
couple

00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,070
time remix examples that in my opinion

00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,080
that's the best way like if you were to

00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:04,330
learn you have a delicious dish and

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,549
you're going to cook it well do it once

00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:09,580
and eventually well if you don't like it

00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:11,500
well that's okay but that's fighting

00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:13,809
with the medium in my opinion that's the

00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:17,140
nicest way to understand how it's

00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:18,760
working and it's a lot of fun so if you

00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,520
want to dig even deeper well you can

00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:24,100
contribute back there are a lot of ways

00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:26,830
from coding to documentation to just

00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:28,210
chatting around and obviously because

00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,600
it's in flux because it's changing all

00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,340
the time

00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,160
it means the documentation always need

00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:35,500
helps so if you enjoy ndn contribute

00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,880
back if you see a bug in Firefox quality

00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,130
because it's still a new browser

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,950
well first mention it and if you have an

00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:44,890
idea because it's open source well you

00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:46,480
can actually try to fix it yourself if

00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:48,490
you want to understand those little

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,210
yellow dots so why dots how it's

00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:52,510
actually working

00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:54,400
well computer vision I think that's one

00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:58,179
of the best way to understand how all

00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,500
those new technologies are currently and

00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:01,090
there are a lot of really fun if you

00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,490
into a design pattern for user

00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:05,830
experience a lot of ways to interact so

00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:07,630
there are already repository catalogs on

00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:10,840
those interactions you can explore those

00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:14,590
and at least as important here as the

00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:17,799
previous ones make your own stuff that's

00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:23,730
it I'll just show you a little 360 of

00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:23,730
VNL before this it was just on the way

00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:33,220
took 30 seconds also you have to pack

00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:38,230
that's part of the show that's part of

00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:41,530
the sword skill that's it so yeah try

00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:44,140
stuff come after see how it's done right

00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:47,049
also with the neck so from Diane and

00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,710
then yes thank you so much slides on the

00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:57,669
hero code thank you

00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:57,669
