all right we're gonna welcome up our

00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,020
panelists first one is non ideality Nia

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,639
you may have heard of her she's the

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,590
founder and CEO of emblematic group

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,330
she's widely regarded as one of the most

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,889
influential pioneers in virtual and

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,870
augmented reality we also have joining

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:17,670
us today Rick Adams Rick Adams is a

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:23,609
mixed reality producer in senior

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:26,250
reporter at Spectrum News one would be a

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,560
lot easier and a lot more accessible for

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,630
anyone to make story with and that's

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,000
where we began to reach and reaches all

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,989
built in what we are through the browser

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,670
this technology that Mozilla and

00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:40,860
emblematic has partnered with it's just

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,500
an incredible technology for creating

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,360
virtual reality Nonis is opening up this

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,250
whole new realm for people to be able to

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,200
do it simplistically and easily and

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,930
that's the key to proper storytelling

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,239
even somebody who's had zero technical

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,739
experience I can put you in front of

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,000
this computer right now and within 10

00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,219
minutes you're going to be able to make

00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,850
your own pieces and I think that's the

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,570
key thing

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,239
[Music]

00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:06,100
we could use unity or unreal but that's

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,860
very difficult to do in a merely

00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,780
intimidating I work with students the

00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,960
vast majority are storytellers whether

00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,760
it's journalism or PR and comm they're

00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,040
coming from different backgrounds and

00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,350
I'm always looking for tools and

00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,660
platforms that will enable them to tell

00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,920
stories for free or for cheap and as

00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,750
easy as possible

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,720
and reach looks like it has the

00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,790
potential to do just that what's amazing

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,100
about it is you use a web browser like

00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,300
Firefox you go straight into that click

00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,430
on the buttons you don't even need a

00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,200
headset you can actually navigate the

00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:41,229
scene you know what feels like a

00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,150
three-dimensional virtual experience and

00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:45,009
also what's incredible is you can click

00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,690
on a button below the picture and then

00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:49,000
if you've got a virtual reality headset

00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,190
you can just stick it on and immediately

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,160
experience it that is not just the

00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:55,390
purview of a highly educated engineer

00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,869
that I mean putting engineers out of

00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,850
business

00:01:55,869 --> 00:02:00,090
but I do want to bring everybody to the

00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,090
