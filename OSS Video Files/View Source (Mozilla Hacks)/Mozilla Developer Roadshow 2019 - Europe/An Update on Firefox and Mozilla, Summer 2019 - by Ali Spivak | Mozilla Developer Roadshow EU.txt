	00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:21,619
there we go hi thank everyone for for

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,180
coming here and also to all of our hosts

00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:28,529
it's really exciting for us to be doing

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:31,860
our roadshow I assume most of you know

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,210
who mozilla is so I'm going to take a

00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,969
little bit of Missoula and a little bit

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,160
about Firefox one thing that a lot of

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:41,700
people don't know about Missoula is that

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,130
we are a non-profit tech company so we

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,970
don't have shareholders we are a mission

00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:50,040
based company so when we say actually we

00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,200
put people before profit we we mean it

00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,920
because we're not in business to make a

00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,750
profit and we really do strive to keep

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,579
the internet open and accessible for

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,770
everyone and to really think about

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,470
what's best for people not what's best

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,549
for shareholders or what's best for you

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,690
know controlling interests in our

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:13,380
company so i'm alice pieszecki I'm based

00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:17,460
in San Francisco and I run developer

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,380
relations for Mozilla so the developer

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,520
Roadshow it's all my fault so if you

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,010
have a terrible time you can come yell

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,630
at me

00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,820
you can reach me usually on Twitter my

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:31,049
DMS are open if you have any questions

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:35,479
I'll be here after so I think everybody

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:38,310
you're familiar with Firefox yeah

00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:43,619
already be familiar with any of the

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:46,140
other forms of Firefox so we have

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,000
developer edition which is specifically

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,909
for folks who want to use our dev tools

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,450
and do testing we have beta which is the

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,340
pre-release stable version so if you're

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,619
trying to see what's coming up in the

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,420
next release but you don't want to take

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,310
a lot see a lot of risky technology beta

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,619
is really good and then we have nightly

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,259
which lives up to its name it is updated

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,689
every night that's where you can see the

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,039
latest and greatest in all sorts of new

00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:12,689
things that we're going to be putting in

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,909
the browser some of which may take a

00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:17,159
really long time to actually make it to

00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:19,730
beta and all the way through up to our

00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:22,020
release version

00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:25,260
we also have something really new which

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:29,520
we're calling Firefox preview this is a

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:32,070
brand new browser Firefox for Android it

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,590
is built from the ground up and it's

00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,990
basically taking the concept of Firefox

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,310
Focus which was a very stripped-down

00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,230
fast

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,600
Android browser that focused on privacy

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:45,540
and security and growing it into a fully

00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,130
featured browser if you're familiar at

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,190
all with browsers and I won't bore

00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:52,080
everyone with all the gory details but

00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:54,840
Firefox runs on a browser engine which

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,600
is called gecko we have a new version of

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,760
gecko that's built very specific from

00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,190
mobile called gecko view and this is

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,100
really the first iteration of us using

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,700
gecko view and a product it's currently

00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,390
a bait yeah

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,680
currently available justice of beta and

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,300
you can also see the project on github

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,310
if you're interested in sort of seeing

00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,620
what's going on there it's a lot faster

00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:21,060
but it also again really focuses so much

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:23,040
on the privacy and security features we

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,590
also have a whole bunch of new features

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,220
coming out if you're into JavaScript we

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:32,250
have big int so JavaScript utilized the

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:35,490
numbers it's super flexible but you

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:38,670
can't really use big integers so big

00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:40,320
numbers and so big ants give you the

00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:43,740
option to actually have really big

00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,750
numbers one thing to keep in mind is you

00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,450
can't use big and a number

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,100
interchangeably so you have to really be

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:55,010
specific if you know you're gonna be

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:58,800
using integer we also have dark mode

00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:01,980
basically this allows you to preserve

00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,600
someone's color settings so if they're

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,520
browsing in dark mode it won't get

00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,860
overwritten it's actually show sort of

00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,170
the difference in Bugzilla which is the

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,430
Mozilla bug tracking tool they have dark

00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,170
mode and then you have the light mode in

00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,200
the middle so it actually allows people

00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:18,120
to preserve if you're browsing in dark

00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,440
mode I'd like to have a dark screen or

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,990
conversely you like to have a light we

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,190
also have CSS scrolls snapping this is

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,220
really similar to the function you see

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:31,350
in most mobile apps where it snaps to

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,210
the scroll and doesn't sort of do the

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,870
repositioning

00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:39,510
it's a really nice CSS feature and then

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:43,830
we have a ton of stuff happening in our

00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:45,900
what yeah Firefox dev tools so our

00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,450
JavaScript debugger and web console have

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,940
been improved quite a bit they're a lot

00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,640
faster more streamlined have a ton of

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,490
new improvements I'm not going to talk a

00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,800
lot about our CSS tools because one of

00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:02,640
our other speakers HJ is gonna go into

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,160
detail but we've done a lot of work on

00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,980
design tools for CSS in our dev tools if

00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,090
you do any CSS or interested in I highly

00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,610
recommend you check them out because

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:14,160
they are awesome a grid inspector is one

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:16,200
so if you're using CSS grid you actually

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,960
can inspect the whole grid and see how

00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,790
it's going to be laid out we also have

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:26,400
shape path editor so you can actually

00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:28,950
see that we have a fonts panel so you

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,450
can actually see the changes that your

00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:35,160
fonts get made as you're working in the

00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:36,960
CSS in real time we have a flexbox

00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,020
inspector so as you're doing flexbox

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,130
again you can see in the browser all the

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,370
changes that you're making and what

00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:47,100
impact they're going to have and then

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,290
the really cool one changes panel so

00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,450
inside of the dev tools you can actually

00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:53,790
see all the changes that you've made so

00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:55,080
if you've been making adjustments of

00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,340
changing things around trying to figure

00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,260
out what's going on your code it's

00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:02,010
actually recorded here so you can see

00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:06,270
what you were doing we've also improved

00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:07,590
the rules panel you can't see it but

00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,840
there's an icon that's really hard to

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:12,830
see in here there's an icon that

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,830
actually shows when you've made changes

00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:20,400
and we have accessibility checks so this

00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:23,820
again will show when your colors are

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,970
correct or not correct so it really

00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,740
helps making sure that when you're

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:31,590
showing things for people who have low

00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:35,000
visibility it actually gives you advice

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,000
for the better way to do that

00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,830
consumer features and Firefox that are

00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:43,200
kind of cool we've just turned on

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,849
enhanced tracking protection so what

00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:49,749
this does is by default will

00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:54,129
Lock known people who are doing bad

00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:56,139
things with tracking so it is enabled by

00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:58,270
default if you are a news or a Firefox

00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:00,939
you can actually turn it on if you're

00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,259
already using Firefox in the next couple

00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:03,849
of months we'll be rolling this out as a

00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:07,029
default for the next time people update

00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:08,379
their browser so it's really making sure

00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:10,929
that we're protecting people as they're

00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:15,309
browsing we also have Facebook

00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:17,529
containers this actually is a tool that

00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:19,569
we've built so that if you're browsing

00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:21,189
Facebook it puts it literally in a

00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:23,139
container so that they cannot track you

00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:26,919
across to other websites when you're

00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:28,779
browsing on Facebook and then we also

00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:30,279
have side by side profiles so for a long

00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:33,639
time you had to pick you can either use

00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:35,050
nightly or you could use the release

00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:36,669
version of Firefox you can actually now

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,619
have multiple profiles so you can have

00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:40,719
nightly you can have dev tool developer

00:07:38,619 --> 00:07:42,819
edition you can have release firefox so

00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:44,529
as you're testing you can actually go

00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:46,719
across all those and see the differences

00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:49,659
in each one of the browsers and then we

00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:52,209
have odd I am having a really hard time

00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:53,680
talking it must be all the jetlag and I

00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:57,639
just got in last night so I'm still a

00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,059
little a little under slept the audio

00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:02,529
play blocking so that turns

00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:05,259
automatically blocks videos from playing

00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:10,209
sound when you open a new tab which is

00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:13,689
really awesome and that is a super fast

00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:16,899
look at what's new in Firefox and I'm

00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:20,729
going to let reaching talk in detail

00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:20,729
about our dev tools thank you

00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:27,850
you

00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,850
