hello so who here is excited about grid

00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:17,380
CSS grid having seen it a bit of it from

00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:19,690
Rachel I have been thinking a lot about

00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,430
what we're gonna be doing with those

00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,710
design with those with that technology

00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,330
once we have it with the technology grid

00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,790
flexbox all the other things that have

00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:31,000
come along it's going to be much easier

00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,800
to code layouts the same old layouts

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,660
that everybody's been designing but it's

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,609
also going to be very easy to do

00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,670
completely different layouts in a way

00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:42,070
that's been tough for a while so what

00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,739
kinds of designs do we want to do this

00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,489
has brought me to an obsession with

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:50,620
graphic design history and art direction

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,960
but I have to say I for the longest time

00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,819
didn't really know what art direction is

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,289
I thought I knew what art direction is I

00:00:54,819 --> 00:01:00,219
mean our direction is the job that that

00:00:56,289 --> 00:01:04,600
guy does right goes to meetings directs

00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:09,759
the art make sure everything stays on

00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:11,110
brand right like ok and then I was

00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:12,759
working on this project with some really

00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,469
great people and I had this sort of

00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:16,420
breakthrough this epiphany about what

00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:18,579
art direction really is about then it's

00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,090
about having a conversation with the

00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,579
audience

00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,320
it's about intentionally deciding what

00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:25,810
that conversation should be and then

00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,060
using the visual design to have that

00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,920
conversation so here I just gave you

00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,259
four slides right there were types of in

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,460
have Etica why because it's about

00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:36,640
graphic design and you're supposed to

00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,289
always use automatic oh right like I

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,539
just put a light bulb it's goofy why

00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:42,369
would I put a cuz I had an idea like I

00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:44,680
made this slide yellow to match my light

00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:46,869
bulb like that's silly so but meanwhile

00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,909
while you were looking at those slides

00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:51,490
you had a reaction to it whether it was

00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:53,049
conscious or subconscious and I was

00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,789
starting to give you a feeling about

00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:56,289
what this talk is going to be like by

00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:59,020
using making those choices

00:01:56,289 --> 00:02:00,670
I don't like Helvetica very much I don't

00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,350
like that design style very much this is

00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,030
much more up my alley I'll stop on the

00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,619
street and you know just randomly take

00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,470
pictures like this because I find this

00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:12,640
so beautiful so how should I typeset

00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:15,190
this deck maybe I'll pick this of the

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,629
default the keynote templates right

00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,060
because it kind of matches my personal

00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:19,370
aesthetic

00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,900
a bit more but what does that say about

00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,959
what I'm gonna tell you today this is

00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,760
really sort of weak and whispery and

00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:27,980
it's not it's not an arts and crafts

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,989
presentation and like what I would be

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,690
giving you the wrong Association so this

00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:34,250
is much better choice this has the kind

00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,739
of association with the things that I

00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,720
want to talk about today and that

00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,640
process of thinking through well what

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,140
associations do I want to make you're

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,640
not choosing a typeface that never

00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,590
existed before you're not going to lay

00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,420
something out in a dimension that has

00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,580
never been accessible everything we're

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,650
doing is tapping into things that have

00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,750
been seen before and it's creating an

00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,489
association with other other work other

00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,880
people other things that people have

00:02:55,489 --> 00:03:00,440
seen editorial design is another really

00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,610
great way to think about this there's

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,739
this book that I really like called

00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,950
editorial design where they said in it

00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:09,410
the vast majority of editorial has at

00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:12,470
its heart the idea of communicating an

00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,810
idea of a story through the organization

00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:19,459
and presentation of words and visuals

00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:21,109
the idea of communicating the idea of

00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:23,060
the story so you have to first identify

00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:24,709
what's the idea of the story what's the

00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,269
idea of this site what's the idea of

00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:29,209
this app and then find ways to

00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:31,640
communicate that and you might think

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,470
well I'm not doing editorial I'm special

00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,620
I'm making an app apps or different

00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,569
websites suck apps are better so none of

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,510
this applies to me no actually in these

00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:45,140
two computer programs as we used to call

00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:46,730
them they have very little content on

00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,530
the page there's very little here but

00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,760
they're very different by the choices

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,350
they make between the layout and the

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,700
color and the typography the one of the

00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:55,250
life Google Docs kind of gives you this

00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,260
feeling of I'm sturdy I'm here for you

00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,489
I'm gonna stick around we're the one on

00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:02,959
the right sort of gives you this feeling

00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:04,519
of hello important writer we're gonna

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,859
quiet everything and you can have a

00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:08,680
chance to really focus and write very

00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:11,810
different feelings from those choices

00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:15,139
the idea of communicating an idea of a

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:17,150
story so in this book there's an example

00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:18,859
I like this this is a magazine layout I

00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:21,169
haven't actually read this article but I

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:23,479
can see there it says China speed

00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:25,760
building the future there's these

00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:27,680
photographs of architecture so this

00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,419
seems like a story about architecture in

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,199
China and the amazing things that are

00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:32,749
happening

00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,699
the feeling in the photos and then the

00:04:32,749 --> 00:04:37,039
feeling with the layout and the way the

00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:39,409
text kind of stands up like buildings

00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:42,139
and the space between the photos and the

00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:44,270
text also making lines all of that sort

00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:46,490
of gives you this feeling of like yeah

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,550
something awesome is going on here and

00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:51,229
then look at the website website doesn't

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,610
give you that a feeling at all the

00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:56,150
website can kind of gives you a feeling

00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:59,120
of clutter and chaos I can't even tell

00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,740
or guess what this would be about why is

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,210
that happening I think it's happening

00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,249
because for the longest time we were

00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,889
stuck in a rut of assuming that every

00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:10,370
website is supposed to be laid out like

00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:13,069
this or more recently like this

00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,870
we are unique find out how unique this

00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:16,849
is the part where you talk about how

00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:19,279
unique you are is a business but your

00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:21,349
website is exactly the same right or

00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,550
this tweet John Gould which of these two

00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:26,419
possible websites are you currently

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:27,680
designing somehow layout became this

00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:29,810
multiple choice question that we all

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,610
just keep choosing one of the layouts

00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,599
that's on the Shelf out of the six so

00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,580
that we're supposed to be using and

00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:36,289
we're totally bored we're bored our

00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,419
audiences are bored everybody's bored

00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:41,360
there's a lot of power that you could

00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:43,969
use and leverage by using our direction

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,349
by using unique layouts that is just

00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,719
waiting it's sitting there waiting for

00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:50,360
you to snatch up that power there's an

00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:53,479
amazing future coming here's the

00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,219
official timeline we start with you know

00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:56,599
layout layout then when you switch the

00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:58,129
table based layouts we switch the hand

00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:59,330
coded float based layouts when you

00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:01,009
switch the floats and we get these

00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,270
framework layouts we're sort of obsessed

00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:04,310
with frameworks right now that's the

00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,289
that's the error we're in but I think

00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,599
frameworks are about to go away in a big

00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:11,749
way and then we're gonna have a Yuna

00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:13,610
kitten flying around bringing us the

00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:15,529
amazing feature I'm going to show you

00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,930
some examples they are all right now at

00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:19,550
labs Jen Simmons comm there's also some

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,509
links up on the top of that page that go

00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,330
to some videos that I'll talk about

00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:26,930
later I just want to show you a few

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:29,659
properties that are pretty exciting that

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,069
are not CSS grid but also contribute to

00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:32,389
what you can do with layout and

00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:34,159
contribute to what you can do with art

00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:35,629
direction one of them is initial letter

00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:38,959
how many people have heard of initial

00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:42,810
letter quite a few of you how people

00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:46,380
have used initial letter like seven

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:49,680
okay so in graphic design one of the

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:52,530
things that we do is have big caps

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,050
either sticking up or dropping down it

00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:57,120
helps guide the eye of the reader it

00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,520
also means that you don't have to put

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,740
the very beginning of the text at the

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,750
very top of the page right in this

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,730
design actually the very top left is a

00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,470
photo and the headline is over on the

00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,150
right and the text starts way down

00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,860
towards the bottom but people don't get

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,660
confused they have no problem figuring

00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,220
out where to put their eye because

00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,190
there's a giant driver cap and it shows

00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,810
them exactly where to start reading

00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:20,600
we've tried to do top cups on the web

00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,680
they don't work very well by just

00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,540
isolating the first letter using a

00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,080
pseudo element and then making it bigger

00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:29,130
by using texts font sizing because it's

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,090
always a little different in every

00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,530
browser and you end up with this

00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,000
inconsistencies where things don't

00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,090
really line up I like the one on the

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,500
right because they were just like yeah

00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,820
it's not gonna line up ever so we're

00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,360
just gonna make a big space and call it

00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:44,850
art okay but initial letter is going to

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,380
let you line things up perfectly here in

00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,330
this example I've got a little letter

00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:50,160
for that last line of code and it makes

00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,800
the letter the height of four lines of

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,780
text then if the font doesn't download

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,310
if the user enlarges the text if

00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,080
somebody else comes along and changes

00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,270
the CSS and they adjust the line height

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,130
it doesn't matter the computer computers

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,660
are really good at math get the computer

00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,710
to do the math of figuring out how big

00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,669
the letter should be right

00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:11,100
very simple property to use but what's

00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:12,690
going to happen in browsers where they

00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,400
don't understand initial letter right if

00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,900
you use the principles of progressive

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,700
enhancement you use the kinds of things

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,910
the way of working that Jeremy was

00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:23,039
talking about yesterday what happens

00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:25,110
when a browser doesn't understand CSS it

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,120
just skips those lines I like to think

00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,860
of it it's a bit like crossing the mouse

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,510
right so cross out those two lines

00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,620
deactivate them and what do you get oh

00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:36,060
oh you get that that's not good I don't

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,310
want to have this little tiny orange

00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,050
letter with a awkward margin on it those

00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:42,599
other properties need to never be

00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:45,260
applied unless I'm using initial letter

00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,520
so what are we going to do about that

00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,839
this is what we can do about it we can

00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,630
use a feature Aquarion

00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,640
at support statement it's a conditional

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,760
so that I say add support initial letter

00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,110
in this case I use an or and I also

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,970
I'll support initial letter webkit

00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:04,820
because I'm using the prefix and you can

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,500
see that all the code that's inside this

00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,570
support statement is only going to run

00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,160
if those conditions are true if the

00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,770
conditions are false it's going to skip

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,860
the whole statement and if the browser

00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:18,380
ie doesn't understand at supports it

00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,420
also skips the entire block it doesn't

00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,430
throw an error it doesn't stop rendering

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,470
the page you can count on the browser to

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,270
gracefully degrade and so you can go

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,910
ahead and use this code today even

00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:32,630
though the only browser that supports

00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:33,920
initial letter is Safari 9 and 10 it

00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,630
will just look like this you'll hide in

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,070
the top picture you get in most browsers

00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,380
you get the experience on the top and

00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,150
then the browser in Safari 9 and 10 you

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,530
get the experience towards the bottom by

00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,990
the way we're putting this right now

00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:46,550
into Firefox and it's Jeremy Chen who's

00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:51,760
here from Taipei he's the engineer

00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:53,750
working on it so yeah Thank You Jeremy

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,040
he was showing me yesterday it's like

00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,900
half baked right now he's showing it to

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,510
me yesterday is awesome but feature

00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,880
query is huge tool that people should

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,110
start considering using start using this

00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,700
is to what it looks like support at

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,290
supports property and value you put a

00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,790
bunch of CSS and I think that this is

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,700
going to be really important as we start

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:12,590
to use grid because it's going to let us

00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:15,010
put a layout for older browsers who

00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:17,570
don't understand grid and then inside

00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:20,170
supports display grid we're going to be

00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:22,670
able to start writing code for grid and

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:24,770
using other things like margins and

00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:26,150
padding in color and tuck size and

00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:29,210
whatever we might want to combine that

00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:31,220
grid layout with in order to have a

00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:33,110
amazing layout for grid and we don't

00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,210
have to wait until every browser that

00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:36,440
every user we have has grid because

00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,180
honestly what's it's gonna take like

00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:42,560
eight years before every single solitary

00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:44,180
user updates their browser very quickly

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,300
I think within one year you'll have like

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,660
you know 60% 80% maybe of users who have

00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,130
great

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,770
you're still gonna care about the other

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:54,470
20% or the other 10% or 5% so this is I

00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:56,210
think what is gonna get us there I've

00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,500
written quite a long article at the hex

00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,780
blog about how to use feature queries

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,130
it's showing you exactly how to use them

00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:04,510
even though they're not supported in

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:06,800
every browser so check that out

00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,970
viewport units is another technology

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,060
that is pretty exciting

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:14,790
in this example the header which has

00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:17,010
this photo in the background is always a

00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:19,530
hundred percent of the height of the

00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,210
browser window no matter how big the

00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:24,540
device is or how big the browser window

00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:26,430
is how does that happen it's happening

00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,470
because I'm using the header element and

00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,420
I'm putting a height of a hundred VH on

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,740
that header element I'm telling it to

00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,330
always be a hundred percent of the

00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,150
viewport height there's no JavaScript on

00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:38,840
this example so no matter what goes on

00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:41,310
it's gonna fit it's gonna be responsive

00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,100
viewport units any place that you might

00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,840
use an M of Ram a percent or pixel any

00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,030
sort of measurements whether you're

00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,040
sizing type or you're measuring us the

00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:52,530
size of something you can use a viewport

00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,300
unit vhv W viewport height and width or

00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:56,190
view min and Max which are like the it

00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,570
evaluates to see which one's smaller and

00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,550
which ones bigger and it picks either

00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,600
the bigger or the smaller one we can do

00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:04,710
some very interesting things with this

00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,180
you know have you ever been in a meeting

00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,410
or your designers have been in a meeting

00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,850
or content people have been in a meeting

00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,800
where everybody wants their stuff above

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,200
the fold and we've been trying to tell

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,180
everybody there is no fold stop talking

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,830
about the fold we can't control the yeah

00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:21,120
you know what actually we can now

00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:23,040
control the fold but what it means is we

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,360
can size things and of course you've got

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,860
to realize that sometimes the screen is

00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,150
really really small so you need to work

00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,890
responsibly and figure out what that

00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,240
means but especially if you're doing

00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,620
something that has a lot of white space

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,940
or you have some sort of data

00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,800
visualization you have some sort of

00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,020
object kind of thing going on if you'd

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,390
like the size or more for constrain that

00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:41,430
into the space that's actually within

00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:45,090
the viewport at any given moment you can

00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:47,700
do that now object fit is really

00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,350
interesting so image is right it used to

00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,880
be we just put an image on a web page we

00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,440
sized it to the size that we wanted and

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,230
we went on with life back when the days

00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,580
were simple now we make our image is

00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,500
much bigger than they need to be and

00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,900
then we use CSS to resize them and we

00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:05,520
use width 100% or in this case I think

00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:06,720
is with 50% to make the image grow with

00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,270
the space that's available that's

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,130
awesome responsive images responsive web

00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:13,200
design using images then the height

00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,820
automatically grows at the same time

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,200
well maybe you don't want that maybe you

00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,970
really want the height to be the same

00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,930
well what can you do about that so here

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:23,240
I did that I kept the height and then

00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:26,510
oh look I'm squishing great hoppers face

00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,550
that's not I don't want that I would

00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,110
like to be able to specify the size of

00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:32,390
the image in two dimensions at the same

00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:35,149
time and not squish the aspect ratio of

00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:37,279
the photo guess what there's a new

00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:40,010
property it's called object fit and

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:43,070
using object fit cover cover as the

00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:45,290
value you can accomplish this where it's

00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:47,839
going to slide the image and crop it and

00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,100
you can actually this is cropping based

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,630
on the center point you can move that

00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,860
points around a lot like we've been able

00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,089
to do this with background for quite a

00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,020
while but now you can start doing it

00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:58,550
with the content images so here I've got

00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:02,450
there's the code for it without 50%

00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:07,040
height 400 pick pixels tall object fit

00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:08,120
cover and it means that we can start to

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,160
use when we start to use some of these

00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,050
other layout mechanisms like flexbox and

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,290
grid and you start to want to set things

00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:17,480
to be a certain size vertically which we

00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,810
haven't been doing you've got some more

00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,730
tools to be able to do stuff with that

00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:24,560
and the big big things that are

00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,779
happening multi-column flexbox and grid

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,470
right these are the three big or the two

00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:31,850
big flexbox and grid that are really

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,320
exciting and coming up I'm just going to

00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:36,680
talk about stance is great today because

00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,120
time is so short Rachel was telling you

00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:41,000
all about it here we go you know you've

00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,910
got the ability to do a layout in two

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,320
dimensions and have the bottom row in

00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,600
this case unlike flexbox

00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,730
put the items underneath the columns of

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,950
the other things we're used to thinking

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:54,230
about the world as 12 symmetrical

00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:58,040
columns 12 columns of the same size the

00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:59,839
ratio is 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 right but

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,610
we don't have to do it that way we can

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,100
actually have columns and grid makes

00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:09,020
this incredibly easy where the columns

00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:11,480
are based on a golden ratio 1 to 1.6 or

00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,579
where one column is a fixed size and

00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,620
pixels and another column is flexible

00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,630
and squishy and in another column is

00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,579
based on the size of the content that's

00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,930
inside the column you can mix those

00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:23,270
things together in a way that's

00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,070
incredibly hard to do using any tool we

00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,870
have today maybe you can accomplish it

00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,459
with calc but otherwise you're sort of

00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,620
stuck with only using percents or only

00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:33,440
using a certain technique in this case

00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,030
you can mix and match we're also used to

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,990
by using

00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,130
bootstrap and the other sorts of

00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,470
frameworks all of them all the way back

00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:41,200
to 960 dodgy yes we used to thinking

00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:43,270
about the world where the content is the

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,920
size of the cellar is the size of the

00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:46,630
track the track is the content the

00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,700
content is the track but Ingrid it's

00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,040
really different where the track is the

00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,800
size that it's being told to be if you

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,330
use that technique and the content can

00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,400
fit inside of it or maybe the whole

00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,960
track is being sized but one piece of

00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,440
content but there's other content also

00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:04,270
in the track that could be smaller also

00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,610
all the content doesn't have to be up

00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:10,210
against the top right a left corner like

00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:13,150
it can be centered or it can be aligned

00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:15,820
to the bottom or to the left using the

00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,770
alignment property which Rachel was

00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,420
talking about at the luncheon

00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:21,160
specification where we know from flexbox

00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,560
justified content aligned content online

00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,560
self and aligned items but there's two

00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,660
more being added that both go with grid

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,190
so we got justified content aligned

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,350
Content justify self aligned self

00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:34,420
justify I times a line items so if you

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:36,400
want some homework from this and you we

00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,210
mean please do try out grid but if

00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,420
nothing else

00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:42,700
go play flexbox froggie and flex box

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,320
defense because you're it's gonna take a

00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,330
while to memorize what all those things

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,000
are that's kind of confusing and like we

00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:52,960
is it justified just a line item self

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,600
would like so we nail it just drill

00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,870
yourself it's a good skill to build up

00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,940
because it's going to come in handy it

00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:06,000
means as well though that we can say

00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:09,100
that box the big squarish gray box is in

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,990
it's being placed into an area that's of

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,600
four cells and then it's being centered

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:15,490
in those cells great also means that we

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,610
don't have to put things up against the

00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:21,130
top of the page floats I think it floats

00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:22,720
like a bathtub full of bars of soap

00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:24,250
where every bar of soap is floating up

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,690
to the top of the page and no matter

00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,070
what you do you rearrange things at a

00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,960
breakpoint all all the bars or soap -

00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:31,030
sort of regional themselves it's very

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,950
hard to get things to push down and

00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:34,330
because of that we've had 20 years of

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,800
web design where everything is sort of

00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,780
just shoved up against the top of the

00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,480
page you don't have to do that with grid

00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:44,500
you can space things out by using rows

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,610
grid has rows there are many many many

00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,870
ways to use CSS grid that are very

00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,520
different than the tools that we've been

00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,920
using so not only do I encourage you to

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,540
stop using those tools and I encourage

00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,490
you to not be one of these people who

00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,049
goes makes goes and makes a new third

00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:59,780
party framework that's better because it

00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:02,890
uses CSS grid like know go make another

00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:07,790
game for learning alignment properties

00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:09,679
don't make a framework CSS grid is a

00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:12,410
framework is Rachel Andrew has said it's

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,760
it is a framework in the browser you

00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,280
don't need to build a framework on top

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,740
of the framework so I've been looking at

00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,380
a lot of books here's a poster that I

00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:24,799
saw the one on the right and I thought

00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:29,780
oh my gosh grid whitespace could I build

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:31,820
that yes so that's the web page doesn't

00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:35,510
look like a web page but that's a web

00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:37,940
page laid out using CSS grid very simple

00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:39,620
layout actually and the first thing I

00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,770
did when I did this layout is I figured

00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:44,240
out my content order it's most it's

00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,020
important to figure out the order of the

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,450
content first

00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:50,120
what is the HTML what is the order if I

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,710
had no CSS at all the CSS fell off the

00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,870
page and there are many reasons that it

00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,640
does screen readers is one of them using

00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,530
something like Instapaper or pocket or

00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,840
read it later is another if someday we

00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:01,669
wake up an Alexa and Cortana and Siri

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,429
start reading web pages aloud to us like

00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:06,320
the order of the HTML matters it's also

00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:07,640
in just a nice constraint put it in the

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,049
correct order and then you can go on

00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,120
with your life you might say that like

00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:13,309
Jazz at Lincoln Center is the boat logo

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,380
is first and then the headline the title

00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:17,150
of the website is second I got this word

00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,280
schedule of events which never shows up

00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,140
on the finished product it only shows up

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,410
in the HTML then it's displays it's

00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:27,530
hidden and I did a float based layout

00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:29,000
kind of simple maybe a little awkward I

00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:30,799
could have spent more time on this if I

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,360
wanted to made it a little more polished

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,830
or maybe this is appropriate because it

00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,260
is about jazz and that kind of like

00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:39,650
whatever is very jazz like right so why

00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:41,419
not go with that and then I used feature

00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:43,070
queries to target browsers that

00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:45,110
understand graded to give them this code

00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:47,059
a little bit of undoing the previous

00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:52,900
styling and then applying the new

00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:54,890
styling overall I feel like grid

00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:59,330
everything we've been doing so far with

00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:00,150
layout frameworks you place items onto

00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,800
the grid and you can

00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:03,060
do that with grid you can place items on

00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,190
to the grid and then you can use

00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,900
breakpoints and change the placement of

00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,090
those items onto the grid the example I

00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,820
just showed you is done that way you can

00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:14,460
also let grid place things for you you

00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,960
can do know you can stay say nothing

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,610
about where you want things to go and

00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,110
grid its gonna start playing late laying

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:21,780
them out for you and that might be great

00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:23,340
you can also do a combination where some

00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,470
of the items you've told grid where to

00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,210
put it and then it lays the rest of them

00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,950
out using the auto placement algorithm

00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:30,540
and that is another thing that's hard

00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,070
and tricky to start that you like really

00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,180
changes your thinking about how this

00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:37,140
stuff works here's an example that works

00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,060
by using a hundred percent auto

00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,580
placement it's a very classic a bunch of

00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:43,290
squares right this is a layout that we

00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,490
do all the time it's this particular one

00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:47,640
wouldn't be hard to do with floats you

00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:49,110
could also do this with Flex box this is

00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,690
the markup that I've got so just a bunch

00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:54,600
of images in a row

00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:58,080
there's my CSS that's seven lines of CSS

00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,640
that is all of the CSS for this entire

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,910
example that's not a little bit of it

00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:05,460
that's all of it and all of the layout

00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:07,740
CSS for that example is here two lines

00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:10,850
of code display grid grid template

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,720
columns repeat autofit big max 282 1fr

00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:14,220
complicated I don't have time to explain

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,880
it it's Rachel was talking a little bit

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:20,400
about this as well one line of code

00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,630
defines your grid and all the items get

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,100
placed automatic why would you need a

00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:25,200
framework for this you just write this

00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,300
it's pretty awesome the auto placement

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,620
algorithm this is a lot like this

00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,060
drawing sort of illustrates the point

00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,760
that Rachel was making earlier where

00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:34,230
some of the items all of the items are

00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,910
getting placed automatically some of

00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:39,000
them I've told them to be bigger and so

00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,740
with leaving gaps or I can use grid auto

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,390
float dents and it will take those items

00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:47,000
and rearrange them so that there are no

00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:48,810
gaps it fills things back in this design

00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,920
Piet Mondrian

00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:54,990
very famous this whole art movement this

00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,850
whole era this time in this period of

00:21:54,990 --> 00:22:00,150
time was about experimenting and seeing

00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:02,430
what could be done with a fresh modern

00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:04,410
take on society in a fresh modern take

00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:06,540
on design industrial design graphic

00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:08,190
design it was a reaction to the sort of

00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,800
embellishments of the Victorians and it

00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,880
was a it was a way to artistically

00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,250
express what was happening in the

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,500
Industrial Revolution switching from an

00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:20,470
agricultural society to a very mechanic

00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,790
mechanical society and I feel like these

00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,140
paintings you know if you look at them

00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,460
with the sense of like why is that

00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,080
important I could have done that it's

00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,970
like well yeah you could paint that

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,530
today because we're so used to this kind

00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:31,360
of thinking but would you have painted

00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:33,400
this when everything around you was

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,720
Victorian when everything around you was

00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:39,580
this other style and I think some of

00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,820
what these paintings are about is really

00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,410
exploring what happens when you draw a

00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,940
bunch of boxes of different shapes and

00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:48,220
sizes on a grid what happens when you

00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,060
put a bunch of color in them what does

00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:52,000
that feel like

00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:54,880
where does your eye go first what is

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,530
that overall what's the impression that

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,790
that gives off and those are the

00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:00,040
questions I think we need to be asking

00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:03,280
about the web at this moment so I wanted

00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,810
to turn this into a web project of

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,550
websites and I spent quite a while

00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,720
figuring out well what's the HTML for

00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,040
this at first I thought that those would

00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,980
all be color blocks and sort of

00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:14,530
background images but then I realized no

00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,090
actually if I do that it says i HT M L

00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:19,360
is a bunch of empty divs that's not

00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:21,370
right I don't want empty dibs so really

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,680
I want my screen reader experience to be

00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:26,650
a poem that is a list of colors that

00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:29,740
makes sense so I took the drone the

00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:32,050
painting and chopped it up into a each

00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:36,100
color block I put a black border around

00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:37,330
each one and then I there you can see

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,690
that right there's just a stack of

00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:47,160
images then I laid them out using CSS

00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:47,160
grid and then I made it responsive

00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,400
and it's fascinating I have another

00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,460
example that you can look at it labs

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,320
done Simmons that come the lot of those

00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:04,850
paintings were done in a diamond shape

00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,640
to kind of explore what does a diamond

00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,620
do so I just clip paths to chop the

00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,880
thing into a diamond you can start to

00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,500
see what happens is everything slides

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,350
around behind the cup at the clipped

00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,120
path of the diamond what is it that's

00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:19,520
what are you gonna get what kind of

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,500
impression will your site give if each

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,670
one of those blocks was content if each

00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,040
one of those was like another newspaper

00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:26,860
article or another part of the UI for

00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,300
your application or whatever right

00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,950
here's an example right so just get you

00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,390
an idea of Victorian the look and feel

00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:35,270
from the Victorian era with stuff like

00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:37,310
this right in some ways I feel like the

00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:41,510
Victorians are a lot like the people who

00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:44,990
love bootstrap because everything was

00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:46,760
folded in half like this symmetrical

00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:50,180
everything so symmetrical and everything

00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:51,740
all like and then these movements came

00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,880
along about house was one of them

00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,380
there's a bad house Museum here in

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,670
Germany if you only Berlin if you want

00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,740
to check it out and totally going over

00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:59,540
there next a couple days but there were

00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,420
things happening all over this part of

00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,220
Europe lots and lots of different people

00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,690
some of which are got more credit and

00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,970
Fame than others but there were quite a

00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:10,840
few and they were doing things like this

00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:13,580
what happens when you turn things on a

00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:16,250
diagonals if you use giant blocks of red

00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:18,500
what happens if you use heavy liens and

00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:20,000
turn your words sideways what kinds of

00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,220
feelings do you get how does this

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,180
contrast of what had come before this

00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:28,130
one is my favorite this is before

00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:29,660
photograph fear came out before offset

00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:32,960
printing got done and before things were

00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:35,600
done using foot film to prepare plates

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,090
for press this was done still in the era

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,280
where everything was handset type metal

00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:42,500
type and all the lines and everything

00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,780
that you might get were other pieces of

00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,370
metal so this is this is a person

00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,810
collecting a bunch of those pieces of

00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,490
metal and figuring out how to make an

00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:51,020
art project and like taking the thing

00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:53,330
that you can't really do much with and

00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:55,190
just turning it 45 degrees and blocking

00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:56,810
it in with wooden metal at 45 degrees

00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,460
like really pushing the boundaries of

00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:02,600
what was possible given the technology

00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:04,610
that they had so I have this website the

00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,240
labs website this is the top of the page

00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,860
now

00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,140
if you go to it in a normal pretty

00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:11,059
people browser it looks like this this

00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:13,039
isn't it might fall back lay out this is

00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:13,850
my base experience like Jeremy talked

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,649
about yesterday

00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:17,390
you can read the text and it's typeset

00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:18,440
in future like there you go I could do

00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,850
some more could you know put some

00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,070
borders and some colors on this but I

00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:23,690
kind of like it very simple and then if

00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,850
you go to it in a browser that has grid

00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,890
enabled or like Firefox nightly an

00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:32,870
experimental browser you get this

00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:36,529
experience it's using writing modes to

00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:39,110
turn the text and transform rotate to

00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:40,940
turn the entire block which is really a

00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:42,529
good choice writing modes gets you a way

00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,000
to turn text much more easily than if

00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:48,080
you were using transform rotate to turn

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:54,580
that text and so and it's also totally

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:54,580
responsive why is my video not playing

00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:04,450
save it place anyway you can look at it

00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:06,520
yourself it at smaller screen sizes it's

00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:08,230
good straight again and then the things

00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,850
rearrange themselves at different sizes

00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:12,730
in order to fit into the space that's

00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:15,670
available here we go yeah

00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:17,260
you get the idea so when and where is

00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:19,060
this all available it's you know it

00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:21,040
looks like it's sad and depressing and

00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,840
nobody has grid and nobody's building

00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,370
grid but that is not the truth everybody

00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,290
is working on the grid very very very

00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:28,930
hard right now and I expect to have it

00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:30,850
come out in a pretty spectacular way and

00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:32,460
to catch the industry off-guard because

00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,930
we're used to things coming out like

00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,550
gradients where it kept getting changed

00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:38,080
and it turned into a mess or flexbox

00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:40,480
kept getting changed and it turned into

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,380
a mess grid kept getting changed in

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,600
secret

00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:45,580
you just didn't know and it's all gonna

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,200
be done and fully baked and when we pull

00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:50,580
the cake out of the oven it's gonna work

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,510
instead of it being kind of a crazy mess

00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:55,060
Firefox nightly is one of my favorite

00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:56,290
ways to find out where it's just a doubt

00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:58,360
like you don't have to flip the flag

00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:00,400
it's easy just use it also nightly has

00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:04,180
this really awesome add-on that patch

00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:06,220
and I made for you where you can use it

00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:08,560
to you've click the little button and

00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:10,570
then you can see the grids it can be

00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,100
very hard to learn grid and understand

00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:14,230
what you're doing when you're not really

00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,430
sure like things aren't where you

00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:18,460
thought they would be and you don't know

00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:20,680
if it's you or if it's the browser or

00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,240
like you don't know why it's broken it's

00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,830
very it helps a lot to be able to see

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,340
the lines to figure out why it's broken

00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:29,260
so check out that add-on so how are we

00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:34,420
going to use any of these technologies

00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:35,770
when IE still exists there's this idea

00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,270
that we have some times where things

00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,740
either work or they don't work and you

00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:40,660
can use them or they don't use you can

00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,790
choose not to use them and so you get

00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,870
this matrix and you want to use it

00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:46,120
because you want it to work but it

00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:48,010
doesn't work everywhere because ie so

00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,480
then you use it and it doesn't work and

00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,770
you get fired or you get covered in bugs

00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,300
and that doesn't that's not good so you

00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,010
just have to choose to never use any of

00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,990
these things but that's not good the

00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:58,630
problem is not any the problem is this

00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:00,430
box this is not the reality of what is

00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:02,350
going on this is the reality of what's

00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:04,600
going on you can use it and not use it

00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:09,820
at the same time it works and it doesn't

00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:12,220
work at the same time it's quantum CSS

00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:14,049
and this is where the communicating

00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:15,489
Lizzy unicorn kitten lives in they use

00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:17,979
it and don't use it at the same time box

00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:20,220
you don't have to decide to use it like

00:29:17,979 --> 00:29:24,789
you don't have to wait it's eight years

00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:27,309
that's the nature of CSS so you know hey

00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:29,139
5% of your people get the experience on

00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:32,229
the right it's okay they don't have you

00:29:29,139 --> 00:29:34,239
point unit support no big deal only 12%

00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:35,409
of the people see the drop cap 88% of

00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:37,679
the people see that oh they don't know

00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:38,889
that they're missing something it's fine

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,879
okay

00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:44,499
zero percent of people get to see the

00:29:42,879 --> 00:29:46,919
grid layout all right maybe you don't

00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:49,960
ship this into production yeah it's okay

00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:52,179
unless you're like me and you're showing

00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,729
other people like you but you know as

00:29:52,179 --> 00:29:56,499
soon as I don't know eight percent of

00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:58,210
browsers 10 percent twenty percent of

00:29:56,499 --> 00:30:02,440
browsers have grid maybe that's the time

00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:04,239
to start shipping I have an entire talk

00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,940
that will show you step by step by step

00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:08,649
exactly how to accomplish this kind of

00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,960
CSS that works and doesn't work at the

00:30:08,649 --> 00:30:12,489
same time I also have a talk that I gave

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,710
last year where I show many more

00:30:12,489 --> 00:30:16,149
properties and CSS and the kinds of

00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:18,340
things that we're gonna be able to do to

00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:20,710
really change our layouts and then this

00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:22,720
talk is wow this is a twenty five twenty

00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:25,090
how many minutes version of this talk

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,369
but uh there's a longer version that you

00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:29,619
can also watch online where I get into a

00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:33,090
little bit more of it all and again

00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:35,710
check this out labs and Simmons comm I

00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:37,629
really do think that it's time for us to

00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,759
be experimenting it's time for us to not

00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:40,989
only learn grid and honestly learning

00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,539
grid you're not gonna be able to learn

00:30:40,989 --> 00:30:44,259
grid over one weekends this is not

00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:46,720
border-radius

00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:48,849
grid takes quite a while to learn so if

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,669
you started learning grid casually here

00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:53,409
and there now you'll maybe understand it

00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:55,330
by February or March if it starts

00:30:53,409 --> 00:30:57,369
shipping in February in March like it

00:30:55,330 --> 00:31:00,759
took me at least six months to get my

00:30:57,369 --> 00:31:02,529
head wrapped around it so why not start

00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:04,149
now and experiments and play around

00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:05,529
you could prototype things you're

00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:07,090
working on some sort of designer your

00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:09,070
designers are working on something you

00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:11,229
can do some prototypes and grid and then

00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:15,669
toss them and redo the thing and other

00:31:11,229 --> 00:31:17,889
kinds of code later go to layout land a

00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:19,299
building a site there over the winter

00:31:17,889 --> 00:31:20,919
I'll be building this site out where

00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:23,060
we'll be able to show each other

00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:25,160
experiments and share ideas and

00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:27,290
have challenges and challenge each other

00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,090
and play around so um sign up for an

00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:30,860
email list to get info when that

00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:34,990
launches and some other info as it comes

00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,990
