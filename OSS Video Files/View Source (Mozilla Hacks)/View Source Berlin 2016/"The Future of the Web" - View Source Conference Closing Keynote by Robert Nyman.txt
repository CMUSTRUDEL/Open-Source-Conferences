Title: "The Future of the Web" - View Source Conference Closing Keynote by Robert Nyman
Publication date: 2016-10-03
Playlist: View Source Berlin 2016
Description: 
	Progressive Web Apps is more or less almost the entire web story that we're working on. It includes Service Workers, Push and more, but also for future APIs and possibilities like Payments, Credential Management, Web Bluetooth and such. Let's take a bird's-eye view on the web platform with new features, how it fits in and relates to native mobile platforms, and where it's going and how to make sure it stays relevant. 

View Source Berlin 12-14 September, 2016

hello everyone my name is Robert

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:19,350
go but I can quit whenever I want to and

00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,689
despite that or maybe because of that

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,700
I'm really happy to be invited to come

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,490
here and speak at masalas use force

00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,630
conference and especially doing it in

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,070
Germany is just what I expected it to be

00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:35,120
there's a lot of caps there's a lot of

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,800
Octans there's alarms exclamation points

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:42,510
so it's really living up to what I

00:00:37,800 --> 00:01:06,830
wanted it to be and these screens they

00:00:42,510 --> 00:01:06,830
are amazing hello what's

00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:38,060
what what's your name hi one the high

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:39,470
are you having a good time oh well thank

00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,850
you very much Wanda thank you for these

00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,850
two days and then plus one

00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:58,560
one thing that's very good to know is

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,320
it's also i'm coming from sweden and i

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,050
want to start by apologizing we might

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,580
have done a lot of harm in the world so

00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,110
if you've gone through the pain we're

00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,020
sorry we're working on it we're making

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,590
it better and another thing about sweets

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,060
as well is that we're very sort of shy

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,460
on the outside so we have a lot of

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,380
feelings on the inside but on the

00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,160
outside it doesn't really come off like

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:26,640
that so I'm really on fire on the inside

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:30,660
but it might not truly show here it's

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:34,530
just good to know so my background I've

00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:36,180
been a web developer since 99 and being

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,600
involved in a Mozilla community from

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,360
2009 and the fun background there is my

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:47,550
first international presentation I ever

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:49,770
did was for masala in Berlin in 2009 in

00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,230
another venue but but still here it was

00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,690
an extension workshop so it really kind

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,760
of feels like full circle to to get to

00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,280
come here and to speak to you today in

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:03,510
the same city in under the masala

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,870
umbrella and Lena was talking this

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:09,330
morning about heroes and like a hero

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,340
community if there's anything that I

00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,920
that I believe you need to know is that

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,200
all of you are the heroes all of you in

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,959
the community taking the time to help

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:23,570
people to share information so a big

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,570
hand for you you are heroes we're not

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:33,330
but of course everyone has a history and

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:41,020
yet me okay doesn't look like that and

00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,760
I'm not really sure what the background

00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,440
is but the only thing that I sort of

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,870
sure about when I say this fixture is

00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:50,080
that I would probably directly qualify

00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,430
into a Russian dating site so it's

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,550
always good if I ever consider my

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:57,970
options that's one way to go so

00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:00,400
currently I work for Google and working

00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:03,550
with web developer relations at Google

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,280
for all of the web platform and some of

00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,540
the areas i spend the most time with

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,670
naturally being happy to speak at

00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,380
conferences and travel around but also

00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,760
working with developer feedback how we

00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,040
can make sure that we make the web

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,750
platform better not only with with

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,459
chrome of course with across the board

00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:23,050
how can make it easier for developers

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:24,910
and an interesting part here is also

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,710
that i work from sweden from stockholm

00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,810
office and I don't have any sort of

00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,060
direct colleagues there they're all

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,960
based in London or in mountain view or

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,730
Seattle so recently we were sort of

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,229
running out of space with new desks for

00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:43,479
people so they moved me to a temp space

00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:47,110
so now I'm sitting in my own corner on

00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:50,590
floor 8 and it it kind of gives you

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:53,110
these office space labs here actually a

00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,180
funny side story here and not entirely

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,310
sure is true but when they made the

00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,840
office space movie swingline who were

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,550
producing diste foolish to actually

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,680
didn't have a red stapler like this so

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,960
the stapler was painted red in the

00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,550
movies but then after the movie it

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,530
became such a success so they have to

00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,790
start mass manufacture them so you need

00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:13,210
to sort of thank the movie for all the

00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:15,010
red staplers in your life and I'm here

00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,350
to talk about the future of the web and

00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:20,890
with that of course we need to walk talk

00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:27,400
about the web us today as well so about

00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:30,340
six years ago wired had this article and

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,169
it was an editorial and it's kind of

00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,750
tiring when you see these things and

00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:36,460
it's always like the the media thing of

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,050
trying to pick a fight or killing off

00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:42,590
technologies or or something like that

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:44,330
then a few years later the spring they

00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:47,000
had another article that apparently the

00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:50,229
webos isn't that after all new editor

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,580
and if you sort of look beyond the

00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:55,310
chrome logo or I think the web as a

00:05:52,580 --> 00:06:00,020
whole is really thriving really having a

00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:02,720
comeback right now if you only look like

00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:05,090
from our side with Google so chrome on

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,599
mobile alone in November last year it

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:11,330
had 800 million users in April this year

00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:13,909
we reach 1 billion users and that's only

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,440
one browser and only a mobile when you

00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:18,620
get in all the other browsers there as

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,389
well so there is an amazing reach and it

00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,069
just keeps on growing so it might not

00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:24,379
always get the media attention the web

00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:26,780
might not be sexy all the time but it is

00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:30,469
the thing that is both the past and the

00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:34,069
future so the web isn't dead the web is

00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:36,440
pretty far from dead actually and I

00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:38,930
think what I sort of came from was that

00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,240
for the last few years especially sort

00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,219
of around 2010 when the first editorial

00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,490
came was that the web experience on

00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:48,169
mobile was something like this you would

00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,000
get in somewhere you get a big pop up

00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:51,620
you get forced to install and after you

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:58,669
never wanted to install just to get

00:06:51,620 --> 00:07:00,949
something done and I think that that is

00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:03,349
getting better and also from like Google

00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:05,750
search results I'd websites you have

00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:07,190
these pop-ups or interstitials that

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,229
blocks the user experience right now

00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,330
we'll actually get penalized in search

00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:14,960
results so if you're having papas like

00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:17,180
that please stop and also like Chris was

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,090
talking about before today if you're

00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,620
looking at apps right now it's very few

00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,300
apps that people they actually use all

00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:26,090
the time like it's Facebook Twitter or

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,949
some other stuff instagram and and

00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,199
that's it people don't keep on it's only

00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:32,300
new apps because it's still the extra

00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,639
hurdle of finding something may be

00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,770
paying for it installing it using it

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,379
once I think of the apps that people

00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:41,120
install they only use fifty percent

00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:44,779
wraps one time and that's it and then

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,889
they never use it again and also when

00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:47,360
the first one we talked about the web

00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:50,029
and just want to keep on stressing this

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,770
of course we talk to web as all browser

00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:54,289
across the board everyone

00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,789
one everywhere should be able to be

00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:57,110
involved it shouldn't just be one

00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:58,879
browser because then we're committing

00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,970
the same mistake as we had many many

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,879
years ago and we don't want that so of

00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,500
course with that said I work at Google

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,180
so some of the things that I'll be

00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,110
covering today are things that we're

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:14,690
working with in chrome but all of them

00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,550
are either api's or features that we

00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,680
think should be out there across the web

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:21,440
so it's not something Google specific in

00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,569
that sense and also with the web as

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,199
today most of the things that we spend

00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:28,639
time on is progressive web apps

00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,889
progressive web apps is sort of like you

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,300
know the new Ajax or the new html5 or

00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:35,120
something like that it's sort of become

00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:37,610
this collective term of how can we make

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,300
the web better how can I make sure to

00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,950
cater to users needs and there are six

00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,899
quick things that I was in a read rate

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,850
and then Chris we're talking about in

00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:49,130
before today but one is having instant

00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,649
loading both for offline scenarios but

00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,630
also poor network conditions just making

00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:56,290
sure that it is as instant of an

00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:58,910
experience for the user as possible

00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:01,399
we're also talking about add to

00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:03,260
homescreen one is of course tricking the

00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:05,930
at the home screen thing within web

00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:07,279
pages with install banners and also that

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,050
you have it in the Matthews and

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,930
basically what you need is just having

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,360
the manifest file for your website and

00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:17,360
then having push notifications for

00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,370
reengagement and a really important

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,500
thing and why I have it in here is with

00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,870
notifications they are great we can see

00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,640
great numbers with how many people come

00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,680
back to websites or web apps and they

00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,160
keep on buying more things or looking at

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,750
more pages etc but be be really gentle

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,450
with it it shouldn't be deaf by

00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,610
notification so should you only be when

00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:41,589
it makes sense when they're relevant and

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:44,540
timely and they are in the right context

00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:46,490
it's also about speed and not only

00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,959
loading pages but once you're in the

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,880
page that you want to have smooth

00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:52,670
animations you want to have smooth

00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,740
scrolling and both navigation within the

00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:59,390
page and between different pages as well

00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:03,050
and secure HTTPS is basically just the

00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:04,610
way to go it might be harder beginning

00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,630
it might be a challenge but it's it's a

00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,730
lot easier now

00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:10,190
than it used to be and also looking a

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:14,330
lot of the new API is coming to the web

00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:17,360
they will require HTTPS and also last

00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:20,000
week we put a blog post out there that

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,780
for regular HTTP pages will start

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,800
putting warnings in chrome as well

00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,840
showing you search that this is not

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,340
secure we can't guarantee that

00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,280
everything is being transmitted here is

00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:33,170
being secure and the bottom one is one

00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,180
way how it might look in the futures it

00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:37,580
actually doesn't look that good so if

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:40,820
you haven't gone into a CPS yet and now

00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:43,940
it's a really good time to start and the

00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,800
final part is responsive so whatever you

00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,840
build make sure that it works on any

00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,270
kind of resolution and asks us many

00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,210
devices as possible just load the right

00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:55,760
resources so reiterating what was said

00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:58,510
before progressive web apps today are

00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,280
reliable fast engaging and secure and

00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:02,900
we've come a really long way in only the

00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:11,330
last few years with AP is and then

00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:13,340
future support so the way I see it the

00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,980
web is already all mighty powerful the

00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,020
web is amazing and I think sometimes we

00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,420
were kind of missing that because we're

00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:23,570
living with it every day at the same

00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:25,820
time it's just the beginning it's just

00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,830
kind of what's needed to play to match

00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,940
some of the native features that users

00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:34,010
have gotten used to expect so all things

00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,720
like notifications at the home screen

00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,850
off line is that are those are the first

00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:43,520
we need to do their the table stakes to

00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:46,520
be able to play on in the mobile area so

00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:50,180
what about the future I think one thing

00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:52,250
we go to conference is you can hear

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,420
about the future you can hear visions

00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,000
what it's going to be like in five years

00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,340
etc i I've no clue what it's going to be

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,720
like in five years and I'd rather have

00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,480
people going to conference hearing about

00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,370
the futures more near term like what's

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,770
happening right right now or what's

00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,080
happening in the near future or within a

00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:10,580
year so all the things i'll be talking

00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,770
about today they're not going to be

00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,570
things like robots being built out of

00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:18,110
all mobile phones or something like that

00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:21,750
i won't be talking about flying cars

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:24,170
so more things that are tangible to you

00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:27,240
so things like knowing who the user is

00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:29,040
credentials management and paying for

00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,590
things on the web which is crucial

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,180
connecting with hardware something

00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,890
called the physical web and I just

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:38,340
briefly touch on what we are because

00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:40,410
Dominic was covering that so starting

00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:43,890
with knowing who the user is right now

00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:45,630
and it's still really hard for users on

00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,950
the mobile web like if they come to a

00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,610
web page and then we need to sign in

00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:52,380
somewhere you never sort of remember

00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:53,790
what kind of log in you use to use your

00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,000
facebook account of your google account

00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:58,530
usually you know the email you're using

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,420
usually you also have no idea which

00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,620
password you were using and you didn't

00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,630
try to figure out did I actually ever

00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,760
sign up for this or I'm just trying

00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:08,790
again and then you find a magical link

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,240
the forgot password link is there anyone

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:20,070
here who haven't clicked forgot password

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:22,770
yeah okay so we have what out and also

00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:24,390
typing on mobile devices is really

00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,070
really hard as soon as you want to login

00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,650
you keep on typing something you get

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:36,090
something wrong it's just just annoying

00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:40,970
right can you guess what this is yeah so

00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:45,090
this was this was the winner in 2015 of

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:47,910
the most popular password and after a

00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:50,070
few years it actually pushed down the

00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:53,700
the previous password which was actually

00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:57,060
the word password so it's a tough game

00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,890
right there just next to each other and

00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,680
of course this post is an enormous

00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:03,420
security risk and especially with people

00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:07,640
reusing passwords across websites don't

00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:10,020
do that I know you will but don't and

00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:13,080
one way we're trying to approach it from

00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:14,250
within the browser side is building

00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,600
something called smart lock for

00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,100
passwords and just making sure that

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,190
we're saving passwords and having them

00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,410
synced across devices so only through

00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:24,390
smart flock from our side we have eight

00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,950
billion sign ins every month that goes

00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:29,070
through smart locks it's sort of being

00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:31,080
taken care of for user and generally

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,840
that takes no effort from the web

00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,420
developers or a very little effort but

00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,790
sometimes when the web browser comes to

00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:41,010
a web page it's not entirely sure which

00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:42,000
field will mean what so there's

00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,430
something called the autocomplete

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:52,470
attribute where you can specify what the

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:56,280
different things actually mean so you

00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:58,920
can use sorry you can use name telephone

00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:01,140
number user name etc to to help them and

00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,270
if you're having a sign in forum for

00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:05,250
instance you specify very clearly like

00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:07,440
this is the username this is the current

00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,690
password and why it says current

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,250
password not just password is because if

00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:14,700
you have a signup form or you know

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:17,550
forgot password form instead you have

00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:19,020
new password that's the value so

00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,640
basically with new password the browser

00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,930
won't try to auto fill it with the

00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,210
password you saved before it will

00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:26,820
actually expect a new password which is

00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:28,650
great but other interesting part of this

00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,840
like if you specify within your web page

00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:32,520
that you expect a new password from the

00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,380
users and users aren't really good at

00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,270
picking passwords it means from the

00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:39,420
browser society we can generate a much

00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:41,160
more secure password for users so

00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:44,610
instead of users having passwords like

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,080
this we can generate this I mean not

00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,930
exactly this all the time because that

00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:52,680
would kind of kill the point but a more

00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:54,630
unique and safe password for users so

00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,460
we're experimenting with in chrome of

00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,650
Audrey entering passwords you have it in

00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,990
and canarian and other versions and we

00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:03,030
hope to make it deploy to stable assume

00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,980
so basically if you have forms in web

00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,510
pages use the autocomplete attributes

00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:10,380
it's going to help all the browsers of

00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:12,000
saving information for users which

00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,490
brings me to the credentials management

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,430
API which is kind of the next generation

00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,990
for sign-in on the web we just shipped

00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,360
this in chrome its own in all browsers

00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,980
yet it's definitely coming and it allows

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,700
you as a developer to integrate with the

00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:29,190
browser's credential manager so if you

00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,810
look at aliexpress for instance they

00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,940
have a nice flow where you go into a web

00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:34,770
page and then just have automatic sign

00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,360
in so once you're in there and you've

00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:39,840
been there before you just get signed in

00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,430
and since this is a shopping part it's

00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,630
really important to have a streamlined

00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,649
experience you don't want to sort of

00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,660
block the users

00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:47,970
and a kind of hurdle and you've probably

00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,860
seen this research that for every step

00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:52,649
along the way you lose twenty percent of

00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:55,230
your users so making as easy as possible

00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:56,399
user is of course a good thing and in

00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,110
this case there's no sort of obvious

00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,519
place where you want to put it because

00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,970
that would block the experience for the

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,819
user and code wise where you do it like

00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,890
on a navigator object you have

00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:10,949
credentials object so basically you call

00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:13,919
credentials get for getting the password

00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:16,049
and one important part here is using

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,000
unmediated which means that there will

00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:20,100
be no prompt for the users there won't

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,779
be anything blocking the experience for

00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,279
them that I need to tap or file and

00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:26,309
select that they've just be done

00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:29,309
automatically for them and with

00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:31,260
automatic sign-in basically is being

00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:33,360
offered if it's enabled and if you have

00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:36,919
only one credential saved for that

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:40,409
website and again coming back to https

00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:42,600
it only works in a secure context and

00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:45,659
naturally passwords on directly exposed

00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,490
to javascript and within fetch it will

00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:51,120
only submit credentials the same site

00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:53,610
endpoint and once you've gotten the

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,940
credential from the user you can just

00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:58,590
post them to the server with fetch and

00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,679
just verify them and then sign the

00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:03,750
userid so what if that's not an option

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,779
if you want to have one top sign in

00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,549
instead and the experience is kind of

00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:10,080
similar so you come in there just choose

00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:11,520
the account you want to sign in with and

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,679
then you're in right so it's very

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,049
similar but just it needs that one tap

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:21,960
to get in and code wise it kind of looks

00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:23,880
the same the only thing that's been

00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,770
removed here is the unmediated part

00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,980
otherwise it's just the same experience

00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:31,440
and from a developer side you also want

00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,850
to be more in control of storing the

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,590
current roles for the users are being

00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:37,440
control when save the password is

00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:39,539
actually being triggered so when you're

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,549
filling things out you can get a

00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:43,740
reference to your form and then you call

00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:45,480
it call navigated credentials and just

00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:49,470
store those credentials restoring that

00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,779
form for that user and we also support

00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:57,480
federated login so if you log in with

00:18:51,779 --> 00:19:00,510
facebook or google+ or something that's

00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,770
being supported as well so and the way

00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,169
you do that you just create a new

00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,910
Federated credential object so you have

00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:08,669
a username and then you just specify

00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:12,870
which provider you're using for that log

00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:14,010
in it's quite easy actually and finally

00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:16,890
the last part of course it's also

00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:18,179
logging users out an important thing

00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,770
with logging uses out of course is

00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:21,270
making sure they don't automatically get

00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:24,270
signed in over and over and over and

00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:25,590
gets kind of in an endless loop and if

00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,030
you companies started working with this

00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:30,840
and some of these have it in production

00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:33,059
as well so I do recommend playing around

00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,740
with it and seeing kind of how it works

00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:36,299
with the automatic sign in and those

00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:40,100
flows like if it's a good experience for

00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:43,860
users or if there's something missing

00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:46,260
and once you sign in we need to take

00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:48,510
care of this part which is paying for

00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:51,270
things on the web and this is vital that

00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:53,610
we get it right I think the big success

00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:56,160
behind the app stores and native apps

00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:57,799
it's really really easy to buy an app or

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,030
in-app purchases or something like that

00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:01,679
because you know just or your credit

00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:03,419
card once and then you just keep on

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,320
buying smurfberries or something like

00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:09,990
that so on the web of course we need to

00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,090
meet that and hopefully surpass that as

00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:14,160
well and even looking where we are right

00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:16,799
now on the rise of mobile computing and

00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:20,280
most of the traffic coming from mobile

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:22,710
devices still six or six percent of the

00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:27,000
purchases on the mobile are on the web

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:29,370
not native apps mobile web so again the

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,740
web isn't really dead sixty-six percent

00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:35,190
out of however many internet users is a

00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:37,260
good number and looking at some recent

00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,809
data throughout Europe you can see that

00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:42,690
with friends Italy Spain it sort of on

00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:45,840
that level UK is a bit below and then

00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:50,820
Germany as well I don't know Germany

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:52,830
make it better please but some other

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,720
statistics as well it's also seeing the

00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,820
different kind of actions that users are

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,799
doing and what they're using for that

00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,679
one are they using a native app when are

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,360
they using the mobile web it's kind of

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,210
small I'll share the slice after so you

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,429
can look at this as well so that's all

00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:10,950
good and well but if you compare mobile

00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:13,530
web to desktop web and

00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,720
paying for things there are six to six

00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,610
fewer conversions on mobile websites

00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,560
versus desktop which basically means you

00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:22,860
only have one third as many conversions

00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:24,990
on mobile web which isn't great it's

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,330
still a crazy amount of people but it

00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:29,460
isn't great but it is pretty simple

00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:32,190
reason actually and this sort of comes

00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,430
back to again form and typing on mobile

00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:42,650
devices so have you ever banded a

00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:45,780
purchase because of the checkout form so

00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:47,940
forms on the web today and specifically

00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:50,340
on mobile there there Manuel and tedious

00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,770
and slow and it takes a certain amount

00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,970
of tabs to get through it and especially

00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,710
if you're trying to fill out a credit

00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,270
card number something like that you

00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,650
don't even get the number keyboard on

00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:00,810
your phone so you're getting to it like

00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:05,700
the extra secondary keyboard thing to

00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:07,050
try it fill it out so again sort of from

00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,460
the browser side it's always a delicate

00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:10,320
balance where you can do within the

00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:14,010
browser to solve issues and we can do

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:16,020
with AP ice or certain standards but

00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:18,000
with this we started working with auto

00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:20,490
fill so if you have something filled out

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,350
it's been saved before just autofill for

00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:25,020
user directly like it's usually like

00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:28,770
shipping address sorry addresses credit

00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:31,050
card numbers and stuff like that and the

00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:32,640
wave works is that the credit card and

00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:34,440
address is being saved into Chrome and

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,420
then we have the automatic form

00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,120
detection which is around a ninety-five

00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:41,430
percent accuracy and then it gets so

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,110
loved automatically and naturally if you

00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:45,870
want you can synchronize between devices

00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:48,600
as well and if you look at conversion

00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:50,790
rates only with autofill we've seen a 25

00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,980
princey percent increase in conversion

00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:55,950
which is great that's a lot of people

00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:58,110
and only just the small small tweaks not

00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:00,570
sort of all this terrible we need to

00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:02,520
build web for rato or something like

00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,200
that just you know we have a lot of good

00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:07,410
things just need to kind of tweak them

00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,390
and adapt into the users behaviors so

00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,760
weird autofill we sort of gone from

00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:13,830
manual and tedious to making things more

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,990
automatic and simple for users there's

00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:18,000
still kind of slow and still take a

00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:21,480
certain amount of tabs so we kind of

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,750
we're halfway there so imagine a world

00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,520
without forms it would be a beautiful

00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:29,630
world and it will probably never happen

00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:33,240
but it would be a beautiful world but

00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:36,120
what if it actually happens what if the

00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,700
new thing that's being worked on payment

00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,320
requests will take care of that so if

00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,150
you can go in somewhere and it's not

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,520
even a hint of a form you can just use

00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:47,310
your stored payment options pay for

00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:50,700
things and you're done which is amazing

00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:52,200
so it's just a simple JavaScript API and

00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,030
then the complicated parts are being

00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,850
taken care of in the different browsers

00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:58,440
and this is an open least I've developed

00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,550
API this is not a chrome specific thing

00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,850
there are a number of different

00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:05,220
companies working on this so it's

00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:07,860
currently under development and the w3c

00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,050
web payments working group and naturally

00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:14,790
of course it needs to work cross-browser

00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:16,740
this is not a one browser thing and of

00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:18,180
course you know not only chrome and

00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,740
especially Microsoft have been really

00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:22,100
good in this area and then helping out

00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:25,500
and building things and testing things

00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:27,060
our implementation has been on mobile

00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,790
first because you think it's much much

00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:31,110
harder on mobile than on desktop but

00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,610
then of course over time we want to be

00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:34,320
sure there is cross-platform so you have

00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:36,480
it on mobile you have on desktop you

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,610
basically have it everywhere and also

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,720
that we get an open ecosystem so we can

00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:44,750
support any counter payments out there

00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:47,370
so if you're adding on payment request

00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:50,220
we're making forms automatic and and

00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:52,080
simple and all kinds of payments we're

00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,480
also making them much faster you can

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,230
actually go to one tab checkouts which

00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:01,760
is fantastic right this is a revolution

00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:01,760
yes anyone

00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:13,340
yeah i don't care i'm going to buy a lot

00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:15,440
of with this and code wise is

00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:19,070
actually fairly simple so if you want to

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:22,489
implement this in the web page it kind

00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:24,710
of looks like this and the w3c is it has

00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:25,940
a first public working draft and this is

00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,950
the implementation that we have in

00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,419
chrome right now so it might change over

00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:32,690
time but it's probably going to be very

00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:34,279
similar to to this over time and the way

00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,989
to do it you have the first parameter so

00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:39,470
you have an array and you specify the

00:25:35,989 --> 00:25:41,119
different payment parameters or sort of

00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:42,440
the payment options you can have

00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:44,929
different credit cards in there for

00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,220
instance and then the browser uses the

00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:49,249
available meant to say you have stored

00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:51,440
in the browser and the default case is

00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:52,639
basically the only request a credit card

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,590
and the other things that you're seeing

00:25:52,639 --> 00:25:57,559
here are the line item is basically the

00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:59,330
things that you're buying so the cost

00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:01,580
for each twice and then finally you have

00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:05,359
a boolean what do you want to request an

00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:07,759
extra cost for shipping or not and the

00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,710
experience user experience for users

00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,539
then especially if you come in there and

00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:13,599
you have different payment options for

00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:15,830
instance you choose your payment option

00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,179
you might get a question about the

00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,249
shipping you choose what kind of

00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:21,470
shipping you want you process the

00:26:19,249 --> 00:26:23,570
payment and you're done that's it that's

00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:27,139
how easy it could be to buy things on

00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:29,570
the web and even beyond credit card I

00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:31,759
mean from google site last year we

00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:35,389
launched Android pay which has seen a

00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:37,519
really good uptake but of course that's

00:26:35,389 --> 00:26:40,399
been within Android app so naturally we

00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,749
need it on the web as well and in the

00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:44,059
way we see and reply it like it's an

00:26:41,749 --> 00:26:48,499
even more secure tokenized version of

00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:50,509
your card and code wise it's just the

00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:52,009
same thing as before so you have the

00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:53,869
different payment options you just keep

00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:56,659
on adding other ones be on credit cards

00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:58,909
you add android pay in there and then in

00:26:56,659 --> 00:27:01,159
this case android pay will require a few

00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:02,599
specific parameters and that's the

00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:04,639
important thing and because I mean

00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:06,139
android pay we sort of know those people

00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:08,239
so we work together and implement that

00:27:06,139 --> 00:27:10,369
but it should of course be only android

00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:12,440
pay it should be any kind of third-party

00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:14,869
payment provider that can offer this to

00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,590
users and the api should stay the same

00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:17,419
even if the

00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:20,270
payment options might require different

00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:22,820
parameters or details or something the

00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:26,090
core of it the entire skeleton should be

00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:28,549
the same so when can you start using

00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:32,270
this so we shipped it back in May behind

00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:35,450
a flag in Chrome we're now having it in

00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:38,059
chrome 53 on Android and we hope to be

00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:42,169
able to launch two stable chrome later

00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:44,090
this year and then in early 2017 we want

00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:45,919
to look sort of be on mobile and and get

00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:48,110
it onto more platforms and of course

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,299
working with other browser vendors and

00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:51,740
seeing their implementations and also

00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:54,830
having more third-party payment

00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:57,130
providers as well and again a few

00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:59,870
companies started working with this and

00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:02,990
bits and pieces are in production there

00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:04,789
as well and I think payments on the web

00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,770
is crucial like if we don't get payments

00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:08,480
right it's going to be really really bad

00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:10,909
people go through the pain for a while

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,750
but eventually we will lose out done a

00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:16,730
lot so please please try it out give us

00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,850
feedback give the other vendors feedback

00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:25,970
give w3c feedback because we need to get

00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:28,700
it right now for once so we're talking

00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:30,799
about making easier for users login make

00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:33,169
it easier for them to to pay for things

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:35,539
so I want to talk a bit about connecting

00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,770
to hardware and the web has already sort

00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:40,029
of had access to hardware with

00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:43,820
accelerometers and game controllers and

00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:45,770
camera audio input up with etc so the

00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:50,120
thing I wanted to mention more specific

00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:53,539
day is talking about web Bluetooth and

00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:55,789
not necessarily headsets and and trying

00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:57,470
to connect in meetings but more like

00:28:55,789 --> 00:28:58,970
heart rate sensors and similar like

00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:01,760
really small things that supports

00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:05,779
Bluetooth they can communicate with and

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:08,480
right now Bluetooth is at version 4 and

00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:11,750
it's generally referred to as ble or

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,700
Bluetooth Low Energy and if you look at

00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:17,149
the evolution of transfer rates over

00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:19,370
time with Wi-Fi it's increased lot with

00:29:17,149 --> 00:29:22,610
ethernet it's increased a lot with

00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:26,450
Bluetooth in version 3 we have 54 mega

00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:29,779
bits per second version 4 has 0.3 what

00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:34,139
the Firefox is going on there

00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:37,500
but actually it's pretty simple it comes

00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:39,059
down to power on cost the power

00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,889
consumption in these devices you want

00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:42,870
them to be able to live for as long as

00:29:40,889 --> 00:29:44,880
possible without needing any extra

00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:46,860
charging and the other part of course

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,289
just the cost of producing dice devices

00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,960
if we want a lot of devices out there we

00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:53,190
want to make sure that people can

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,990
companies can produce in so we have more

00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:58,049
of them so it doesn't just become a few

00:29:54,990 --> 00:30:00,240
of them that's really expensive and with

00:29:58,049 --> 00:30:02,940
web Bluetooth will connect connected

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,659
remote control race cars bluetooth low

00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:08,340
energy printers Spheeris bb-8 robot if

00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:11,820
you haven't played with that that's a

00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:14,340
lot of fun but also things like dotty

00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:17,909
which is a bluetooth LED notification

00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:24,960
display so I I thought I'd be brave and

00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:30,570
then try something here so this is a

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:37,320
Bluetooth candle this is a phone candle

00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:42,419
phone what I'll do is that I'll go into

00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:45,389
a web page a web page and I'll tap

00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:46,860
connect so it finds the candle here so

00:30:45,389 --> 00:30:48,860
it gives me an option so I can choose

00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,970
the candle and then I compared with it

00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:53,669
once I've paired with the candle like

00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:55,799
normal web page I can control the

00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:58,289
different effects on the candle what I

00:30:55,799 --> 00:31:00,570
wanted to show or you know which should

00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:03,120
be pulsating or you have the rainbow

00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:06,110
effect we've come a really long ways of

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,789
species haven't we this is fantastic and

00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:10,320
you know simply from within the web page

00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:12,179
it doesn't take much doesn't take much

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,870
code that's really easy to to connect

00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:23,240
and this is the candle you think I can

00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:23,240
blow it out pretty cool right

00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:31,090
yeah amazing physical skills like the

00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:35,860
shape I have to be in to blow out that

00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:37,660
candle and this demo is available on

00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,300
github so if you want to try something

00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:43,540
out there and just buy some kind of

00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:46,630
cheap loser device it is really easy to

00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:48,430
start experimenting and looking at this

00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,870
demo you have a few things you should

00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:51,910
know about you have the central device

00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:54,010
which is the phone you have the

00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:56,290
peripheral device which is the candle

00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:58,800
and then you have something called gap

00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:01,650
which is a generic attribute profile and

00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:04,330
basically the central device the phone

00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:07,090
interacts with the GATT server of the

00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:09,190
peripheral device the candle and then it

00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:11,410
asks what kind of services it supports

00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,480
so what you will get back for from the

00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:15,010
candle for instance are the services and

00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:19,780
characteristics that you can interact

00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:22,120
with and the code for that is something

00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:24,310
called navigated bluetooth to get a

00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:27,160
modal picker and it's really important

00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:29,470
to know that this calling bluetooth top

00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,390
request device again it needs to be

00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:34,090
within a secure contacts you need the

00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:35,740
ACPs for this but if you want to try

00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:38,470
something locally as well you can run it

00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,640
on localhost and try things out the

00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:42,220
other thing is that it needs to be

00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:44,560
called from a user interaction you can't

00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:46,690
just automatically connect people to any

00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:50,110
Bluetooth device out there will be fun

00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:51,760
for a while but you know so it needs the

00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:56,170
user interaction like a tap on a button

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:57,400
or something similar and also when you

00:32:56,170 --> 00:33:00,130
want to connect there and you see the

00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:02,170
request device method here the options

00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:04,540
parameter here is mandatory and

00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:06,700
officially just specify what kind of

00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:09,430
services you're looking for within

00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:11,260
Bluetooth devices near you because

00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,850
there's so much bluth of already

00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,350
outdoors instead of getting a list of

00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:15,790
hundreds and hundreds of devices really

00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:18,370
sure that I only want to connect to the

00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:21,610
ones but I can actually read or connect

00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:23,680
to the battery service here and once

00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:25,840
you're connected to the device you

00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:30,070
connect to the gas server of that device

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:32,410
and you're paired and then you connect

00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:34,870
the regattas you get the primary service

00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,770
which is the battery service and once

00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,630
you have that you

00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:39,940
the characteristic which is the battery

00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:42,280
level and then you use the read value

00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:44,290
method to get out any kind of value that

00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:46,480
you're looking for for instance here

00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:49,930
just the level of the battery put in

00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,790
something and vice versa you can write

00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:53,590
things to devices as well like with this

00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:56,710
candle and changing the colors in that

00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:58,810
you just connect to the candle you call

00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:01,150
the primary service to get the candle

00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:03,190
service you ready and then you connect a

00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:05,470
characteristic which is the candle

00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:09,550
cholera give you ID which is great and

00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:16,870
then you just use right value to change

00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:19,659
the color of the campbell and if you

00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:22,330
look at these values like candle service

00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:24,580
you ready etc they kind of seem magical

00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:29,679
like how do I actually know the names of

00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:32,020
the parameters on the device so most

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,360
Bluetooth devices come with a

00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:36,520
programming guide but if you don't have

00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:39,310
that one way you can do it I know people

00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,990
are excited about this me too one way

00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:43,480
you can do this is that you control

00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:45,399
sorry install control software on

00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,590
Android and then turn on the developer

00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:49,240
option in Android settings and that way

00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:51,310
you can capture all the Bluetooth

00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,810
packets and just read out the log and

00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:54,990
seeing what the different things are

00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:58,660
being named when you communicate with it

00:34:54,990 --> 00:35:01,660
and then finally you can also have event

00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:03,520
listeners so you have a certain value in

00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:06,190
this case with the candle and you can

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,200
see if that value is being changed so

00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:10,660
you have the characteristic value change

00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,070
and you see for instance the candle was

00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:17,170
being blown out then you can act

00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:20,710
accordingly to that I'll briefly also

00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:23,110
mentioned web NFC and basically just

00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:26,830
it's one of the specs being written on

00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:28,960
right now and basically using JSON to

00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:34,590
connect through over NFC with devices

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:38,530
and communicate and shout out to Kenneth

00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:40,360
is one of the two people working on that

00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:41,950
speck so you should definitely you

00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,270
should follow on Twitter and you should

00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:46,210
see the progress and you should ask him

00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:47,830
any questions this is by the way the

00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,120
best picture I could fly to him so you

00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,540
can imagine the ship that had to go

00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,270
through

00:35:49,540 --> 00:36:00,910
get here the web is a terrible place

00:35:52,270 --> 00:36:02,950
sometimes we also have generic sensors

00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:05,350
which is another speck that's being

00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:07,480
worked on you can have any kind of

00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:09,430
sensors on different kinds of devices so

00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:13,060
if you want to connect to a car and then

00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:15,490
you will see that the tire pressure on

00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:17,590
the rear left side of a car you could do

00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:19,540
that and then you have different events

00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:22,360
for instance that changing and things

00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:23,740
like that and same with your location

00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,140
you can have your leave view location

00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:28,030
sensor with a number of different event

00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:30,040
handlers and then interact with that so

00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:33,040
it's worth looking out and trying to get

00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,930
a more generic way from the web side of

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:38,890
interacting with any kind of sensors out

00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:40,660
there I'm talking about where Bluetooth

00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:43,840
it kind of leads me into the physical

00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:46,120
web and basically the physical web is

00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:49,870
about beacons they sort of look like

00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:54,160
this and the only thing they do in their

00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:55,840
existence kind of philosophical here but

00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,350
the only thing to do in the existence is

00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:02,350
that a broadcast a URL so they just sent

00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:04,150
out the URL and from the phone with

00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:06,940
bluetooth you can just see what's

00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:09,280
happening with that URL and it's also

00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:11,590
being based on how close you are to

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,930
something so if you have it on a train

00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:16,360
station this can broadcast a URL with

00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:18,100
the link just to the train schedule for

00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:21,040
instance or if you're parking your car

00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:22,900
you can stay in the car just see the URL

00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,140
from a beacon and then pay for your

00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:27,970
parking or you know shopping malls if

00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:29,320
you walk by a store in the broadcast

00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:31,620
that it has a sale today with thirty

00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:35,110
percent you know come in bye bye bye

00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:38,620
which is great so lots of small small

00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:40,030
things you can do with these and in the

00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:43,180
future we're also looking at something

00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:45,010
called referring device so instead of

00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:47,200
with the physical web beacons instead of

00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:50,260
just having the URL which is a good

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,930
start it's also you can connect to the

00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,760
GATT server of that device and then as

00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:56,470
you saw before same with the candle

00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,120
directly interface with beacons and

00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:01,870
other things like that with where

00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:03,170
Bluetooth as well so right now it's

00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:06,470
behind an experimental

00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:08,690
back in chrome and Chrome OS Chrome

00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:11,660
Android and Chrome for Linux we're also

00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:13,730
working on more stable versions in OS X

00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:16,040
and Windows and opera have also

00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:17,990
implemented this and we've seen a really

00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,910
big interest around grab Bluetooth we're

00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:24,109
hoping that more web browsers will get

00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:27,049
on board and start doing this as well it

00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:29,720
takes my own to web PR and Dominic was

00:38:27,049 --> 00:38:32,930
covering that just fine so i'll briefly

00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:34,760
just mention a few things and one

00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:39,500
interesting thing about version one the

00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:41,240
web view what we be sorry what VR API is

00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,920
that is landing in browsers like two

00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,660
three weeks ago it landed in Firefox

00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,670
nightly we're going to have it in chrome

00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,950
later this year and then just a few days

00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:51,470
ago microsoft also published a post that

00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:53,630
have begun development on web PR and

00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:56,030
also that all players are working

00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:58,069
together on specification what it should

00:38:56,030 --> 00:39:02,480
look like and to make sure that we get

00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:05,240
it right and at our big developer

00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,040
conference at Google i/o back in May we

00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,260
announce something called daydream and

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,690
basically they dream is two different

00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:13,700
things one is just a spec for what's

00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:16,400
required or mobile devices to be able to

00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:18,559
offer a good v your experience because

00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,930
basically if you want to be in a VR

00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:22,069
world and you don't get the good frame

00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:24,799
rates or something like that it's very

00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:29,030
very easy to feel sick which we don't

00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:30,680
want the other part is specifying what

00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:32,680
kind of experience the user should have

00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:35,270
so the minimum requirements to become

00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:38,299
daydream device for data you experience

00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:40,069
is one having enough good performance in

00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:43,579
the device the other one is making sure

00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:45,260
that we have headsets with a strap so

00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:47,930
with cord references the average user

00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:49,490
time is two minutes so naturally you

00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:52,069
need a strap to make sure that it lasts

00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:53,650
longer the other part is that they have

00:39:52,069 --> 00:39:56,480
to be shipped with the remote control

00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:58,099
something like this because we when

00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,630
you're in the VR world you don't want to

00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:01,549
touch the headset you don't want to have

00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,619
an xbox controller which would be like a

00:40:01,549 --> 00:40:05,690
spider in your hand like you want

00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:07,130
something that's really really simple so

00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:08,780
the festive occasion here for the remote

00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,849
is basically you have the remote you

00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,920
have one button to go home want to

00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:14,569
select things we also have motion

00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,000
controllers in its you get a certain

00:40:14,569 --> 00:40:19,520
sense of freedom and the top round

00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,140
Park there is a touchpad so you can move

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,700
your finger around you can use it as a

00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:25,100
gamepad or something like that if you

00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,120
want to and then of course you just put

00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:29,000
your phone in and you have that

00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:31,270
experience and this has been generally

00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,160
within more native experiments

00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:36,620
environments so far and a number of

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,240
experiments but of course like

00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:41,330
everything else we need to have this on

00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,590
the web and also the way we can spread

00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:45,050
it and make it available to as many

00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:47,930
people as possible would be through the

00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:49,790
web and it was mentioned before but one

00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:52,250
really good way to get started is the

00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:56,210
work by the muscle every our team with a

00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:58,940
frame just wrapping 3gs and WebGL in

00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:00,350
HTML custom elements and there you go so

00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:02,420
if you want to fill around with it

00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:04,730
without you know necessarily diamond too

00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:07,640
deep into how it actually works I really

00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:10,910
recommend that we also have one thing

00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:14,270
called VR view for the web so if you

00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:16,310
have a 360 photo or 360 video or

00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:19,280
something like that you can implement it

00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:21,110
directly within your web page and the

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,000
way it works like a few on a desktop

00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:24,590
computer for instance you get in there

00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,270
and you can click with the mouse and you

00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:30,710
can look around within the picture which

00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:32,600
is nice but if you have a VR headset of

00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:34,100
any kind you can just put the phone in

00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,560
there and then get the full immersive

00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:38,810
experience and I think this is great and

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,580
I think one really strong areas of the

00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:42,020
ER will have gaming a lots of

00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:45,620
interesting things there but it will be

00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:48,770
still for a long time one niche part of

00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:50,360
it I think more with this for getting

00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:53,810
people to experience places they might

00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:55,940
never ever be able to go to or if you're

00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:58,940
planning a trip somewhere you want to

00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:00,830
look what that island or country or

00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:03,470
hotel or something like that is about

00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:05,930
this really really nice date get a more

00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:09,200
proper experience with places in the

00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:13,910
world and an interesting part here as

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:18,460
well is that the co-founder and CEO

00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:18,460
oculus recently tweeted this as well

00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:26,760
which is great because at a really high

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,700
end you have HTC wives and you have

00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,680
oculus rift and you have a few other

00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:34,500
players but with him saying something

00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,960
like this the implementations sore

00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:41,369
implications what will happen with

00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:43,950
oculus as well are great right so with

00:42:41,369 --> 00:42:46,980
all of this and when I wanna stress is

00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:49,020
that any information that you have that

00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:51,690
can help us make the web better for you

00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:54,270
and easier for you to work with let us

00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:58,530
know for the chrome side you can report

00:42:54,270 --> 00:43:00,510
bugs at sea air bag calm we have chrome

00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:02,460
status calm just checking new platform

00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:05,700
features and status and also direct

00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:08,160
links for reporting bugs our team is on

00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,290
slack if you want to ask things or have

00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,230
a conversation and we also try and post

00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:15,119
all of our videos on youtube from talks

00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:17,609
and walkthroughs and things like that

00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:23,310
and naturally we're on twitter as well

00:43:17,609 --> 00:43:25,619
and what i want to end on is for a long

00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:28,710
time we sort of had the big five the big

00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:30,660
5 web browsers out there and what I

00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:32,280
really think we need to get away from is

00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:35,190
sort of any kind of bickering between

00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,290
web browser vendors or the fighting or

00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:40,920
taking sides I think they're really

00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:42,780
really important things is join up and

00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,670
working together on that and making the

00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:47,220
web as a whole better that's the only

00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:49,770
way to move forward the threat is not

00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:51,600
really between web browsers the threat

00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:54,240
is that the web will not be the first

00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:56,340
choice for developers and for users and

00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,369
we need to really make sure that because

00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:03,270
the web is really really really really

00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:05,640
important but also seeing the progress

00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:07,440
only the last few years is that you know

00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:09,450
only in the mobile world we have the

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,470
Android browsers for a while again I'm

00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:16,170
sorry but also you know opera mini and

00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:17,670
then on the right-hand side with safaris

00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:19,260
into the browser which is great and

00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:21,450
coming along great we have UC browser

00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:24,060
for instance so there's so many browsers

00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:25,980
out there so you need to make sure that

00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:28,710
things work in all of those things and

00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:31,260
we from the browser vendor side we're

00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:33,300
talking with all of these players

00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:35,910
wishing any kind of way that we can work

00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,530
together ingredient things and try and

00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:39,450
build the same things we shouldn't

00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:42,210
compete on the api's within the web

00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:43,800
platform I mean if we need to compete it

00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:45,780
could be speed or some web browser

00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,610
features but the web platform as a whole

00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:50,190
needs to be the same and we need to

00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:51,870
agree and work together on that the web

00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:53,790
is kind of a freak show but it's a

00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:56,640
