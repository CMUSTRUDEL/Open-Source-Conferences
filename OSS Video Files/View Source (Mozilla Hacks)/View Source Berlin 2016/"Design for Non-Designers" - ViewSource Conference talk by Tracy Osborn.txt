Title: "Design for Non-Designers" - ViewSource Conference talk by Tracy Osborn
Publication date: 2016-10-03
Playlist: View Source Berlin 2016
Description: 
	This talk will cover the top quick ways to improve your website, covering both user experience as well as visual design. Quick hits, easy to understand and utilize principles that anyone can use to improve their design skills. Perhaps you too can become the next designer+developer unicorn! 
Not everyone can hire a professional designer for their websites and web apps, but we all still want our interfaces to be easy to use and attractive. However, if you want to learn a bit of design, design books jump straight into concepts like "the golden ratio" and teach proper typographic terms which, to be frank, aren't needed if you're just looking to improve your website's look and feel.

 Tracy Osborn is a designer, developer, and entreprenerd living in the California Bay Area. Sheâ€™s a part of the developer relations team at DreamFactory, the author of Hello Web App, and creator of WeddingLovely. She's also an avid outdoorswoman and would love to go on a hike with you.

so we all work on the web and we're all

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,210
in like different little specialties I

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,070
started making this list and this is as

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,210
far as I got before I got really bored I

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,329
was like I'm not doing this anymore

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,220
and we all have her like I said a little

00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:25,070
our own little specialty you know we

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,290
were designers programmers engineers

00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:30,090
analysts etc but because we work on the

00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:33,570
web we can't just stay in our specialty

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:38,940
we have to move out to learn other other

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:40,410
things kind of like the optimum I've

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,870
been working for the last couple of

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,120
years specifically teaching people how

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,809
to program with my my book series hello

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,949
web app which is right up here and

00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:51,539
working on how to teach people who are

00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:53,579
not programmers they don't have it as a

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,679
background in programming how to teach

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,489
them how to program so I'm pretty proud

00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:02,309
of these books and while working on

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,980
these books I've been thinking a lot

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:06,540
about the other side of the spectrum how

00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:10,700
do you teach someone who is a designer

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:14,939
how to design and I mean design as in

00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:16,200
like becoming a designer but when you

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,930
work on work on the web and you're a

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,000
programmer a writer or salesperson or

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,600
marketer you're probably at some point

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,030
going to have to design something say

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,070
the homepage for the web app or excuse

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:33,710
me for the the project he just builds

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:35,850
Europe and source project your home page

00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,560
your home the front page of your home

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,469
page

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,840
you can't escape being it is doing some

00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:44,340
sort of design I don't want to have to

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,189
make every time you have to design

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,590
something hire someone to do design for

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,100
you and for the designers in the

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,840
audience

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,920
hopefully the tips I go over in this

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,810
presentation will also be helpful

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,640
because you know I I have a background

00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,829
design I have a BFA in graphic design

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,539
and constantly asked me people like how

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,829
do I become a better designer so

00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:04,229
hopefully these tips will help you

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:06,210
figure out some shortcuts and some

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,289
principles for teaching people how to

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,880
become a little bit better at design

00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:12,900
design is a kind of intimidating like

00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,880
looking at this there's so many

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,810
different fields within design and when

00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,520
someone says I want to become a designer

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,160
it could be like oh you mean

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,300
hexxus I knew I design visual design

00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,630
some design etc I'm like what do you

00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,900
mean by becoming a designer in this

00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:31,640
presentation I just want to go over how

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:34,890
do we care to create more effective

00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,140
basic designs just getting someone from

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,030
zero to one making them more comfortable

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:44,790
starting out doing the sign for

00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:47,130
themselves so first and foremost let's

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,140
talk about clutter when someone comes to

00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,270
me and says hey can I become how do I

00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,330
become a better designer they're usually

00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:56,580
asking not about you user experience

00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,350
which we'll get into in a second but

00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,040
more how can I make my designs look

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:05,190
better and look more professional more

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,100
clean so clutter is going to be the

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:14,610
number one thing I want you to remember

00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:16,440
for example so the fastest way to become

00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,910
a better designer just to think about

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,490
clutter and think about ways that you

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,350
can reduce clutter I built this little

00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,000
widget and we're gonna go over some

00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,950
design principles and how they applied

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,540
this widget to cut down on clutter and

00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:31,230
make this little widget look a little

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:34,170
bit nicer so to start out with let's

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,810
talk about the grid the grid and its

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:39,740
basic basic core is just simply lining

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,580
things up because pixel differences or

00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:44,700
unconsciously or even consciously

00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,959
noticed there's a story by the designer

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,300
who works with the developer and

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,100
designer builds that pixel perfect

00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,959
composition hands it over to the

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,459
developer and the developer built it and

00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,920
then the designer comes away and goes

00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,959
hey this is two pixels off and the

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,120
developers like it is two pixels matter

00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,620
and this story is usually told as a way

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,350
like saying oh look at these designers

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,760
are totally crazy but the little pixel

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:09,990
differences can make a difference and

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,180
I'm a huge fan of shortcuts

00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:14,310
it drives me absolutely nutty every time

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,959
I see these posts like blog post a

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,970
medium post saying and he stopped

00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,100
relying on frameworks we need to teach

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,570
people how to design from scratch but

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,820
for someone who's just starting out with

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,930
a design just trying to get their

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,060
homepage design up

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,530
I love bootstrap because you know it has

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,689
all these things including included a

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,009
grid to help you just

00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:35,729
essentially line things up and make

00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:38,309
things look a little more clean so for

00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:41,279
our little widget here we're just gonna

00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:42,749
line up the edges kind of vertically

00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:47,299
align everything and you can already

00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:47,299
tell that's looking a little bit cleaner

00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:53,159
next principle of color so these are the

00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:56,549
big overarching principles and color is

00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:58,799
a huge subject I did a whole whole

00:04:56,549 --> 00:05:02,759
quarter in college on color theory and

00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:04,860
dear God I never want it again I learned

00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,689
a lot and a lot of the things like the

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,829
basic principles to remember is

00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:10,439
essentially to keep your colors

00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:13,259
complimentary not gets that a second and

00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:16,229
use mostly neutrals and one brighter

00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:18,419
color for important things all these

00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:20,009
principles that I'm gonna go over they

00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,569
can be you know you can always break

00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:23,519
these rules later especially you want to

00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:24,839
get more skill I like to give principles

00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,279
in the beginning just like little

00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:31,409
guidelines to remember for new designers

00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:33,419
so if you're looking for a more complete

00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:35,909
resource about color I particularly like

00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:37,800
this this article here the simple web

00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:40,110
developers guide the color by Smashing

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,819
Magazine and it goes over too much what

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,829
it means by complementary colors and

00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:48,599
good principles and things understand in

00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:49,919
this one article but I also again I'm a

00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:52,169
big fan of short cuts and this is my

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,899
absolute favorite shortcut when it comes

00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:57,509
to color color lovers it's a place where

00:05:54,899 --> 00:06:00,599
you can submit color palettes and then

00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:03,959
have the community vote on them and you

00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:06,689
can search by all palettes like most

00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:09,029
loved palettes of all time and here and

00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:11,369
get gets color palettes that already are

00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:12,839
guaranteed to be complementary that work

00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:14,519
well together you have a lot of

00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,379
different options that go from rather

00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:19,559
than say starting a color palette from

00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:21,599
scratch this is where I got the design

00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:22,860
for my book series hello web app it's

00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:25,169
where I got the design for my start up

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,689
wedding lovely like I am the trained and

00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:30,629
color theory but I will never ever do it

00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:32,939
it's much I don't know it's too much for

00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:36,149
even me and I like to use the shortcut

00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:37,829
of color levers so when you go back to

00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:40,240
your widget you can go to color lovers

00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:41,590
find palettes that you like and

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,650
applying them and some of them might not

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:47,830
work out you can start trying different

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:49,419
things and seeing if you know something

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:51,699
works better than the other and find

00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:53,740
something that you like it's a great

00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:58,539
shortcut for choosing colors for your

00:06:53,740 --> 00:07:01,180
whatever you're designing the next

00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:03,310
principle is fonts again the principles

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,190
of this is to keep the number of fonts

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:09,789
low a good rule of thumb is to use two

00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:11,949
different fonts use fancy or display

00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:13,599
fonts fonts Ferenc experiment and by

00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:15,220
that I mean these ones I have in the

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,550
background they're very cluttery

00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:21,190
they're not very clean and if you need

00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:24,220
to add more differentiation you can vary

00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:26,139
weights and style and transforms and use

00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:32,380
that different differentiate parts of

00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:33,729
your website but again for shortcuts so

00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,500
say if you went into google fonts and

00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:37,389
you're looking through I think all 200

00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,360
maybe more different fonts that they

00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:42,120
have and it's very overwhelming I like

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,289
to go places like beautiful web type

00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,729
type wolf there's a lot of different

00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:48,759
collections on there it says hey instead

00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:51,759
of 200 web fonts they say here the best

00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:54,849
20 so having these little shortcuts

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,680
having curated fonts will make it easier

00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,449
for you to kite look through make a

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,190
smaller set and make it easier for you

00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:03,550
to find the best fonts for whatever

00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:06,669
you're designing step back to this

00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:09,219
little widget I'm going to update the

00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:12,430
fonts we're gonna use use 2:1 serif

00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:14,469
fonts ansara we have some different

00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,039
styling there's X holux and lowercase in

00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:17,289
the form

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,699
there's uppercase tracked out a little

00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:21,340
bit on the button but these are

00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:25,990
essentially two different fonts and

00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:29,440
certainly look a little better last but

00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:31,870
not least white space white space is the

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,909
ultimate ultimate clutter reducer I

00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:36,729
always laugh because I go on to hacker

00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:38,860
news / much daily and every six months

00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:41,829
or so if someone comes along says hey

00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,659
guys I I updated our I created new

00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:46,839
design for hacker news I redesigned

00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:49,270
hacker news and every single time these

00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,220
designs they immediately open it up they

00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,550
add more white space they make things a

00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,930
little bit less buttery

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,040
like it's it's now a game with me

00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:59,180
whenever I see that I'm like white space

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:01,070
white space for a more subtle example

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,630
sometimes you can't really add buckets

00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,540
white space but this is the redesign of

00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:07,640
New York Times website they have a lot

00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,280
of content and it's really hard to make

00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,070
this content look clean because there's

00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,830
so much there but the before is on the

00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:17,630
left me after is on the right and one of

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,310
the biggest things they did to improve

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,050
their design which was added a little

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,300
bit more spacing and columns between the

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:26,210
text by just adding a little bit more

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:30,770
space may the right look a little bit

00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:33,050
cleaner than the left right space is

00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,760
also a huge trend right now I went onto

00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,080
one of those like top CSS design

00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,120
websites and I grabbed the random

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,700
screenshot and every single one of these

00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,670
is like acres a white space so yeah the

00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,410
trends are working on your side the

00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,300
white space also can improve your

00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:50,390
conversion rates white space can make it

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:52,220
easier for your users to find what they

00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,990
need to do and like do what you want

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:57,830
them to do like fill out a form or buy a

00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:59,300
product so in this example simply by

00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,430
adding more white space in between the

00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,130
tables the left you can see there's some

00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:06,590
links 13th the button the right that a

00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,540
space is opened up and that led to an

00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:11,180
increase in conversion led to increase

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,130
in products add the come to cart and it

00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:15,770
led to increase and customers continuing

00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:18,500
through to purchase so white space

00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:20,510
reduces clutter it's very trendy it

00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:24,380
looks very modern right now but it also

00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:25,130
can improve your buying online back to

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,830
the widget

00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:32,540
we're gonna add some more space and it

00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:33,980
looks even more clean so remember when

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,350
you're when you're working on the

00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,730
visuals apart the number one thing to

00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,260
remember is the reduce visual clutter

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,480
and you can do that by keeping the

00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,790
number of fonts and colors low adding

00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:47,860
white space and lining things up aiming

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:47,860
for a clean design will get you so far

00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,450
but user experience user experience and

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,850
how vehicle use what you're building is

00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:58,610
also very important so one thing to

00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,990
remember always look for what the action

00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,030
is in your design what you want people

00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,550
to do and make sure that action is easy

00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,550
to find

00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:07,769
use that's why the buttons in our little

00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,000
form here are bright orange it makes it

00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:10,860
easier for someone let's say okay this

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,330
is what I need to click on this is why I

00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,690
need to do rather than say hiding that

00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:17,880
button and that's why landing pages have

00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,310
big bright buttons on their homepage

00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,769
like mine or this one where the

00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:25,500
background is fairly neutral not bright

00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:28,019
blue button it doesn't just have to be

00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,000
landing pages and big banners they can

00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:31,320
also compete you say a widget and the

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,649
bottom says hey if you're interested in

00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,839
a job click here making things that you

00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:39,540
only want when you want someone to

00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:44,430
complete an action making sure make sure

00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:46,200
that it's easy to find and use when

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,970
you're working on a new design make sure

00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,410
you're just relying on yourself make

00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,269
sure you're getting into like a second

00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,370
or third or fourth opinion on your

00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:56,459
designs either with your future self

00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:58,350
take a step back you know go to sleep

00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:01,140
look at your design the next morning and

00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:03,690
kind of reevaluate it with new eyes or

00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,920
run your design by others and see you

00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:07,290
know what problems need right where I'm

00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,700
into it's kind of hard to accept

00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,680
criticism from others but it's very

00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,329
important when it come to design because

00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,920
those people will help you figure out if

00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:19,230
your design is working well then quickly

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,720
into content because this is a big area

00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:25,470
of a lot of people missed content is

00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,910
also can be very cluttered and a good

00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,390
rule of thumb for content is that less

00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,610
is more

00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:32,190
the shorter you can write the shorter

00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:33,690
your paragraphs can be the easier it is

00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:36,540
for someone to read such a gets people

00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:38,700
on the web skin if you can't cut down

00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:42,810
your content break into bullets when you

00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:44,850
can so for example the the paragraph on

00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:47,310
the left here is kind of one big block

00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,959
of content you can read it but you'd

00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,550
have to go line by line it's not great

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,750
it's pretty difficult and if you're a

00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:54,510
skinny iMac lab you're probably just

00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:56,100
just skip it you make it easier to read

00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:59,610
by breaking it to bullets

00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:03,540
giving the eye a place to land as they

00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:05,070
go through that paragraph you can

00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,930
further improve readability by adding

00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:09,029
some that bolding we talked about by

00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:11,399
bolding the important parts of these

00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:13,350
paragraphs making it even easier for

00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,200
someone to skim see what that paragraph

00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,839
is about

00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,000
and then read further and you can

00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:23,769
further improve the readability bad news

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,899
is facing as we talked about for a real

00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:28,600
life example my friends website read the

00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:32,410
docs and I was on here the other day and

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,690
I noticed that the hover on the forum

00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:37,060
there's a bright green hover this is

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,589
what the website looks naturally and if

00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,690
he came to me and said hey Tracey how

00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:42,160
would you improve my homepage how would

00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,050
you make it easier to use this is

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,160
something I would test you know you can

00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,050
you don't have to just implement

00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,269
something you can just test it out and

00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,800
see if something works because this

00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:51,910
version of the website doesn't really

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,490
direct to you what you need to do

00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:55,959
everything is pretty gray in your area

00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,240
has this hover element and we just

00:13:55,959 --> 00:14:00,190
talked about making sure the action of

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,670
your pages should be easy to find and

00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:08,170
use we also just talked about content

00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:10,839
and we could do is take that beautiful

00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:12,660
paragraph this looks really nice and

00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:14,769
this technically isn't as nice looking

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,779
but this is something I would test I

00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:18,790
would test whether this paragraph is

00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:21,250
more easily understood if it's broken up

00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:23,470
into bullets if there was some strategic

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,470
bolding that was added if that headline

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,810
which it says what is this place if that

00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,070
headline answered that question rather

00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,660
than asking the question that someone

00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,970
might already have in their brand in

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,320
their mind so this is a lot of things I

00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,089
would test in this real live website

00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:41,680
using those principles that we just went

00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:43,529
over and quickly into headlines because

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,149
it's in their area that's often missed

00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:48,790
when it comes to headlines try to talk

00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:50,680
benefits not details talk about what

00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:52,300
it's going to do for the person reading

00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,820
your content or reading your webpage

00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,819
rather than what's going to do for them

00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:00,180
rather than what it does and headlines

00:14:57,819 --> 00:15:02,529
also benefit from keeping it short

00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:06,040
keeping something this short sweet easy

00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:07,959
to read and if possible write like a

00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,029
human not a robot try to sound more

00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:11,139
friendly sound a little bit more like

00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:15,180
you're having a conversation with

00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:17,620
someone rather than just stating facts

00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,970
for example this is technically what my

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,160
books are about my books are an

00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:23,079
introduction to building web apps using

00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,400
Python and Django but this is boring

00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:27,340
this is long no one wants to

00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,320
rebus this is actually what my books are

00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:31,840
about this is what it does for the

00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,060
person coming to hi website this is more

00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,980
exciting so it's a little bit into

00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,350
marketing but as well as kind of things

00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,210
to remember that the headlines of your

00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:44,110
websites or your web apps or your forms

00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:48,100
are as important as the design and how

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:49,300
it works and these kind of things can

00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:53,740
affect your bottom line as well

00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:55,690
this this test changed the headline from

00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,520
talking about what it does to what it's

00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:02,280
gonna do for the person reading it and

00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,280
then improve their conversion by 52.8%

00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:07,990
so we're back here we're not done yet we

00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,340
just went over content over headlines

00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,990
you might notice that this is kind of

00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,140
long content the headline is kind of

00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:15,790
boring and we can update both of those

00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:17,590
we can make that headline a little bit

00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:19,530
more fun a little bit more about what

00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:22,530
the person is there you know hopefully

00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:25,570
excite the person reading the headline I

00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:27,400
think some bolding and the content we

00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:29,290
changed the form rather than just saying

00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,630
email address a little bit more friendly

00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:34,180
we say add your email here and change

00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:39,130
the button from just simple download to

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:41,830
send very free info so in each of these

00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:46,180
little things we've learned we've gone

00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:48,210
from here to here hopefully that helps

00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:53,130
illustrate how lots of like little

00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:53,130
improvements can help something overall

00:16:53,520 --> 00:17:01,330
all right a little bit into theory so if

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,920
you're sitting down and you know you say

00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,510
I'm gonna design this you Paul your

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,430
piece of paper you know put it on your

00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,959
desk wipe everything else out it sit

00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,790
down with a pen and you're just gonna

00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:12,870
start sketching and figuring ideas

00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:15,490
without anything around you that's a lot

00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:18,970
like trying to program without the use

00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:20,320
of Stack Overflow it's like shooting

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:23,740
yourself in the foot it's giving

00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:27,760
yourself a handicap no one really

00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:29,830
designs from scratch my books wouldn't

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,470
look like I'm not gonna say I'm like the

00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:35,020
best most amazing cover designer in the

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,890
world but my book looks so much better

00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,390
because I had

00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,220
wonderful a book apart books as

00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,500
inspiration I was able to look at those

00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,930
books see the cover quality see the

00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,570
paper quality see their size the length

00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:48,910
of the books and because they're so

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:53,110
amazing I use them for inspiration and

00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:54,730
my book was better for it when it comes

00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:57,070
to design there's lots of places on your

00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:00,040
net that showcase great design they can

00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:03,850
go and see and look for inspiration like

00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:07,090
sight inspire I'm match style.css mania

00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:09,700
you can go on here and see you know find

00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:12,010
websites or designs that relate to what

00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,720
you're trying to do yourself and look at

00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,970
what they're doing well and try to pick

00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:20,140
that out use it for inspiration I don't

00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:21,850
steal but it's you know use it for

00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,440
inspiration highly highly encouraged to

00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:27,070
do so and that's what everyone all the

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,410
designers do so when you find something

00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:31,630
that works well like this really nice

00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:34,900
flat homepage start training your design

00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:37,690
I look at the design and trying to pick

00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:40,270
out what it's doing well so you might

00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:42,070
say here like okay the form has a stark

00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:44,530
background behind it which adds more

00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,870
contrast which makes it easier you know

00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:48,280
for the eye to point over to it the

00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:50,560
button is green which makes us stand out

00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,790
from the rest of the background there is

00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,890
a little squigglies underneath the

00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:55,660
headlines if you know looks a little bit

00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,670
like hand-drawn which is something you

00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,200
don't really see in the designs which

00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:02,410
also the catches eye makes it looks more

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,540
interesting they have bolding on NASA's

00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:06,760
Jet Propulsion Laboratory and slack and

00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:10,560
free so someone can decide a clancy's

00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:13,240
NASA slack free all the important words

00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:16,660
now on the top right here's the creative

00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,860
team has a has a border around it like

00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,320
there's all these little things that

00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,940
slack homepage is doing and if you find

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,130
a sign that works well or your

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,480
competitor go through it and try to pick

00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,730
out what it's doing well it's gonna help

00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,300
train your design eye and make it easier

00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:34,290
for you to you know regurgitate those

00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:36,640
design ideas into your own designs later

00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:38,380
it's kind of a meme you know great

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,600
artists copy great artists in a good

00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:43,600
artists copy great oh steel I polished

00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,310
Casso and then Bansky comes along and

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,830
says the bad armas imitates the great

00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,610
artists steal there's whole long books

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:51,910
about this con

00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:54,130
that don't think you have to design from

00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:58,390
scratch use inspiration as much as

00:19:54,130 --> 00:20:00,299
possible all right last but not least a

00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:05,230
quick overview of a design process

00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:06,670
especially as it works for me so you're

00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,260
sitting down working on a new design

00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:11,470
number one we just talked about

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:14,080
collecting inspiration and sketching

00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:15,400
some ideas start sketching the ideas

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,460
that you get as you look at other web

00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,049
pages sketching out the ideas that you

00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,840
you pick up the good things that web

00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:25,360
pages are doing this is specifically how

00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,390
I do it I have a feedly I have a whole

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,980
on category for designs when I work on

00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,929
something on a new design I go through

00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,490
here and I tab through seeing lots of

00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:36,160
things at a glance I can open things up

00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:40,919
a new tab and kind of pick through it as

00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:42,700
needed now when it comes to to sketching

00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:47,410
sketches don't look like this this

00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:49,120
person is showing off don't worry about

00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:51,460
like pixel perfect beautiful sketches

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,809
these are actually my sketches from my

00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,690
recent redesign for the hill web app

00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:58,360
website and it's just boxes and lines

00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:01,210
and just little notes to help me

00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,929
remember what I need to what like the

00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:06,429
ideas I was generating for this layout

00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:08,080
this really really simple your

00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:12,400
discussions do not have to look really

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,570
that awesome and then the next thing is

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,040
a lot of people talk to me is like I do

00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:19,600
go straight from sketches and ideas the

00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,610
you go straight as a code or you mock it

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,460
up and I'm a huge fan of mocking things

00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:27,040
up because when you're testing out

00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:28,929
layout ideas or testing out how things

00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,179
are gonna work it's much easier to move

00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:34,299
elements in a mock-up than it is to do

00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:35,650
when you're in code in my opinion and

00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:37,960
again your mock-ups don't have to be

00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:39,400
pixel perfect I use sketch for my

00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,370
mock-up speaking you something like

00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,169
and this is just for me to figure out

00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:46,990
how the layout of this website is going

00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:48,370
to work now instead of having help me

00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,750
figure out that instead of having a

00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,490
paragraph at the top I wanted to have a

00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,679
bulleted list I wanted to have it

00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:55,870
generally one column with two elements

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,130
off to the side this is not the

00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,140
background color it's gonna be it's not

00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,220
the fonts it's gonna be it's not the

00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,889
imagery

00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:05,289
but be able to mock this up just really

00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:07,720
really simply helped me a lot for

00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:09,879
building this design you know and

00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,210
sometimes I do full-on like pitch the

00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:17,139
perfect beautiful designs but really

00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:20,200
most of time something like this and

00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:25,649
then build it which yeah we all know

00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:28,659
that so a little bit of reassurance

00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:30,399
every single time to this day every

00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:32,320
single time I sit down and work on a new

00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:37,570
design this is what goes on through my

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,710
head it never goes well I always sit

00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,720
down I'm like oh my gosh I have a

00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,730
horrible designer what happened I forget

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,830
everything I ever learned this is

00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:46,509
terrible what am i doing like intense

00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,710
amounts of impasto syndrome and

00:22:46,509 --> 00:22:51,159
sometimes it's not even like yes

00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:53,889
sometimes is like ah maybe maybe this is

00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:57,009
working so if you're sitting down

00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:59,080
working on a new design and you're

00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:00,580
hating it and nothing's working out and

00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,379
you think to yourself I'm such a

00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:05,559
terrible designer I hate design I can

00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:08,350
never become a designer you're not a bad

00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:13,269
designer you simply are a designer this

00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:15,399
is the process I go it through it too so

00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:17,049
this is only the starting point I hope

00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:18,519
in this 20 minutes I gave you little

00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:20,649
pieces of knowledge to help you become

00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:23,350
you know more confidence with doing your

00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:25,600
own design remember when it comes to

00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:28,389
visual design reduce visual clutter

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,580
number one now and do that by keeping a

00:23:28,389 --> 00:23:32,889
number of fonts and colors low adding

00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:36,429
white space lining things up keeping

00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:39,190
your content short and easy to skim make

00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:43,240
sure that your goal is easy to find the

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:44,820
muse keep your content simple friendly

00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,179
into the point

00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:50,379
and above all practice practice practice

00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:51,970
because you can't become a better

00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:54,879
designer all think you know just by

00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:56,049
reading about it you have to do it you

00:23:54,879 --> 00:23:59,769
have to work on it and it will get

00:23:56,049 --> 00:24:02,350
better over time this is gonna be the

00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:04,240
topic of my third book if you are

00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,100
