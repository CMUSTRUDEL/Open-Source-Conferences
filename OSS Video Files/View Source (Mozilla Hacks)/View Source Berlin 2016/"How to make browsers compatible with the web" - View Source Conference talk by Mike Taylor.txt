Title: "How to make browsers compatible with the web" - View Source Conference talk by Mike Taylor
Publication date: 2016-10-03
Playlist: View Source Berlin 2016
Description: 
	What does it mean for JavaScript and CSS to be — or not to be — compatible with the web?

Is it possible for a site written today to continue to work in 10 years? Likewise, could existing code complicate adding language features or fixing mistakes in web APIs?

In this talk I'll discuss the issues that arise when browsers attempt to clean up the web platform, either by adding new language features and DOM APIs or removing old ones — while attempting to remain backwards compatible. I'll even talk about some controversial moves made by browsers to support non-standard (cough webkit prefixes) CSS and JS.

	00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,400
said I'm going to be talking about a

00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,630
topic that's kind of weird for

00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,460
developers it's it's what we do as

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,940
make the web work could continue to work

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:22,800
for people so the 30 second intro into

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:26,220
me I'm Mike I live in Texas and that's

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,829
really all you need to know I worked for

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,500
Mozilla I asked potch if it would be

00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:36,239
appropriate to resign on stage he said

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:39,050
no so that's not going to happen that

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,300
was to make everyone feel uncomfortable

00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:44,040
so I hooked everyone up with a discount

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:49,260
code you can download Firefox for the

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,820
next one hour for free we're not

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,290
streaming this to Mountain View are we

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:57,390
it's that anyhow so so so what is web

00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,520
compatibility and why is it important so

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,870
I've been trying to certain people when

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,760
you hear that term web compatibility

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,170
you're like what does that even mean you

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,210
know as developers we talk about

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,159
cross-browser compatibility but

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,799
sometimes browser vendors talk about web

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,640
compatibility and I'm trying to come up

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,619
with this metaphor that I i'm not sure

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,259
if it works but we'll see so if you if

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:26,880
you have something that's like so

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:28,439
important so good like juice right you

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,009
want to share that with everyone right

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:35,670
everyone deserves juice this is a

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:39,149
terrible metaphor I immediately regret

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,829
thinking of that if I had photoshop this

00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:43,409
would have been a bottle of club monta

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:48,929
but I don't have a license for photoshop

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:53,240
and torrenting is impolite so web juice

00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:53,240
right everyone deserves web juice

00:01:53,450 --> 00:02:00,770
like even this little weird kid deserves

00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:02,819
the web juice okay we're done with that

00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:05,369
sometimes though like even though the

00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,829
web is so important right it's access

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:11,640
should be universal information is for

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:16,549
everyone sometimes we get different

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:18,660
experiences depending on your user agent

00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:21,959
for for reasons that are hard to

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,480
comprehend so we're in Germany but I

00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,630
assume you can all speak Spanish so for

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,829
whatever reason in Florida there's a

00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:32,549
singular path but it takes one minute

00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:35,310
longer if you speak Spanish so that

00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:38,910
happens on the web too which is slightly

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:42,420
more startling last year this this image

00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:44,760
on the left if you were to visit this

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,410
really popular website in Japan in

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,819
Firefox for Android that's what you saw

00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,099
right and so your immediate reaction

00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:54,150
would be to like throw away your mobile

00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:55,920
phone and buy an iPhone not everyone can

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,450
do that and so what what you were

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,459
supposed to see is this image on the

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:04,260
right right if you had like a apple

00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:05,880
iphone it would look great and and

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,859
that's not just a week we can't say like

00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,319
oh that only happens in Asia right so

00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:12,620
okcupid which is my favorite social

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,620
network

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:21,130
should like hide my wedding ring now

00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:22,660
sorry mom this also happens right like

00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:26,620
this happens everywhere and if you had

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:29,650
to guess like what's going on we'll

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,720
figure that out in a minute so really

00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,270
web compatibility is like being a

00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,780
garbage man a plumber like it's really

00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:39,610
just looking at a lot of nasty stuff and

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,740
as browser vendors we have to figure out

00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,800
like okay what's the nasty stuff that

00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:47,320
the web depends on and how do we put

00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,920
that into our product and everyone does

00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,970
this so the next couple of minutes we're

00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,650
going to just kind of look at some

00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:59,380
examples of nasty stuff and it's totally

00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,630
code of conduct friendly I promise and

00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:04,660
we're going to just this is like a group

00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:06,880
therapy session and and we're just going

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:11,890
to do that so raise your hand if you're

00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:15,750
intimate with jas prototypes for the

00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:18,820
stream nobody raised their hand right so

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:22,930
prototypes are super simple and okay

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:26,110
everyone understands them so how do I

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:28,419
mean some of us how it works is you have

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,100
like objects that inherit for other

00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:32,500
objects and they have this magical link

00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:36,040
between properties and if you fiddle

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:40,150
with the top guy the bottom guy or girl

00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:44,830
is suddenly different as well and that's

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:46,690
what this document says so here's an

00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,790
example of how you can break the web by

00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:51,250
messing with prototypes so a really

00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,530
popular JavaScript library a few years

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:59,500
back was called mootools round of

00:04:53,530 --> 00:05:01,930
applause from nobody okay they had this

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,370
method called contains this is the

00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,630
Mutual's version right and their method

00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:10,990
signature was search string separator

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:13,720
and there's a typo in the word separator

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,400
I apologize just notice that so how that

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,960
worked is you would say ABC do you

00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,669
contain this and if for whatever reason

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,640
you wanted to separate that with with an

00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:23,710
empty string you could do that es6 added

00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,440
also a string prototype contains method

00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,300
and

00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,460
the method signature was different i

00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,550
guess nobody on the mood tools core team

00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:35,000
is in tc39 and so no one actually

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,070
realized this and it's you'll notice the

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,330
second argument is positioned so you

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,730
don't even really understand that you

00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:45,620
just no one expects a string one accepts

00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:47,660
a number will say so so what do you

00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,030
think happens when you implement support

00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:53,180
for the the new version of es6 string

00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:55,040
prototype contains right the internet

00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,030
blows up we actually we ship this in

00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:01,310
Firefox nightly and a german bank broke

00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:03,710
and so if you ship a browser you can't

00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:05,870
be in the business of breaking banks so

00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:08,060
immediately like within a day we back

00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:11,810
that code out like we can't break the

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:18,380
web because web juice is really

00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:20,930
important remember that yep so sometimes

00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,420
when we evolve the web platform we end

00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,890
up breaking code that is violating our

00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,200
assumptions and so we need to change

00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:29,030
those assumptions the solution to this

00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,590
was actually just to i deleted the slide

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:35,419
on accident was to rename this and so

00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:38,090
now if you look up on mdn it's actually

00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:40,790
called string prototype includes that's

00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:43,580
that's the wrong slide so so the

00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:45,590
solution there is like a super lame

00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:49,010
solution it's like let's just rename the

00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:50,150
broken thing and it worked and so so now

00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,790
that's shipping like in all browsers

00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,860
string prototype includes so here's

00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:57,980
here's another example of where things

00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:00,350
can go wrong so imagine you're you're

00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:03,100
trying to visit this amazing website

00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:06,350
about sushi restaurants in New York City

00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:09,040
and it says like oh we don't support

00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,040
your orientation

00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:19,539
offensive I know just just rotate your

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,569
phone right has anyone ever seen a

00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:27,509
website like this has anyone ever done

00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:29,680
this but sure ok we're going to talk

00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:34,599
you're like whatever I can rotate my

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,910
phone right and it's like it doesn't

00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:38,530
know that you rotated your phone and so

00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,419
that was an interesting bug and it turns

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:43,300
out the reason why is there's this this

00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:44,860
API called window orientation and here's

00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,680
here's this code right so if you're an

00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:50,590
iPhone or an Android everybody has one

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,910
of those listen for this orientation

00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:55,349
event and let's look at window

00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:59,080
orientation if it's if it's not zero

00:07:55,349 --> 00:08:01,090
called a bad orientation method that's

00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:05,759
actually their code that's their name

00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,759
bad orientation like super judgmental

00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:12,249
ok so if window orientation is not equal

00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:15,059
to 0 so you're thinking okay what is the

00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:20,139
value of a Dom property that's not there

00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:23,649
like oh it's undefined right so I think

00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:26,919
we have 3d glasses under your seats did

00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:30,069
we know a backstage is saying we okay

00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:32,409
will do this in 2d so it access your

00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:33,849
internal JavaScript parsers undefined

00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:38,709
it's not equal zero is that true or

00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:41,379
false one person with confidence said

00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:43,719
true right no one remembers like open up

00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:44,829
devtools it's it's actually true and so

00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,439
you're always going to call bad

00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:52,509
orientation so no matter what undefined

00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:56,350
it's not equal zero right okay take a

00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:57,490
deep breath and the reason why so so

00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:02,470
window orientation does anyone remember

00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:07,600
what spec this is in you don't because I

00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:09,459
wrote the spec Apple invented the window

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,350
orientation API because it was really

00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:13,660
cool and useful and they were so busy

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:20,140
they forgot to write a spec for it and

00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:24,620
websites they have a lot going on

00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:26,839
websites began to depend on this and

00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,420
they started to break so as as someone

00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,890
who helps work on a browser it's

00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,420
important to me that that works and so

00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,040
we reverse engineered this we

00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,200
implemented in gecko and now it works

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,690
and we wrote a spec and I'll talk about

00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,220
that in a minute and an edge did the

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,529
same thing and so now this is basically

00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:46,850
part of the web platform you're welcome

00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:50,600
Apple and I guess let's make this full

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:52,460
screen that'll be nicer so we're gonna

00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,170
we're going to hop into let's let's go

00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,150
back to quiz mode so we would we just

00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:58,490
saw some javascript stuff some Dom stuff

00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:03,650
and now we're going to look at the CSS

00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:06,710
um my favorite object model okay so so

00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:08,570
this is a quiz super interactive so as

00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:12,290
of today like in nightly versions of all

00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:14,120
these browsers which one of these works

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:16,490
across the board like what's the cross

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,589
browser way so we've got WebKit

00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:23,839
transform other WebKit transform dash

00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:25,339
whippet transform or just transform so

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,060
think about that raise your hand if you

00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:35,000
think it's one okay if you think it's

00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:37,190
too okay if you think it's three what

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,890
what okay

00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:41,270
if you think it's for all right like

00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,220
that one's like obvious right like that

00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:48,380
that one actually works and then

00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:50,030
surprise they all work and you should

00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:55,300
start to feel uncomfortable right like

00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:59,030
this existential like what have you done

00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:01,130
okay okay so things work in browsers but

00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:02,810
let's let's look at the spec like this

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:06,140
is not a speck I wrote this is like the

00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:09,200
w3c CSS object model draft spec so which

00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,640
one's correct obviously number four is

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,960
correct does anyone think one two or

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:19,520
three are correct no clearly not but but

00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:22,520
they're all actually correct now so okay

00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,590
that's weird we had to change the spec

00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,180
because so many websites depended on

00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:29,330
these things and if you go look at the

00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:32,630
CSS style declaration web IDL interface

00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:34,570
as one does you'll notice there's these

00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:39,140
things called WebKit case attributes

00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:42,530
which is the lowercase W when when the

00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:44,330
Dom said so at one point people thought

00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:48,320
vendor prefixes were this really cool

00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:51,230
idea there's like boo hiss right

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,310
terrible idea but perspect number two

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:57,160
they said okay if you're going to do a

00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:57,160
prefix you need this capital prefix

00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:03,140
Apple decided to do a lowercase prefix

00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:04,760
it's you know it's real easy to get like

00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,650
specs are confusing so that that's not a

00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,170
huge deal but then they also decided to

00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:11,690
support this number three which is kind

00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:13,160
of just like the way you write CSS and

00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,840
so we had to stick so we made this

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,760
special WebKit cased attribute and

00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,380
there's there's an algorithm to get you

00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,990
from here to there and there's this

00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:24,620
dashed attribute so those those exists

00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:28,000
in those work and that's why these types

00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:31,460
of web pages break is because people

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:37,190
wrote some CSS and it worked on their

00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:38,870
device so ship it to production right if

00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,280
you had to guess why this page was

00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,110
broken what would you guess like it's

00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:48,440
your day job to fix number one the one

00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:50,769
on the left any idea I hear people

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,179
saying like WebKit prefix background

00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:54,059
and background position wine you're

00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:56,290
absolutely right right so stuff that

00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:57,579
necessarily wasn't in the standard but

00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:00,279
made sense and browser vendors

00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:03,189
implemented we standardize on those and

00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,779
and here whenever you see this type of

00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:09,339
thing like your gut reaction should be

00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:14,110
like flexbox right old flexbox that the

00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:15,549
scary one okay so but really like

00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,019
layouts not the only thing that can go

00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:20,790
wrong there's there's a couple instances

00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:23,350
of other kind of interesting

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:26,259
compatibility differences so we at some

00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:29,549
point in gecko we said all right we need

00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:32,559
to support WebKit prefixed CSS gradients

00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:36,399
to make these pages look nice I think

00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:39,249
there's an example my cursor works so

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,920
there's this button right here it's just

00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:44,379
boring and green and you'd never want to

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,799
click it but this button has this

00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:51,850
amazing gradient you feel very confident

00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:53,290
about clicking it so the same thing so

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,529
we implemented that and we we suddenly

00:13:53,290 --> 00:14:00,189
broke stripe which is not nice to do so

00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:02,589
we couldn't ship this to users yet and

00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:05,679
if you look what happens in Chrome or an

00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:07,600
apple safari you'll notice that gradient

00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:12,730
on the text right the best payment flow

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:16,149
and that's like super hot right so good

00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:23,439
it's like purple to kind of pink it's

00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:25,389
amazing and looking at the CSS it's like

00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:27,369
okay so what's the deal we support

00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:29,049
prefix gradients like why does this not

00:14:27,369 --> 00:14:30,699
work and we discovered there's this

00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:34,360
other thing called WebKit background

00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:36,100
clip text there actually is a spec for

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,079
background clip but there the the text

00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:42,069
value was was never really allowed and

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:48,040
so we had to write a spec for that as

00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:49,600
well you're welcome so so it's spect

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,850
right and and now this actually works

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,220
like this is this is cross browser code

00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:56,679
that doesn't exist in the w3c spec which

00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,269
is kind of odd but it works everywhere

00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:01,149
like so that's what that looks like in

00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:03,100
Firefox an edge has the same thing and

00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:04,360
so you can start to think of like wow

00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,779
these api's have

00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:10,810
terrible names true but they work and

00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:15,640
now you can get that kind of like super

00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:16,959
slick gradient text effect that's very

00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,399
important for your product and there's

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,459
there's other cool features that you can

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:25,120
do things that Apple invented I'm the

00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:27,550
CSS working group never really either I

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,320
don't know how that all works but they

00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,550
never get made it into a spec so here's

00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,620
this really cool effect where you've got

00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:35,740
the gradient text as well but you also

00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:37,029
have kind of this blocked out typography

00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,269
effect right you notice how you're just

00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:41,769
seeing the outlines and here's what that

00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:45,339
would look like in another browser and

00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:46,810
clearly that won't work its way better

00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:50,230
the other one so that's a thing called

00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:53,800
WebKit tech stroke okay so let's let's

00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:55,420
take a break raise your hand if I'm if

00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:00,959
I've made you uncomfortable at all in

00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:04,390
this talk right yes okay like I agree

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:06,130
this feels wrong like we shouldn't be

00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,450
putting prefix in specs we shouldn't be

00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:10,420
browser should be supporting other

00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:17,079
people's browsers prefixes if that was

00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:18,640
even english so i should say there's a

00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:20,680
couple CSS working group members here

00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,839
and they probably are very unhappy but

00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:27,820
also they're probably incapable of

00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:32,160
emotion because they work with CSS just

00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:34,149
kidding that's love those people but

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,120
that sounded sarcastic but they're

00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:38,980
actually great and they do awesome work

00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,089
let me just say let's remember so like

00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,709
you're feeling uncomfortable and you

00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:46,089
feel like well that's a big ugly hack

00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:52,990
but but remember the web juice sounds

00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:54,640
like a great t-shirt or tattoo like do

00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,140
you want people to have access to what's

00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,390
on the left or what's access on the

00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,310
right so after we what's on the right is

00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:02,500
an apple safari like that's Firefox for

00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:05,199
Android today like once once we added

00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,660
this pile of garbage hacks the web is

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,100
usable and that's that's the most

00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,679
important thing is that people have

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,929
access to information no matter where

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,850
they are what device they're using like

00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:17,770
what their socioeconomic status is like

00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:20,290
can I afford a 700

00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:22,270
phone or can I afford a 100-dollar

00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:26,020
Android and I want to use this browser

00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:28,960
and so this this is something I remind

00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:32,890
myself like years ago I worked at a

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:36,490
company called opera and let's not talk

00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:38,110
about that but like when we do

00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,700
uncomfortable things as browsers and

00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,140
browser vendors you have to remember

00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,160
that users are the most important people

00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,630
and you have to remember that as a

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,100
developer as well like what's the best

00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:50,710
thing for my users and as you know this

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,880
is a w3c design principle so so users or

00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,100
more important than authors or more

00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,740
important than implementers more

00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,210
important than specifiers or just like

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,510
things that are theoretically beautiful

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:06,550
so so always remember the users and that

00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:08,200
kid so I've already mentioned this but

00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,550
it's it's also important to do the right

00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,080
thing so if we're going to if we're

00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:13,120
going to do these hacks going forward

00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,710
hopefully like we're done right like

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,330
we've done the dirty work but let's

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,280
let's write it down and let's make it so

00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:19,630
anyone can do this type of thing if you

00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:23,380
were to invent a web browser engine

00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:24,700
tomorrow you would need to implement

00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,520
these to get the web to work

00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:30,370
unfortunately and so we've done that

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:38,410
work and it's just a couple things like

00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:40,570
not a whole lot okay so at this point

00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:43,210
after your discomfort and your guilt and

00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:45,370
and but maybe you're starting to get a

00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,960
you know see why this is important so

00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:48,490
you ask yourself ok so like what can I

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,460
do to make it so we don't repeat these

00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:54,490
mistakes like I don't want to be doing I

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:59,260
don't want to add more prefixes to gecko

00:18:54,490 --> 00:19:00,400
like I'm we're over that I hope so so

00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,360
here's just a couple things you should

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,740
be doing so you should be reading

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:09,390
standards does anyone know w3c schools

00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,390
yep that's not the one so

00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:19,730
unremember that the w3c has amazing

00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,650
documents and they're legit the what

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,180
working group and be in google

00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,010
developers sides like there's a lot of

00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:27,530
good information that are based on on

00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:31,190
web standards read them and be familiar

00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:33,740
with them and optionally use them so you

00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:35,960
should be testing and this this is like

00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:38,690
the hardest thing right writing test is

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,790
so freaking hard but you should at least

00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,800
be opening up your app or your site in

00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:46,070
multiple browsers like even if you don't

00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:49,220
have like this amazing Travis CI set up

00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:50,750
with multiple browsers automated testing

00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,670
you can you can at least open things up

00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,440
and just kind of click around and like

00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:58,850
does this look like a garbage fire or

00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:07,190
does this look kind of okay I forget why

00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:09,020
that's there pre-release channels you

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,400
should be using these as well like when

00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,750
you're doing your testing like don't

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,030
just look at what's shipping today but

00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:17,240
look at what's coming down the line in

00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:19,610
two or three months and these exist

00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,550
everywhere now so this is really cool so

00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:25,640
you've got dev Edition because nightly

00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:27,080
is krushi you've got an edge inside a

00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,610
preview if you have access to a windows

00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,890
machine if not they have VMs you can

00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,510
download news for free Safari has this

00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:35,750
this awesome tech preview where were

00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:37,610
they they gave up on prefixes they wrote

00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,740
this blog post and more or less said

00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:42,850
like Mike Taylor keeps writing these

00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,850
inspect so we're done

00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:50,640
I like to think that but they said we're

00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,049
just going to ship new api's in tech

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,970
preview their experimental there's no

00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:56,039
more prefixes test them but don't depend

00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:58,440
on them like that's awesome seriously

00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:00,179
that made me really happy Chrome Canary

00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,740
opera developer like so you can see

00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:03,090
what's cuts going to ship in three

00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,850
months there might have been a new API

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:08,130
there the the tc39 people might have

00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:09,990
includes string prototype hamburgers and

00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:12,539
that overrides your string prototype

00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:14,010
hamburgers you can figure that out and

00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:16,169
you can fix this before you break apps

00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:18,270
for your users you should be reporting

00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:20,130
bugs as well you raise your hand if

00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:22,860
you've ever reported a bug to a browser

00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:24,960
vendor that's amazing that's like the

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,270
biggest number of people in this room I

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,799
think half of your mozilla employees so

00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:33,059
thank you but typically like if I've

00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:35,070
asked that question it's like three or

00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:38,940
four people so so keep doing that like

00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:41,580
report plugs to browsers as of today

00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,280
there are public mostly public bug

00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:45,510
trackers for everyone edge hundred

00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,570
percent public now they have this new

00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:49,950
tracker which is great Safari it's kind

00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,179
of a black hole opera it's kind of a

00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,669
black hole but you can at least give

00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:54,840
them that information and don't feel

00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:58,760
like you have to do anything fancy just

00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:01,980
be like URL steps to reproduce good luck

00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:04,140
I helped work on this website called web

00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,520
compat calm and it's not the point of

00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,169
this talk and it's it's not even that

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,950
fancy it's just like a honey pot for

00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:12,270
broken websites and there's a community

00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:14,070
of volunteers and other people that look

00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:15,450
at them and try to funnel those to the

00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,789
right people you know we paying the

00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:20,940
chrome people the Microsoft people the

00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:22,530
Apple people etc you can actually just

00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:26,870
send me an email and be like yo my

00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:32,700
website's broken I might not delete it

00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:34,770
and so that's it I have if you really

00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,630

00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:41,039
