 Dominique Hazael-Massieux: I have been working on Web standards in W3C for 16 years, with a particular focus on their applications to mobile devices. I have been more specifically involved in the development of JavaScript APIs to access new hardware features, and more recently, of the APIs needed for Real-Time Communications (WebRTC). One of my most recent work item is to start standardizing the missing bricks for bringing Virtual Reality to the Web.
