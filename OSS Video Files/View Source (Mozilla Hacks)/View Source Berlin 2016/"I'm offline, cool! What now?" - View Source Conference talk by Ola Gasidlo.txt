Title: "I'm offline, cool! What now?" - View Source Conference talk by Ola Gasidlo
Publication date: 2016-10-03
Playlist: View Source Berlin 2016
Description: 
	We learned a lot about the offline first concept in the past two years including Service Worker, CouchDB etc.

Did we do everything already to make our applications offline first? Is caching the resources enough? Did we answer all the questions already and if not… What are the new questions we need to answer?

In this talk, I’ll show you what has changed in the last few years, how people did adapt the concept and what are the best practices.

And most importantly, can offline first help to save lives?
