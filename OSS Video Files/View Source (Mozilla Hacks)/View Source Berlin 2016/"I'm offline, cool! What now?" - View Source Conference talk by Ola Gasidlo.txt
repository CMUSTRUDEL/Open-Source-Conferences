Title: "I'm offline, cool! What now?" - View Source Conference talk by Ola Gasidlo
Publication date: 2016-10-03
Playlist: View Source Berlin 2016
Description: 
	We learned a lot about the offline first concept in the past two years including Service Worker, CouchDB etc.

Did we do everything already to make our applications offline first? Is caching the resources enough? Did we answer all the questions already and if not… What are the new questions we need to answer?

In this talk, I’ll show you what has changed in the last few years, how people did adapt the concept and what are the best practices.

And most importantly, can offline first help to save lives?

welcome to the talk about best practice

00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:16,010
first and learnings together across the

00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,110
pulse for years my name is a legacy to

00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:21,350
land a lead developer at stodden

00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:23,600
Institute angakok jess and organizer of

00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:26,450
barriers conferences meetups and way

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,700
more so today I would love to tell you a

00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:31,160
little bit athle about the actual state

00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,530
of offline first how our point of view

00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,540
has changed in the past few years and

00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:39,500
how it's actually adapting to the real

00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:42,350
world before Stuart I like to mention

00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,990
that this talk in this talk I speak

00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:47,360
about the pandemic and death there won't

00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:49,790
be any graphical display of those topics

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,630
but just to let you know in advance and

00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:55,160
there will be a lot of gifts as usual so

00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,990
if you're at the leaf because you do not

00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,030
feel comfortable with that I fully

00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,920
understand and I'm super happy to chat

00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,830
after the talk plus give you like a

00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:07,820
short summary of the content okay let's

00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:10,420
start internet turned 25 this year so

00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:13,040
amazing times we all live in right in

00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:16,039
this time our relationship with the

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,749
internet it changed a lot we do

00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:21,200
different things with different devices

00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:24,350
than 25 10 or even five years ago and

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,140
it's a part of our everyday life we rely

00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:30,679
on our devices and the internet put an

00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,450
exchanged three years ago when the

00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:34,969
offline first movement got like broader

00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:38,420
attention I gave my first talks about

00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:41,329
offline first concept that was 2013 what

00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:45,889
was our idea back then why did we need

00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:48,380
the oven first concept so badly first

00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:50,659
thing was the rise of the mobile devices

00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,119
and the usage their countries where

00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:56,689
people do not even use desktop devices

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,539
anymore at all when you think about how

00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:01,399
cheap a phone in comparison to for

00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:05,270
example a laptop is it totally makes

00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:07,429
sense right a mobile device is mostly

00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:10,819
enough for everything you consider the

00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:14,690
users actually needed for also there was

00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:16,310
the still is the issue of no constant

00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:19,030
connectivity or poor network coverage

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,700
here of them first felt like a huge and

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:30,490
meant to our application and the new

00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:34,959
behavior so 2016 three years later what

00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:38,080
do you think we still needed tell me by

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:42,030
raising your hand who view is already

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:46,959
building offline first applications a

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:49,720
few awesome who view things they're kind

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:54,280
of know how to build and how to hold the

00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:56,500
correct approach to offline first which

00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,440
is good because still haven't figured

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:02,019
that one out so trying to probably

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,050
totally right with it and who have you

00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:10,660
things offline first concept as

00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:13,840
progressive enhancement okay good to

00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:16,239
know after seeing Oakland first in the

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,670
wild we've realized it not just about a

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,890
special use case or the rise of the

00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:25,720
mobile devices it's about the whole

00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:28,510
approach it's just so much more let's

00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,850
check our table 1 set offline first

00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:34,420
means getting on screen without a

00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:36,670
network request the more that it's there

00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,340
before the network the more offline

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:42,340
first it is this means every web

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,410
application should work without a

00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,510
connection after the very first visit

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:49,180
and just use the network for getting

00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:53,650
getting and setting new data everything

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:56,260
else is on line first so remember me

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:59,829
asking you like way ahead three slides

00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:04,600
ago if progressive enhancement often

00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:07,180
first you remember well quite many of

00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,450
you said yes totally and what about tell

00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:13,060
you that you're actually wrong this

00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,890
might sound confusing but why is the

00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:19,299
offline first concept progressive

00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:21,729
enhancement like actually it's not

00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:24,160
because it's the other way around let's

00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:26,740
take a step back and see why do we need

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,260
applications normally we use our

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,840
applications for everyday lives so to

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:34,300
make it be easier better

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,880
whatever you want like checking in with

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,470
family members and other loved ones a

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,820
broader just texting your partner during

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:45,690
the day using slack arcia cetera at work

00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:50,020
especially in remote teams this all

00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:51,610
comes down to communication we also need

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,010
application for like checking your data

00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,479
like did I'm not drinking off during the

00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,740
day how much money they are spent that

00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:02,470
week but also how can i fix my bike on

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,419
my washing machine how did I translate

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:08,889
that sentence or even did i spell that

00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:13,030
right basically that is all about

00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:15,630
information posting selfies formal

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:18,310
ossification tweeting your thoughts

00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:23,380
discussing etc checking in symptoms were

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:25,450
sick or even check the internet while

00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:30,150
your kids act out doing that all the

00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:35,080
time this is all about empowerment and

00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:39,669
the most important thing there is cat

00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:42,580
gifs which is a basic life need and I

00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:47,440
think we all can agree on that so this

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:50,800
one sums up to love when we look at

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,220
those points communication information

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:58,450
and Parliament love we all can break it

00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:01,120
down to help and satisfying very basic

00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:04,780
human needs for safety belonging esteem

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,470
and self actualization muscle of defined

00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:13,150
all those points in this here Achilles

00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:15,789
in 1943 so since when is helping to heal

00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:19,450
people a basic human need progressive

00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:22,120
enhancement but we love to sell it that

00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:23,710
way so people jump on the progressive

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,510
enhancement train and just redo the

00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,570
application like every six weeks and the

00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:32,039
new cool framework or whatever they need

00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:32,039
without knowing what the real issue is

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,770
kind of tired of those have done rock

00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,080
and shivered applications which are

00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:43,120
released out in the wild without any

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,230
kind of documentation pretty much

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,810
nothing because

00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:50,320
wanted to reflected applications really

00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:54,670
quick in this new cool stuff and yeah

00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:57,550
temporary we all know that right so we

00:06:54,670 --> 00:07:00,790
have all the super super slow and buggy

00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:04,270
and messy applications just because of

00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:07,000
bad planning and messy architecture we

00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:09,640
think we do not need a new over or

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,280
Twitter really trust me we tend to

00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:16,240
forget that this our jobs it's about

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:18,580
people humans not about frameworks not

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:23,470
about tag design patterns or discussions

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:25,030
about semicolons don't build a town when

00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:28,150
you actually just need a house just

00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:30,490
because you can especially because

00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:34,060
normally you always end up with a

00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:36,280
gorilla banana problem he wanted a

00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:39,270
banana but what you got was a gorilla

00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,170
holding the banana and the entire dunham

00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,240
every time you use a whole

00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:46,270
infrastructure like a framework to solve

00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,200
one problem you get all this implicit

00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:52,060
environment that carry around with them

00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:55,990
it's all about keeping things simple but

00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,670
solid basic but optimized this is why I

00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,450
think putting off line first in the

00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:03,070
progressive enhancement slot is pure BS

00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:08,380
dunno what progressive enhancement part

00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:12,250
of the application is the network so you

00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:17,310
might ask yourself why should I care my

00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:17,310
app is work are working right are they

00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:25,210
ever check the application without a

00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:28,030
connection or with a bat one how

00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:30,370
productive are you for example when just

00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:33,400
one servers like it helped us down not

00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,930
to mention the office Wi-Fi how easy is

00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,660
it to communicate with it with your

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,910
friends on a concert for example when

00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:43,349
everyone is sending like live streams of

00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:43,349
the concert through the phone

00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:51,280
and besides us with a good connectivity

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,370
situation blessed people there are

00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:57,120
others so we're not just the wealth

00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,260
Western web as Bruce Lawson once defined

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,230
forty-three percent of the population

00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:05,230
has access to an internet connection and

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:08,770
just a small amount of those to a false

00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:10,990
and steady one and data is expensive as

00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:13,290
you can see here on this list province

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:16,030
Ward's talk about performance metrics

00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:19,830
Germans would have to work for less than

00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:23,800
one hour for 500 and be people in India

00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:27,190
about 70 so let's assume you have a

00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:30,130
500mb plan right so this would mean you

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:34,480
can visit almost seven websites per day

00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:38,220
nothing else you could watch one video

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:42,490
like one talk in this month and then

00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:45,040
done or you could make people really

00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,950
really happy and write all the me emails

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,140
you're actually procrastinating on

00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:52,540
without the judgment of course so the

00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:55,720
application should provide the base and

00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:57,640
work diff offline / default the network

00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,450
is to want to enhance the application

00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:03,220
with new outside data no matter which

00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:06,130
technology stack we actually use

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,860
peer-to-peer network huh what's the

00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:11,680
quick direct connection to the server or

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:14,620
USB stick whatever works to transfer

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,840
your data it's not important how you

00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,540
transfer the data or application on your

00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:22,420
device what is important that you helped

00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:29,320
save everything locally and enhance the

00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:31,270
sink through network not sure this is

00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,880
true let's check out what is happening

00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:37,330
in the real world when and how others

00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:40,990
solved else on issues let's start with

00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:43,570
the router so imagine a beautiful

00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:45,310
morning you've decided to work remotely

00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:48,190
because we old without on her vacation

00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:50,410
right and you're sitting in an internet

00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:53,220
cafe so it love to check your emails

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:56,110
cool connect the laptop to the router

00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:59,260
open the email app sent the request to

00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:01,780
get the emails closed laptop

00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:07,200
in the evening like wait what evening it

00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:10,360
wasn't just morning well actually

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,540
there's no physical connection that the

00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,580
internet cafe is using like a cable they

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:20,890
just have a router that saves a request

00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:25,150
and connects buy a bluetooth to a bus it

00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:27,790
sings and the request since the request

00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:30,760
and off it goes literally the bus

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:32,080
arrives at a stop half of the route to

00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,170
the hotspot with a physical connection

00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,810
and syncs with another bus also

00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:41,380
exchanged all the data plus passengers

00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:44,490
and luggage the bus is synced by a

00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:48,070
bluetooth previous requests and results

00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:50,800
both buses return literally and yeah you

00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:54,280
get to you miss hopefully if you were

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,760
able to authorize the tech behind the

00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,350
snc net servers is a combination of NSC

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,570
zone city and routing and the document

00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:04,810
not to be confused with the darknet by

00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:06,640
the way so what our learnings here

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:10,810
especially in focus on requests and

00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:13,480
essence check your requests do you

00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:16,750
actually need 20 request a will to

00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,820
actually just to be enough please serve

00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,880
ugly fight and mini fight falls because

00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,890
yes it matters the stylist matter and do

00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:28,330
you really need that five and B

00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:32,560
background image formal one beware of

00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:35,110
life I'm life I is the state where you

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,090
device checks your connectivity

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,270
situation and assures your you

00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:43,110
definitely online pinky promise but

00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:46,720
there's actually no data passed through

00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:48,610
you should we could go also it's like

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,460
checking the bandwidth after the very

00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:53,620
first Bing right yes yes that could be a

00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,440
thing and we could develop something

00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:59,650
similar like media careers Ford and

00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:02,230
device sizes just for bandwidth that

00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:04,870
will be great so we could load assets /

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:07,720
detect a true bandwidth right yes

00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:10,330
mind-blowing might be a great idea but

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,800
the bandwidth can differ per request in

00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,339
per package especially when you're

00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,490
moving

00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:18,069
example on a train who would need to

00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:21,160
ping not just per every request but

00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:25,029
constantly every can't so we can't rely

00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:28,300
on request to come back please add a

00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:30,819
timeout to kill your request or make the

00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:36,160
appt work fully independent of

00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:39,160
requesting data this is why we also need

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,699
to separate updating cycles of assets

00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:46,379
and data the update of assets is less

00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:51,360
important than actually sinking the data

00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:53,920
save a basic set of you I locally and

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,499
just to go easy on the start so very

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,019
basic and enhance that for example with

00:13:56,499 --> 00:14:01,930
vet fonts images whatever you floats

00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:04,689
your boat offline should be the default

00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:09,759
state and we need to make the bandwidth

00:14:04,689 --> 00:14:12,040
assumption per device you detect take

00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,769
responsibilities of the caches and keep

00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,019
them clean what could be better to

00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:19,050
manage caches if not service worker and

00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:21,970
nope no introduction to service worker I

00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:25,389
think we have enough people to do that

00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:27,759
today just one thing if you want to use

00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:29,970
app cache for quite a bit because

00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,889
browsers are dropping the support hard

00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:34,929
but also for migration from app cash to

00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:42,339
service worker please check out the j

00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:44,550
cash images heart already but hard to

00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:47,800
deal with even more with in delphi first

00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:50,319
context saving images in the in browser

00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:53,290
storage good way to go but still very

00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:55,389
painful because of starch limitations

00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,209
and very different story limit

00:14:55,389 --> 00:15:00,759
implementations porting the current of

00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:03,309
images like logos for example to SVG and

00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:06,160
see us as a great way to go to cut off a

00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:08,589
little bit of the overhead encoding

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,879
assets and base64 in storing the string

00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:12,459
and the browser storage of your choice

00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:14,889
could be also way to go for example

00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:16,509
saving points like that and loading them

00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:19,689
straight from the start improves the

00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:21,819
performance enormously then it's

00:15:19,689 --> 00:15:24,279
impossible for images like logo but

00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:26,380
please do not do this for all of your

00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:28,880
images because i've already seen it

00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,620
don't built the town where you just can

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,740
do and you just need a house just

00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,360
because you can remember the springs a

00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,540
huge as we already know and the in

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,550
browser storage are limited also decom

00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:43,220
big base64 on the fly it's very very

00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,080
heavy task it slows down your site

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,330
especially in combination with dom

00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,330
manipulating frameworks like greg for

00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:53,360
example and you might run is run into

00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:55,820
race conditions there also so first

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,680
example now the second one this one is a

00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:03,560
little bit heavier suit million vance

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:05,300
the panic 2014 and 2015 the Ebola

00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:09,320
epidemic in parts of us africa was a

00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:11,420
really scary issue i was involved in a

00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,209
project but the enjoy he had the Africa

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:16,940
to build two applications to help stop

00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:21,920
the pandemic the first application was

00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:24,410
to solve an issue with providing

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,270
information because information is the

00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:31,160
key to prevent to spread the pandemic

00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:32,959
and kill the process was the population

00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,329
was informed about a specific number

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,300
that could call to ask questions about

00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:40,820
Ebola symptoms to report someone sick or

00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:43,250
even dead the call center tracked the

00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,720
calls within with the application we've

00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:48,640
built and collected all the data they

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:51,740
need it and send out a team if needed

00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,720
they edit information through the

00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,329
application like name location

00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,670
additional information also edit the

00:16:56,329 --> 00:17:00,649
phone number of the caller so when they

00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:03,620
had my questions I had to fill up mr.

00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:05,390
could do it data analysis and filtering

00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:09,290
was really easy thanks to that

00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:12,589
application we fought with issues like

00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:14,600
unexpected and constant power loss the

00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:17,089
generators jumped back in after quite

00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,790
some time but we could not afford to

00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:22,459
lose data just one case could have

00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:26,510
caused another outbreak and kill many

00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:29,120
people so whatever learns here

00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:31,970
especially about data was the couple's

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:35,630
server and clients to serve the needs of

00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:38,179
a ventral contingency built in a task

00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:40,340
message system that can act

00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:43,279
independently from the connectivity

00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:45,639
situation for example Fidelia kalsi be

00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:48,529
especially in combination with pouch

00:17:45,639 --> 00:17:52,249
prove the usability in real world really

00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:54,529
well couch to be a no sequel database

00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:57,139
that replicates is pretty much exactly

00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:59,659
what we want cows to be comes with the

00:17:57,139 --> 00:18:01,340
suture features that we need such as on

00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:04,279
the fly document transformation real

00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:06,379
times change certification we need those

00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:10,129
for the message control system but also

00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:11,809
for decoupled architecture pouch to be

00:18:10,129 --> 00:18:13,970
is no console's JavaScript library

00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:15,730
inspired Picasso API is pretty much the

00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:18,710
same buddy of limitations are different

00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:21,249
and it's designed to run well within the

00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:23,899
browser and store all your data locally

00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:27,470
it syncs with couch be thanks to the

00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:28,970
couch to be replication protocol so when

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:32,929
your application is back online they

00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:34,340
ping each other and with pods should be

00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:35,779
we actually have documents which are

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:39,320
stored locally so we don't flush the

00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:42,080
caches by accident one of the biggest

00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,509
issues for syncing data are a merge

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,970
conflict because parts would be and

00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:49,129
couch speak the same protocol and sync

00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:52,820
automatically when we're back online we

00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:55,639
do not need to take care of that second

00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:58,789
application we developed was to actually

00:18:55,639 --> 00:19:00,980
track patient data in the field after

00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:02,360
examining the impact of patients which

00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,820
had to stay in quarantine for like

00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,470
twenty one days the team added the data

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:09,409
to a general database through the

00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:12,889
application + Co black rep results from

00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:16,369
several different entry points and very

00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:18,590
different file types the data was

00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:21,590
imported and saved at to a global

00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:24,169
database it was synced then all across

00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:30,259
all of the devices we had this one's

00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:33,980
pretty messy but we cleaned it up so one

00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:35,690
another learning was about schemas we

00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,360
added an organization system an

00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:40,669
interface to map the data in one defined

00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,549
schema the schema was flexible enough to

00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:46,399
be extended if needed thanks to a no

00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:48,499
secure database behind it that it was

00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:50,050
imported automatically when it arrived

00:19:48,499 --> 00:19:53,350
mostly / mail

00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:55,900
and we added data on the fly constant

00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:59,220
automatic testing and high test coverage

00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:01,800
for the important interface wasn't must

00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,780
the schema and testing helped us a lot

00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:07,330
here to prevent merge conflicts prada

00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,550
get go kasabian power should be helped

00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:14,140
us to take care of sync merge and

00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:16,840
flexibility big bonus also the schema

00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:19,060
also helped us with making a filter and

00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:23,560
analyze the data so visualizing it was

00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:26,290
really easy we hope to curtail the

00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,270
pandemic because of clean data structure

00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:31,570
and constant testing for the application

00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:33,730
if anyone else like tells you now that

00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:35,800
you don't need that stuff or you don't

00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:39,310
have time for that now you know what to

00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:43,750
reply right okay so almost lunch people

00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:47,050
already leaving sorry well the next use

00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:50,230
case and its last one is I guess well

00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:55,570
picked then sorry in advance it's about

00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:58,210
the pizza so we all have to order food

00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:01,000
right did he ever check the local

00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:03,340
storage while ordering like if you they

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,940
saved the items in the bird locally a

00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:09,550
friend of mine did at once and she went

00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,140
a bit further out of curiosity so he was

00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:14,230
wondering if they're actually validating

00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:16,600
the check out on the server he

00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:19,300
manipulated the check out and subtracted

00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:22,360
two swans and send it out and waited the

00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:28,300
pizza came and nope no server side

00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:31,750
validation cheap food so also learning

00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:33,550
some security and conscious to the

00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:37,000
limited possibilities of our use case

00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:40,090
before this company could have validated

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,700
the data on the server right but this

00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:44,860
sometimes it's not possible especially

00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:48,760
when everything needs to work without a

00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:50,920
request security is a very new topic to

00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,320
offline first and not many tools are

00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:57,040
provided yet and I would like to ask you

00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:59,260
after this talk and later in the PWA a

00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,790
discussion also let's talk about it

00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,549
let's discuss it I'm really curious

00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:06,260
about hearing your thoughts about it

00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:08,840
although many of us seem to hate curry

00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:11,149
sometimes it provides already a great

00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,669
set of features and rules to make

00:22:11,149 --> 00:22:14,870
applications more safe but it does not

00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:18,110
solve the issues with the in browser

00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:20,510
storage manipulation one way to go would

00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:23,059
be to encrypt your data when you use

00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:27,470
pouch to be you can add crypto pouch

00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:29,270
which encrypts the pouch documents well

00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,950
big salad downside of that as the

00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:33,980
documents get encrypted but not the ID

00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:35,840
so when you reverse engineer there are

00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,480
still security issues but at least you

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,330
can't manipulate the data in the console

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,149
anymore when you want to encrypt the

00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:45,860
data you just might want to look in

00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:48,590
surprise which does not work without a

00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:52,250
request right so there's a way to use

00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:55,190
tokens in the client Jason DEP tokens is

00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:57,049
great album industry standard methods

00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:59,029
were representing claims securely

00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:01,220
between two parties which is exactly

00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:05,090
what we want it makes decoupled and

00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:08,270
secure sink and inclination possible ok

00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:10,610
short bonus level because this is pretty

00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:13,580
much the most creative Hughes case of

00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:17,470
ever seen and ever heard about how

00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:20,330
someone sold the offline issue the rally

00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:24,140
anyone of you ever heard about the

00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:26,590
already before patricia hand okay just a

00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:29,330
very few it's non-conventional ready

00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:32,029
where people start from either london o

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:33,740
czech republic they drive down to

00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:35,600
mongolian the main intention of the

00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,299
rally was that donate your car program

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,419
when you actually make it to mongolia

00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:43,159
because the cars had to be really old so

00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:48,470
they could be donated without importing

00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:51,230
duties 2009 a team from spain took part

00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:54,529
in the rally nothing special here at

00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:57,649
first plans well the issue of the rally

00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:59,270
was they had to trust a lot of countries

00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:03,140
with different reception different

00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:05,600
payment models for data they needed a

00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:08,390
way to communicate with loved ones and

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,820
just to say yeah we're cool or could you

00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:13,830
send some money and bam me out of jail

00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:18,929
please sorry

00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:22,679
so they built a system that could encode

00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:25,409
an esky message in 8-bit binary code ran

00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:28,409
that through eight phones that actually

00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:31,080
call just one number this is how it

00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:33,630
looked like to save money that didn't

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:36,830
establish like a fool connection short

00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:40,890
ring was a zero long ring was a one and

00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:43,220
at the other end check the numbers which

00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:45,779
was set for the order of the bits

00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:49,019
decoded the esky of the binary back in

00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:52,860
ASCII sent out the message my blowing

00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:56,010
ray humans learnings the very last

00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:58,289
learning here rethink how to use

00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:01,320
technology by thinking about the issue

00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:04,649
not about the tools unidirectional

00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:07,350
communication it's so basic they fixed

00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:09,720
it already in the beginning by thinking

00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:13,830
about the real issue and not about the

00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,659
solution first so time is up I hope you

00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:18,049
had a really great time and if you have

00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:20,610
any questions let me know and remember

00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:24,210
it's not about frameworks or design

00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:28,580
patterns tools or semicolons it's all

00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:28,580
