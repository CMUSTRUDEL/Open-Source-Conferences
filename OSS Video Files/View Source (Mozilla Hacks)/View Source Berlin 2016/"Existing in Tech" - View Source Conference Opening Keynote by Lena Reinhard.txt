Title: "Existing in Tech" - View Source Conference Opening Keynote by Lena Reinhard
Publication date: 2016-10-03
Playlist: View Source Berlin 2016
Description: 
	Over the past few years, several CSS methodologies and JavaScript frameworks have been released. In one year, we receive 32,120 business emails. Every weekday, we're active on Slack for 2 hours 15 minutes. Technology is moving fast, and constantly, there's so much going on. We constantly have to adapt in an ever-changing environment, while somehow still doing our job of building proper, functioning software to the latest tight-super-unrealistic deadline.

This talk will look at the human side of our daily work in technology. Together, we will examine which factors affect us physically and emotionally in our work. We'll learn how they lead to pressure, stress, self-consciousness and ultimately burnout, and we'll find out how to identify early warning signs of being affected. You'll leave with a realistic look at your own, human capabilities, and the knowledge of what you can do to take care of yourself while working on software.

have you ever taken a very deep breath

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:17,260
and held your breath and let yourself

00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,820
the water like in a swimming pool and

00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,480
have you ever felt what it's like to be

00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:25,849
floating in water or under its surface

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,950
and have you ever wondered what it's

00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:30,349
like to be an astronaut floating in a

00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,450
space trouble what it's like to be

00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:35,840
flying to work flying to lunch and

00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:38,450
flying to bid have you ever wondered

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:44,600
what what it would be like to see Earth

00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:48,859
from space and have you ever been to

00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:52,250
Mars as a child I've been extremely

00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:54,140
fascinated by aerospace I grew up in a

00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:57,530
small village in a hilly area in rural

00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,829
Germany nearby rocket engines for

00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,839
european space programs were tested and

00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:05,650
during bigger engine tests a big cloud

00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:09,370
would pop up behind the hills near by i

00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:12,320
always got excited when I saw that cloud

00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:14,420
at home the walls in my room were

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,580
wallpapered with maps of the stars and

00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,790
with infographics on the solar system

00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:22,190
and during meteor showers in August I'd

00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:27,020
sometimes camp outside and make a wish

00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:29,260
every time I saw a shooting star there

00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,860
are three things I learned back then

00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:36,410
rocket engines are incredibly powerful

00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:38,420
shooting stars are super beautiful but

00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:42,160
the stuff they tell you about their

00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:45,350
power to fulfill wishes not true and

00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:50,030
when I grow up I want to be an astronaut

00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:53,600
I didn't become an astronaut but

00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:56,270
sometimes I feel like one I feel like

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,730
I'm in a very dark place like an

00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,500
astronaut in a space ship but my

00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:03,440
spaceship has run out of fuel a long

00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:07,460
time ago and it's just in free fall in

00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:11,150
space with no power no direction and no

00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:14,750
control I feel far away from Earth and

00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:18,290
completely detached even from people who

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:24,409
were once very close to me I feel so

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:26,510
lonely so incapable and so so numb being

00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:28,710
an astronaut in a space ship with no

00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,530
fuel on a mission that went or

00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:35,160
be wrong this is what my depression

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,140
feels like I've been living with

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,360
depression for many years of my life and

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,810
I've had two burnouts since I started

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:48,240
working in tech and there are a few

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:50,310
reasons why I'm talking about this by

00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,820
the time we're born almost all neurons

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,860
that our brain will ever have a present

00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:58,200
our brains need to reach near ninety

00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,720
percent of adult size by about age six

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,130
to seven but the rational part of our

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,380
brains is only developed by about age 25

00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:10,080
our mature brains are composed of more

00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,600
than 100 billion neurons and in some

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,090
areas of our brains even in our adult

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:20,030
life new neurons are still continually

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:22,470
born this process is called neurogenesis

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:25,020
our brains also create new neural

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,000
pathways and alter existing ones to

00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,910
adapt to our environment and to new

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,820
experiences our brains are able to

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:37,650
change throughout our lifetime this

00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:39,420
ability is called neuroplasticity what

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,970
felt like being in a spaceship to me

00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,160
will feel and be very different for

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:48,030
anyone else who lives with depression or

00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,800
other mental health issues but mental

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,930
health issues can affect anyone and

00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,480
research shows that they're encouraged

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:59,190
by biological psychological and

00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,650
environmental factors fact is twenty

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,620
five percent of people in the world will

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,410
be affected by mental or neurological

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:11,940
disorders at some point in their lives

00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:14,160
that's every fourth human but despite

00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,890
being so common mental health issues are

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:21,120
still extremely stigmatized in our

00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:23,070
societies and in the tech industry the

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,740
stigma is dangerous since it leads to

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:30,530
people lacking information not knowing

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,530
how to get help and how to get that help

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,710
another reason to talk about mental

00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,600
health in tech though is the tech

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,590
industry as an environment that

00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,590
influences us

00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:46,710
the closest that mass has ever been to

00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:49,260
earth was in 2003 when it was fixed 56

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:52,170
million kilometers from Earth that's

00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:55,050
more than 145 times the distance between

00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:58,290
Earth and Moon or as I like to call it

00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:00,570
super super far away just getting to

00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:04,620
Mars takes at least about six to nine

00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:06,570
months to study Mars scientists have

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:11,010
been sending spacecraft there since the

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:13,710
1970s 11 of these 13 spacecraft are not

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:16,280
operational anymore and harshly spoken

00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:19,740
have turned into about a tons of trash

00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:22,490
but to Mars rovers are still operational

00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:27,750
at the moment one of them is called

00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:29,760
curiosity in august 2013 the curiosity

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:33,360
rover's celebrated its first birthday on

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:38,790
mars by humming happy birthday for

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:41,310
itself out there all alone so what is it

00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:46,710
like to celebrate your birthday on Mars

00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:49,800
all alone Mars is a global desert that

00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:52,500
sees intense the storms surface

00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,190
temperature ranges between minus 140

00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,810
degrees to up to 35 degrees Celsius and

00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:01,920
seasons are about twice as long as on

00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:05,100
earth there's no ozone layer to block

00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,470
solar ultraviolet radiation air pressure

00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,940
is much lower than on earth as well as

00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:13,860
the oxygen in its atmosphere all in all

00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:18,750
Martian surface is not hospitable to

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:20,370
humans so scientists are trying to

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,820
understand what going to this human

00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:26,010
unfriendly place would mean for humans

00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:29,640
one way to do this are simulated Mars

00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:32,070
missions in one of these missions six

00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,260
people spend one year in a small dome

00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:37,470
shaped habitat on the flank of a

00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:39,450
Hawaiian volcano in their year there

00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:42,060
they were only allowed to leave their

00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:45,390
habitat in spacesuits and for showtimes

00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,940
to conduct research on Mars and all

00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:50,400
their communication with earth was

00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,849
delayed by 20 minutes to simulate space

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,160
travel

00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:57,410
the goal of the simulation was to help

00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,050
scientists understand what keeps space

00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:04,150
flight crews happy and healthy on Mars

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:06,830
missions mass is a harsh environment

00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:09,979
that will deeply influenced the lives of

00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:13,180
astronauts on Mars missions and as an

00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:15,620
environment the tech industry is Mars

00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:18,889
it's an environment with systemic issues

00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:25,550
an environment that's not hospitable to

00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:27,889
humans and here's why first of all the

00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,889
tech industry has become a planet of its

00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:33,380
own far away from human life on earth

00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:36,770
and detached from caring about the

00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,780
problems that humanity is facing it's a

00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:41,180
system built on privilege by the

00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:43,789
privileged producing products for the

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:48,979
privileged and a system that widely

00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:50,930
exploit less privileged people the tech

00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:54,020
industry is deeply shaped by oppression

00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:57,169
within our societies like racism sexism

00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,240
and ableism all of which accumulate

00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:03,740
again in this industries organizations

00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:06,500
and communities this industry lacks

00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,870
empathy and compassion for the people in

00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,020
it people use the products made by this

00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,969
industry and for the people affected by

00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:18,919
this industry's input impact on

00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:21,830
societies it's an industry that keeps

00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:23,599
telling itself it's a meritocracy which

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,969
practically means that a whole industry

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,750
relies on a judgment system that was

00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:32,060
invented as a joke it's an industry that

00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,729
systematically ignores biases and power

00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:39,680
dynamics so it can keep pretending it

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:41,870
was objective it's an industry that

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,260
celebrates its heroes because they funds

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:47,029
done something great for the community

00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:50,020
this hero culture is disempowering

00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:52,160
because it sets impossible standards and

00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,320
this hero culture has been harmful

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,990
because these past achievements have

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,930
been used to defend and keep celebrating

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:02,680
these heroes regardless of their present

00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,680
hurtful actions

00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:07,860
in this list of privilege and tech

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,810
systemic oppression lack of empathy

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:15,460
so-called meritocracy and hero culture

00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:17,940
isn't even complete all in all the tech

00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:20,860
industry is not hospitable to humans

00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:24,990
it's broken environment that harms

00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:28,030
humans image and beyond at large scale

00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:30,490
but despite the conditions in this

00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:34,090
environment many of us enjoy being in

00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,920
tech and to some of us comparing this

00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:40,900
industry to Mars may seem far-fetched

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:43,090
but like the tech industry as a system

00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:47,170
is privileged so are many of us as

00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:50,980
individuals factors like our gender race

00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:52,360
education upbringing appearance physical

00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,690
and mental health and many more

00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,970
determine our privilege this privilege

00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:00,430
means that some of us can exist in this

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,230
industry with ease gain influence and

00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,900
are accepted without scrutiny or

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:10,750
suspicion which gives us advantages

00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:12,730
relative to other people thing is if you

00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:15,250
are in a high tech space habitat with

00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:18,930
all suppliers you need you don't have to

00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:23,200
worry about dust storms outside on Mars

00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:25,090
privilege is a space habitat the more

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,890
privileged we are the less we are

00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:30,220
directly exposed to the harshness of

00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:32,800
this industry privileged in tech means

00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:37,420
we're able to hide from the storms from

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:41,980
the cold and the radiation on Mars but

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:43,900
who has access to this space habitat the

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,810
tech industry is mostly homogeneous

00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,910
space in Europe more than seventy

00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:51,070
percent of people in tech and more than

00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,370
ninety percent of software developers

00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:55,780
arm in numerous groups of people are

00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:58,500
usually underrepresented in this

00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:01,860
industry by people of color women

00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:05,350
non-binary people lesbian gay bisexual

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:07,240
disabled people and many more for

00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,280
everyone who is part of these groups and

00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,820
their intersections this protective

00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,800
space habitat is less accessible and

00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:17,010
this influences their experiences in

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,010
tech

00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:21,939
being a member of an underrepresented

00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:25,540
group in tech means getting paid less

00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:27,579
for the same work it means having very

00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,129
few role models and less access to

00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:33,910
career opportunities since leaders in

00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:36,129
tech are most places white mean it means

00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:38,470
constantly having to prove that you're

00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:40,749
worthy of being in this space because

00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:45,309
you don't match the stereotype of what a

00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:47,319
nerd looks like it means not being able

00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:51,699
to stand in the daily stand-up because

00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:53,319
of the disability or illness being a

00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:55,600
member of an underrepresented group in

00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:57,579
tech means not being able to go to tech

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,980
events because they're not safe not

00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:02,319
accessible because they're not inclusive

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:07,209
for parents all because tickets are too

00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:10,029
expensive it means facing her racism

00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:13,869
misogyny transmisogyny and other forms

00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:15,970
of oppression every single day it also

00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:18,220
means seeing people like you being

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:21,249
harassed and always knowing that you

00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:23,169
could be next and it means seen people

00:12:21,249 --> 00:12:27,519
lose any joy they got out of programming

00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:29,709
ones because of it it also means never

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,290
being able to be fully yourself at work

00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:36,249
or industry events because it would be a

00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:38,410
risk for your safety and it means being

00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:41,009
in an industry that prides itself in

00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:43,600
disrupting outdated practices an

00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:46,209
industry which at the same time is

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,089
completely incapable of making its own

00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:54,879
organizations inclusive safe and

00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:56,679
welcoming for everyone all in all being

00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:59,319
a member of an underrepresented group in

00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:01,749
tech means being in a cold space with

00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:07,149
constant dust storms and being unable to

00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:08,949
breathe and a studies show people who

00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:12,160
are affected by structural oppression

00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:14,679
like racism sexism or harassment are

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:20,139
more likely to develop mental health

00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:22,449
issues no matter who we are no matter

00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:25,869
what we do and no matter how privileged

00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:29,209
we are this industry affects every one

00:13:25,869 --> 00:13:32,449
of us and it affects some of us

00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:34,269
more than others this is why we need to

00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:36,800
talk about mental health in check and

00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:46,759
about structural oppression in this

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:48,980
industry the tech industry should not be

00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:50,660
Mars and none of us should be in a

00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,149
position where we need to protect

00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:55,399
ourselves from the systemic systemically

00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:59,269
broken environment from dust storms and

00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:02,329
radiation many people in tech have found

00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:04,189
good companies events communities or

00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:08,420
other spaces that are safe and good

00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:10,519
spaces for them but we need systemic

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,610
changes in this industry and we need

00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:15,829
them now we need this industry it's

00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:19,579
organizations and communities to become

00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:23,839
diverse inclusive accessible safe and

00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:25,399
respecting spaces for everyone many

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,360
people are working hard on making this

00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:36,379
change happen but it takes time and for

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:39,980
the time being Tech is Mars so for now

00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:41,449
there are mostly workarounds there are

00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,549
some things that I've learned in my

00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:46,100
years in tech that helped me be in this

00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:49,639
industry and things that help me live

00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,990
with my depression I'm privileged in

00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,329
many ways though and not a medical

00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:56,899
professional so what works for me may

00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:59,629
not work for you these things that I've

00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:02,569
learned have become my spacesuit and my

00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:08,660
oxygen tank and this is what it looks

00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:11,179
like first of all remember that you

00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:13,970
mattered people may question your

00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:17,809
identity your value your being in this

00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:20,329
industry but you matter your needs and

00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:26,209
your well-being matter you're a valuable

00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:29,749
person never forget that use the power

00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:32,869
of language language shapes reality and

00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:35,149
naming things can be very powerful it

00:15:32,869 --> 00:15:37,639
can turn seemingly random observations

00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:41,580
into something concrete can change our

00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:43,560
perspective and our position

00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,960
it took me a long time to understand

00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,300
that my never-ending tiredness my panic

00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:50,520
attacks and my endless bade thought bad

00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:54,510
thoughts were not something random but

00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:56,550
signs of depression it also took me a

00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:58,950
long time to understand that the issues

00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:01,440
I was facing in tech are not all signs

00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,270
of my personal and capabilities but

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,390
rooted and oppressive dynamics in this

00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:13,020
industry named oppression when you see

00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:16,140
it practice self-care figure out what

00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:19,980
nourishes you physically emotionally in

00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:22,200
all aspects that make you you self care

00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,450
practices can be things like taking a

00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:28,110
few deep breaths going for a short walk

00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:30,810
or listening to a song you like whatever

00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:33,600
it is self care practices are about what

00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:36,720
helps you recharge feel safe and

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:43,290
supported find out what does that for

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:46,470
you and do it do only one thing but do

00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:49,170
one thing in my times of heavy

00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:51,210
depression all my tasks including

00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:53,460
getting out of bed in the morning would

00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:57,360
often feel like a gigantic frightening

00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:59,750
pile so I developed a habit of trying to

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,400
focus on one thing at a time and

00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:04,860
nowadays I still use this technique

00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:08,370
especially when I feel overwhelmed by

00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:14,430
too many tasks last weekend writing this

00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:17,220
presentation was my one thing try to get

00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:19,350
professional help this can mean seeing a

00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,449
doctor calling a hotline for people in

00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:23,970
crisis participating in an online

00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:28,050
self-help program joining a self-help

00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:30,480
group or doing therapy my therapy has

00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:32,130
helped me gain more strength and a

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:39,260
better understanding of the reasons for

00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:43,410
my struggles set and enforce boundaries

00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:46,550
all of us are human our time our energy

00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:49,380
our emotional resources are limited

00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:51,470
learning this and starting to enforce my

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,210
boundaries has taken me many years and

00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:56,460
it can be very hard in an industry

00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:59,010
that's constantly trying to push people

00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,720
beyond the elements and very often in

00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:04,380
the name of doing something for the

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,990
community pushing back against this

00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,600
pressure can be hard but watch out for

00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:15,360
your boundaries and if you can enforce

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:17,880
them learn and recognize warning signs

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,220
for bed organizations and safe

00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,280
communities and harmful individuals in

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:28,650
this industry and if it's somehow doable

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:31,920
for you try to avoid them be open about

00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:33,810
your experiences in tech all of us are

00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,360
affected by this industry in some way

00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:38,850
and effects on or mental health can be

00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,590
part of that if you're in a position

00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:43,620
where it's possible for you and feels

00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:46,380
okay speak up about your experiences in

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,930
this industry or about mental health in

00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,360
check raising awareness about these

00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:57,930
topics can help other people and can

00:18:51,360 --> 00:19:00,720
help reduce stigmatization remember that

00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:03,030
you're not alone in this I've been

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,400
socialized to see other women as enemies

00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:08,820
because only one person can be on top of

00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,500
the career ladder right it took me a

00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,840
long time to understand that this is a

00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,720
technique used to turn underrepresented

00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,940
groups against each other and that there

00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,160
are many people in tech who face much

00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:24,750
harder oppression than I as a sis white

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:27,000
woman do now one of my greatest sources

00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,910
of empowerment in tech other networks

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,130
I've become part of places where met

00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:35,040
people who understood who are facing

00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:38,910
similar issues and who I learned so much

00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:42,540
from regardless of your gender sexual

00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:45,060
orientation ethnicity age background or

00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:48,060
your native language there are people in

00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:50,160
tech who are like you you may still be

00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:56,610
part of an underrepresented group but

00:19:50,160 --> 00:20:00,000
there is a group know that there's a

00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:01,800
spaceship keep in mind that there's the

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,980
option to leave the tech industry and

00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:07,350
leading tech is neither a sign of giving

00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,820
up nor a sign of failure

00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:11,919
like travel from Mars to earth takes

00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:15,309
time this may not be think about all

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:20,669
possible for you right now but know that

00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:23,620
there is a spaceship and finally if

00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:25,779
being in tech is a great experience for

00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:29,610
you and feels like a comfortable space

00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:31,960
habitat for you to be and support others

00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:35,620
educate yourself about systemic issues

00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:37,539
in tech show empathy and solidarity call

00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:39,909
out that behavior by other people in

00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:43,779
your space habitat and help makes

00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:46,779
community spaces safe and fight for

00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:48,429
change in this industry many people are

00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:53,019
working on change for justice and

00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:55,779
equality in tech most of us are members

00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:58,750
of underrepresented groups ourselves so

00:20:55,779 --> 00:21:01,659
join us in our work work on becoming an

00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:09,190
ally and help us change these systems

00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:11,460
for better future my space suit for mass

00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:15,519
is made up of things like self care

00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:17,559
professional help networks and more your

00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:21,029
spacesuit may look very different from

00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:25,830
mine find out what is good for you and

00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:25,830
find out what your space suit looks like

00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:36,039
have you ever taken a very deep breath

00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:37,809
have you ever wondered what it's like to

00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:43,230
be an astronaut floating in a space

00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:43,230
shuttle and have you ever been to Mars

00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:48,760
still there are many days when I don't

00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:51,700
want to put on my spacesuit again and go

00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:54,640
out there on the rocky dusty stormy

00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,260
mouse and there are many days when I

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,980
feel like an astronaut in a tiny space

00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:02,110
straddle far away from Earth but there's

00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:05,470
one very good thing about being in my

00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:10,570
tiny spaceship at least I get a great

00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:13,330
view of the stars no matter who you are

00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:16,029
no matter where you are in tech or where

00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:19,330
you are in your life remember that you

00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:21,940
matter you're a valuable person your

00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:26,649
significant relevant and worthy of note

00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:29,740
and when you go out there again onto the

00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:33,159
dusty rocky surface of Mars take good

00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:36,340
care of yourself no matter where your

00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:40,110
journey leads you then I wish you safe

00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,110
travels thank

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,380
