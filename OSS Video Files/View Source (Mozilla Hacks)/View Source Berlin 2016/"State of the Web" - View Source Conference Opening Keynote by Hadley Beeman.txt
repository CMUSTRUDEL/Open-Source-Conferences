	00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,990
I'm here to talk about the state of the

00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,990
web and specifically building the future

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:19,570
there are three things I want you to

00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:23,980
take from this talk you ready the future

00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:28,240
is not built yet we don't all agree what

00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:31,869
the future should be and we need you to

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:36,730
help create the future got it that's

00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:38,739
where we're going today right let me

00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,559
introduce myself and tell you why I care

00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:44,079
about this stuff I'm hadley Beeman I'm a

00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:46,660
software engineer by training and a data

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,879
architect specifically but the most

00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,620
interesting data is on the web or should

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,329
be on the web so I've spent the past

00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,719
four years working with the World Wide

00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:59,440
Web Consortium w3c on making the web

00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:01,329
better I currently chair the w3c's data

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,280
on the web working group which is

00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:06,130
working on making the machine readable

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,170
web better we've just put out a draft

00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:11,530
best practices document this is useful

00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:14,320
things like use restful api s and put

00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,270
unique identifiers in your data and we

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,729
now need to show evidence that the stuff

00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,860
is happening in the wild so if that's

00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:22,960
your thing do let us know if you're

00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:27,850
using anything we've documented evidence

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:30,159
is good I'm also a member of the w3c

00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,140
technical architecture group who are

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,259
responsible for stewarding the

00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,960
architecture of the web we regularly

00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:41,530
debate what that means but essentially

00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,240
ten of us including tim berners-lee meet

00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,990
weekly to look at the big picture of the

00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,969
web architecture where it's going review

00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:51,159
the specs for new standards that working

00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:54,759
groups are putting together look for

00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:57,040
conflicts holes it's a fascinating

00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,509
position from which to think about what

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:03,130
the web is and what its future should be

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,579
when I'm not working on web stuff I

00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:08,229
advise governments about technology I

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,060
just finished a job as the digital and

00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:12,610
technology advisor to the Cabinet Office

00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:15,160
in the UK and we'll talk more about

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:18,280
government's later they have a role to

00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:22,120
play in building the future too

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:25,030
so this is my view on the world one foot

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,860
in code in standards and one foot in

00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:31,330
decision-making and big picture thinking

00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:33,400
and if nothing else I can tell you both

00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:40,739
would be better with more participation

00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,739
by you so let's get into what that means

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:49,150
we can start with a brief summary of the

00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:52,900
past we started with Tim's first summary

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:55,120
of his approach in 1991 when he said the

00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:58,000
world wide web consisted documents and

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,519
links the web contains documents in many

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,340
formats those documents which are

00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:05,530
hypertext real or virtual contain links

00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,950
to other documents or places within

00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:11,830
documents all documents whether real

00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,750
virtual or indexes look similar to the

00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:18,760
reader and are contained within the same

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:25,450
addressing space sound familiar that was

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:26,980
the world of HTTP TCP and DNS HTML gave

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,519
us the language to describe what we

00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:34,450
wanted to do actually first it was sgml

00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:36,600
but never mind that but the web was a

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,560
dynamic collection of static documents

00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,890
initially trying to make sense of

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,140
research information again in Tim's

00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,480
words it was based on the philosophy

00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,579
that much academic information should be

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,310
freely academic freely available to

00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:53,260
anyone it aims to allow information

00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,000
sharing within internationally dispersed

00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:59,320
teams and the dissemination of

00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,630
information by support groups we started

00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,950
working on open standards then and Tim

00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,560
and his colleagues were adamant that

00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:10,750
this should be for everyone but the user

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:14,650
needs were relatively simple so let's

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:18,459
fast forward to the present we now have

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:21,280
a much more dynamic interactive web we

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:24,460
have things like CSS for making display

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,680
is more efficient JavaScript for running

00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:30,370
functions

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,830
SVG for animations we also have a

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,330
struggle going on all these open

00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:38,350
standards are up against native

00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:40,420
platforms iOS and Android among others

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,570
provide more functionality than we

00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:46,840
expected from the web early on so we've

00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:49,650
had to get creative we now have service

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,060
workers and the notifications API and

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,010
intersection observer to help us make

00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,870
the web platform is attractive to users

00:04:54,010 --> 00:05:00,690
and developers as the native platforms

00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,690
are we're making significant progress

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,280
we're also handling loads of personal

00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:09,640
and sensitive data that wasn't a focus

00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:13,750
in the early days of the web credit card

00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:19,120
numbers content of emails browsing

00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:22,410
history location data we've needed SSL

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:27,100
and now TLS to sensibly protect them

00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:31,300
cores the same origin policy the

00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:34,720
permissions API and we're still finding

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:37,420
our way through this we now have 25

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,510
years of legacy technologies for better

00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:43,480
and for worse live out there on the web

00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:46,030
and of course we can't just announce

00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,580
that these are now the rules and expect

00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:53,380
everyone to follow them deprecating

00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:55,360
stuff is hard change is hard just last

00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,390
year we in the tag came out with a

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,550
finding that unsanctioned tracking which

00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:03,700
is tracking a user in ways they don't

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:06,880
expect or having agreed to is it how the

00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:09,310
web should work because there exists

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,150
enough ways between fingerprinting and

00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:15,730
super cookies to do it fairly thoroughly

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:17,590
unfortunately but that breaks down the

00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,440
trust between the user and the developer

00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:23,500
which ultimately makes the web less

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:28,150
useful these are the sorts of things we

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:30,730
need to worry about now so the present

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:34,420
is indeed evolving and it's a bit

00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:36,760
chaotic our open standards are competing

00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,090
not only with well resourced controlled

00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,210
UX environments

00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:43,310
like the native platforms we also have

00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:47,210
fully proprietary technologies running

00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:49,970
on top of them we have flash well some

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:52,910
of the web still does and we have eme

00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:55,850
encrypted media extensions protecting

00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:58,250
copyrighted movies and music running

00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:02,840
through an open API but the encryption

00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:05,750
itself is proprietary we're getting into

00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:09,020
a weird hybrid there's a lot more to

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:12,050
discuss the web of things automotive

00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:15,200
standards that's web technologies for

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:18,680
the entertainment in your car and TV

00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,810
controls geofencing for advertising

00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,130
depending on how close you are to the

00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:26,000
coffee shop where you have a loyalty

00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:30,740
card we're branching out there's a lot

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,570
going on worth mentioning that we in the

00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,880
tag are trying to keep these various

00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:37,760
efforts in some kind of a cohesive web

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,800
architecture it means we get to do

00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,470
things like realize as we did in our

00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,150
last face-to-face meeting that there are

00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:47,150
more than five different kinds of device

00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:50,030
IDs should your site need to talk to a

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:53,030
user's printer for example in five

00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:55,669
different w three specs built by five

00:07:53,030 --> 00:08:01,729
different working groups we're trying to

00:07:55,669 --> 00:08:03,560
make sense of that so busy exciting lots

00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:06,800
of legacy features that much of the web

00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,620
still uses and lots of amazing new

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,200
things the web can be and do much of it

00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,630
being created by people like you who sit

00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:22,520
down and say what if the world worked

00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:24,860
like this hold on to that thought so i

00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:29,060
started this section by saying that the

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,650
future isn't built yet it's not we're in

00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:34,099
a totally different world than when the

00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:36,080
web started in the early 1990s but what

00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:38,620
happens when the primary user agents of

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,089
the web aren't in phones and laptops

00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,789
what if touchscreens are built into

00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:47,780
every countertop and desk surface what

00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:51,030
then what if the users of the web aren't

00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:54,540
just people how much could a

00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:56,970
create new web interactions and how much

00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:01,110
will the bots have user excuse me user

00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:04,020
needs to moving a bit down the network

00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:07,170
stack what if the web isn't restricted

00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:10,920
by our current limitations traffic

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:14,400
routing paketsize the physics of signal

00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,020
transmission what if we find some way to

00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,580
collapse the network stack into

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,090
something orders of magnitude more

00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:23,340
efficient Google is having a go at it

00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:27,060
with quick which they've brought to the

00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:30,350
IETF to become an RFC have a look at it

00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:33,840
it's an interesting thought experiment

00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:37,260
and practical implementation not just

00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,940
thought what happens when the bulk of

00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,120
the web isn't controlled by a few

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:45,120
companies or what if those few companies

00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:48,420
become even more powerful who will they

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,450
be and what will they do who will keep

00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:57,150
them accountable how will the web stay

00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:59,370
open what about security we designed

00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:02,700
these standards and protocols once upon

00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:04,980
a time primarily for sharing we're

00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,410
already trying to retrofit security to

00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:11,490
the web platform what will that look

00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:16,490
like in 10 20 years what costs will it

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:18,900
have in processing time power efficiency

00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:22,710
how much will it matter when quantum

00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:26,900
computing is everywhere and what will

00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:29,760
the role of the web be in people's lives

00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,740
we have a lot to design for now but

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,620
there's so much potential that most of

00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:37,800
us haven't considered sci-fi actually

00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,770
plays a big role here as does sitting

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,750
down and hacking something together a

00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:45,390
lot of fun features in use on the web

00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:49,950
now have come from somebody saying what

00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:52,110
if I just did this but again I'm hinting

00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:55,790
it your role in this that's my third

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,790
point we'll get there

00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:04,700
we don't all agree what the future

00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:07,490
should be there are three main types of

00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:11,390
authorities that I work with standards

00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:13,070
bodies governments and users and web

00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:16,070
developers and the tech industry are

00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:17,510
part of that third group each is working

00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,910
on figuring out the future in their own

00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:23,260
way and each has their own areas of

00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:27,920
power we'll start with standards

00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:29,840
standards bodies like the w3c largely

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,380
bring people together to agree the bits

00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:35,330
we all have to agree on for example for

00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,340
the instructions on my server to render

00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:40,430
in your browser and your browser and

00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:42,590
your three devices we all agree that I

00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,940
will use these HTML elements and your

00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:48,050
browsers will render them in the

00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:50,410
following predictable ways standards

00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:52,520
development tends to work in two ways

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:56,660
sort of like deductive and inductive

00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:58,820
reasoning the first is looking at what a

00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,350
lot of people are already doing and then

00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,000
bringing all of them together to

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,730
formalize that that's the way this

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,340
should be done service workers are a

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:09,170
great example of this most of the

00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:12,530
browser behavior standards are created

00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:14,300
this way the second way we build

00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:16,280
standards is by bringing group of

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,310
experts together to figure out how

00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,290
something should work we tend to build

00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:25,940
vocabularies and semantic web standards

00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:27,680
this way they're not always the trick to

00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,990
this approach is to make sure you have

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,590
enough different people who can agree

00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:35,000
eventually in the room early on and then

00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:38,750
that you can show that their ideas are

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,700
actually in use in the wild we want to

00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,430
make sure this is a useful process and

00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,530
not the results of say to people in a

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:48,050
whiteboard deciding one afternoon that

00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:53,680
this is how the world should work that's

00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:55,970
not always very effective shifting gears

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,110
governments tend to look at the future

00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:02,570
in terms of while the people they serve

00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:05,060
will our citizens be educated can they

00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:08,150
communicate with each other and the rest

00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:10,830
of the world is their economy successful

00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:12,920
can they buy and sell things easily with

00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:17,190
customers who aren't in the same city is

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:18,630
their information safe incidentally

00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,270
governments are grappling with what

00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,860
their role is in this and the time I

00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:25,380
spent at the UK government digital

00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,210
service was that country statement that

00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,800
being a part of the part of being a

00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,560
British citizen is digital public

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,540
services there's a social contract

00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,350
negotiation going on there that's

00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:39,300
happening in just about every country

00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:41,490
anyway governments use the levers that

00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:45,420
they have things like funding tech

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:49,380
development taxation outlawing things r

00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:53,010
and d to shape the future for their

00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:55,680
citizens Tech and the web is a fairly

00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:58,050
new area for them compared to say

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,960
collecting taxes which some of our

00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:02,160
countries have been doing for millennia

00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:06,120
so most of them are working out how to

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,540
navigate all this and that brings me to

00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:12,540
the third Authority developers and users

00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:14,730
the people who just try stuff this was

00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,950
Tim and his colleagues giving hypertext

00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:20,040
documents with links ago in the early

00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:22,830
90s this is everyone at a hack day or

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,140
alone late at night who just says what

00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:30,240
if the world worked like this and built

00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:32,340
it that stuff catches on the best way to

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,160
convince other people to do things your

00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:38,880
way is to show them how useful it is and

00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:43,460
then they'll jump in you have a huge

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,460
amount of power here be aware of that

00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:49,110
anyway each of those authorities has a

00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:52,980
certain power that others don't have a

00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:57,090
trump card to play for standards bodies

00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:59,310
its legitimacy and momentum a technology

00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:01,230
catches on faster when it's been through

00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:03,870
and is endorsed by known standards

00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:07,680
process most of the time there are

00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:10,260
exceptions for governments it's making

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,950
laws and throwing around huge amounts of

00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:15,950
money which gets stuff built invented

00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,950
created

00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:21,019
and for developers it's the freedom to

00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:23,300
just jump in and build stuff you don't

00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:25,579
need anyone's approval you don't need to

00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,730
build a business case you don't need to

00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:30,829
negotiate with a hundred other companies

00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:34,430
you also have physics and logic on your

00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:37,839
side when rules get in your way you can

00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:43,670
build around them or optimize for them

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:45,470
that's pretty significant so each group

00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:48,980
has a big role to play in working out

00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:52,670
the future of the web do they ever

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:55,610
disagree absolutely of course they don't

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:59,449
always agree shall we review some of the

00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:03,860
past few years conflicts within

00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:07,480
standards bodies ads cookies ad blockers

00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:11,060
Do Not Track browser fingerprinting to

00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,709
lots of different agendas and user needs

00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:19,430
and perspectives about what's right

00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:21,170
there eme which has us questioning again

00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:24,139
where are the boundaries of the open web

00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,990
is an open API with prior to a

00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:30,230
technology still part of the open web

00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:31,730
lots of discussion there they've been

00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,750
conflicts between us is techies and

00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:38,060
governments in areas like net neutrality

00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:42,949
copyright enforcement digital rights and

00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:44,930
privacy spam we've seen conflicting

00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:49,160
roles of governments between different

00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:52,069
countries question for you whose job is

00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:55,009
it to protect an unsuspecting user from

00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:58,970
an unscrupulous company taking advantage

00:16:55,009 --> 00:17:00,769
of their data a few weeks ago I brought

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,560
this up a tad enter dinner with an

00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:06,470
international group the Brit at the

00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,630
table agreed it was an issue the Italian

00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:11,720
said government must protect the little

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:13,490
guy it should regulate and the American

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,780
thought it was a contractual arrangement

00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,780
between the user and the company

00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:20,510
government should stay out of it not

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:22,569
much agreement there so what's the right

00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,569
answer

00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:28,220
and that's just a selection the

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,639
disagreements and the negotiations

00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:34,100
continue in perpetuity which is actually

00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:40,279
healthy it leads us to a more effective

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:43,999
balanced open web let's talk about what

00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:46,399
we do with those disagreements for

00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:48,470
standards bodies we've set up the

00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:51,409
processes in our standards bodies to

00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:54,379
build consensus you're all familiar I

00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:58,220
imagine with the I etfs mantra rough

00:17:54,379 --> 00:18:00,470
consensus and running code the process

00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:03,350
to create a standard is optimized for

00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:05,509
public input reality checks against what

00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:08,210
works and making sure that no one

00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:11,960
interest can hijack a standard for their

00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:15,230
own benefit this is time-consuming but

00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:19,460
reasonably effective so there is lots of

00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:22,249
discussion at that level for governments

00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:24,799
at least in Western democracies which of

00:18:22,249 --> 00:18:28,460
the government's I know best the public

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:30,289
feeds in in two ways first choosing

00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:34,340
their representatives who then make the

00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:37,809
laws second responding to an informing

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:41,119
debates on proposed laws and policies

00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:43,480
there's also option three go work for

00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:45,710
them which is much more time consuming

00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:49,610
but a great opportunity to make a

00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:51,230
difference I've really enjoyed it each

00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,629
country does these things in different

00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,970
ways but there are opportunities to jump

00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:57,830
in to tell them what regulation is

00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:03,789
helpful and where to invest their R&D

00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:08,889
money so I'd encourage you go for it and

00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:13,039
as developers what's useful gets adopted

00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:14,840
jfgi is often rewarded we are ruthless

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,879
about borrowing what works for others

00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:20,149
and looking at how someone else has

00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:23,179
solved a specific problem we try not to

00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:25,279
reinvent wheels we look over each

00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:28,399
other's shoulders ask for help when

00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:32,259
we're stuck code is published all over

00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:34,909
the web hello we're at view source

00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:37,840
discussions happen on github on Twitter

00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:39,980
in forums and on IRC

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,750
we're not always great about that

00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,210
sometimes the online discussion

00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:47,830
degenerates considerably there is a

00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:51,610
problem we need to solve but we do talk

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:55,910
we're a community the open web movement

00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:58,160
we're working out stuff in the open we

00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:00,590
resolve our disagreements with running

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:06,890
code the consensus often comes later

00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:09,910
which is fine so this is my main point

00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:13,040
I've been pretty subtle about a day I

00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:14,240
feel like it may feel like there are a

00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:18,080
lot of web technologies out there

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,300
already and there are it may seem like

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,910
one individual can't be heard among all

00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:26,870
the activity in progress that can be

00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:29,750
hard the truth though is that the web

00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:33,020
thus far has been built by individuals

00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:35,690
and similarly our governments are made

00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:37,820
up of individuals who ultimately get

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:42,080
rewarded based on how life works for

00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:45,140
their citizens that's us again and our

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:49,340
to-do list is so big the web could be so

00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:52,370
much better more helpful safer good in

00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:57,830
yet to be imagined ways that we can't

00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:59,810
possibly do it without your help as you

00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,730
go through the next two days digging

00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:05,060
into the details of progressive web apps

00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:07,790
or layout and topography think about the

00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:11,570
future you want to live in to and how we

00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:15,850
can build it some specific questions I'd

00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:18,260
love you to think about first economics

00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:21,350
how do we encourage people to write

00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:22,520
articles make movies and music if the

00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,890
internet makes it harder for them to

00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:27,380
earn money for it should we make it

00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:30,230
easier for them to earn money we are

00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:33,140
working on micro payments is that enough

00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:37,640
is it in the right place and what about

00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:39,130
ads who is in the right as in ads should

00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:46,290
we be optimizing for publishers

00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:48,960
advertisers or users second security

00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:51,720
how do we make the web secure when we

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,750
originally optimize it for sharing what

00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:59,460
efficiency or speed or features are we

00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:03,360
willing to give up what do we gain what

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:07,170
compromises are we all right with third

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:10,590
digital rights as this becomes more of

00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:13,410
an everyday issue not just for a few of

00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:14,730
us how do we build a web that helps

00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:17,100
users understand what they are sharing

00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:22,320
about themselves and what threats they

00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:23,970
face the web is a system we're good at

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,480
thinking about systems right that's what

00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:30,870
we do how do we think about this one how

00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:34,380
do we improve this one the rules are

00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:39,060
fluid because we make them the potential

00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:41,880
impact is huge and you we have the

00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:45,890
ability to shape the web what should it

00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,890
be thank

00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,070
