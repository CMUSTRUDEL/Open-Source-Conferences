Title: "Inclusive Markup" View Source Conference talk by Estelle Weyl
Publication date: 2016-10-03
Playlist: View Source Berlin 2016
Description: 
	Accessibility is the law and a good idea. Let's make the Web accessible and fast for everyone. We'll skip "why" and focus on "how." Accessibility can be as simple as using the right semantic elements in your HTML. Semantic HTML can prevent bugs, improve performance, reduce code bloat, and make your site accessible to screen readers and keyboard users. We'll explores accessibility features native to semantic elements, adding a sprinkling of ARIA roles and attributes. Form controls, input masking, styleable selects, and carousels with a few lines of CSS, fewer lines of JS and no frameworks.

hi my name is Estelle and my last name

00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,220
is

00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,320
and the slides are going to be up at in

00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,539
startlogic that

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,970
logic github do you remember that and

00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:25,520
all the slides for all of my talks are

00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:27,560
there and the reason I speak at

00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,160
conferences is because i am a twitter

00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,470
 so that is my that is my twitter

00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,080
handle Estelle V W follow me that makes

00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:40,460
me happy I also write books if you have

00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:43,839
insomnia they're great I basically read

00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:46,670
read specifications so you don't have to

00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:51,110
and my flexbox book should be coming out

00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:53,690
in a few weeks I work it in startlogic

00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:58,280
and we make websites fast so let me get

00:00:53,690 --> 00:01:00,890
into my talk this is an example of a

00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,899
website that I created it's actually a

00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,030
marketing page that I created 40 photo

00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:06,500
which became kodak gallery which was

00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:11,270
part of kodak which no longer exists

00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:14,450
back in 2004 it's or 2003 maybe it's

00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:19,909
table list and this seems simple to do

00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:23,479
nowadays but back in 2003 and 2004 this

00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:26,049
was my first framework i had to check if

00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:31,310
it supported a document.getelementbyid

00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:33,290
or whether it's supported document all

00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,729
or document layers to know if it's

00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,950
supported javascript and simple

00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:39,470
functionality the reason I created this

00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,540
framework was because I was supporting

00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,880
older versions of Netscape older

00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:47,810
versions of ie anyone here work on

00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:53,030
Netscape 4.7 aren't you glad you don't

00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:56,479
have to do that anymore so the original

00:01:53,030 --> 00:02:00,079
purpose and goal of frameworks was to

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,509
basically even out browsers so we didn't

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,250
have to code you know so we didn't have

00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:06,200
to every single time we make a function

00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,390
code for every single different browser

00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,260
mostly for add event listener that's why

00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:15,110
we had jquery and for because it was

00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:18,829
attached event in IE add event listener

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:22,220
in every modern browser that purpose is

00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:23,449
not as important anymore I mean it's

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,400
important to even our browsers but

00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:27,310
browsers are pretty even add event

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,210
listener has been supported since ie9

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,500
get element my class

00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:34,790
name the selectors API and class list

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,670
cross-listed get supported til I eat n

00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,770
it's very easy function to code but

00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:43,310
getattribute has been around since

00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:45,290
forever so if you're just going to be

00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:49,550
doing something simple do you really

00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:51,710
need a framework so frameworks are good

00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,150
I don't think that you should be using

00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:56,170
frameworks I just don't think you should

00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:58,790
be using six frameworks at the same time

00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,830
frame works enable you to write code

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,170
really quickly to make it support in

00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:05,630
every single browser and it also allows

00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,280
you to gain the knowledge from you know

00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,320
4,000 people instead of just yourself

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,810
there's someone who probably knows some

00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,060
features better than you do for me it's

00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,740
the performance of my JavaScript I'm not

00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,210
I don't know much about JavaScript

00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,970
performance in terms of functions in

00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:23,870
which one's going to go faster it allows

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:26,240
you to do less code into code faster but

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:30,260
I don't ever want to see anyone do this

00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:33,560
and I've seen this I've seen this so

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,330
many times importing a framework or a

00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,260
library for something that the browser

00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:40,730
can simply do with one line of CSS I

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:44,840
have someone to laugh and back laughing

00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:47,780
hysterically and yes that's a fireable

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,660
offense the way I view frameworks is

00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:53,240
kind of as a scaffolding when I'm

00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,340
prototyping doing quick prototyping I

00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,310
will include everything so i don't have

00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,440
to code everything myself but i don't

00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:06,830
ship by 55 thousand lines of code to

00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:08,300
production because that is insane so you

00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,900
know be wise when you're choosing

00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:14,180
frameworks so kind of why am I harping

00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:17,870
on frameworks right now when this is an

00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:21,620
inclusive markup talk because I think a

00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:23,780
dependency that people tend to that some

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,940
people have on frameworks means that

00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:29,150
they're not learning the basics of being

00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,890
a web developer the downsides of relying

00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,290
on frameworks is you don't actually know

00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,930
the mark-up you don't know what some

00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:38,210
people don't know what they're putting

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:40,220
into their browser they don't understand

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,390
what valid markup is they're not fully

00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,150
cognizant of this

00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:45,200
every single element and they don't even

00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,090
know what all the elements are

00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,610
attributes are they're relying on their

00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:52,100
framework or library to do everything

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,780
for them they're not thinking about

00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,200
accessibility because they're told oh

00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:59,360
this framework improves accessibility it

00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,830
only improves accessibility if you know

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,290
how to make it accessible in the first

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,720
place some people are arguing that you

00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:08,450
should just do inline CSS I want to

00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,460
punch them in the face I don't have an

00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:13,070
opinion on that and then the other thing

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:16,730
is the performance every time you

00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:18,560
include a line of JavaScript which a

00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,360
framework is going to have many lines of

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,070
JavaScript and if you include many

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,320
frameworks you're going to have tons of

00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:27,250
lines of JavaScript that JavaScript has

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,020
to be downloaded parsed and executed

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,730
there's the download time but there's

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,330
also the parsing an execution time which

00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:38,030
means your browser is basically not

00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:40,670
functional for your user and it enables

00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:43,310
laziness which I'm all for but more on

00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:45,890
that later so what do we not learn when

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:50,810
we're using frameworks here are the

00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:54,320
html5 inputs and attributes and this is

00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:59,410
a Firefox browser and so we have fuel

00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:05,270
from Firefox in the room fix that now

00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:07,790
please but some of the other features

00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:10,670
are awesome and they're supported and

00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:13,340
one of the best things that they do like

00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:15,320
email and tell type is they give the

00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:19,100
right keyboard when you're on a mobile

00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:22,220
device with a dynamic keypad right so

00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:25,040
you don't want if you have if you're

00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:27,050
looking for only numbers do you really

00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:31,250
wanted to touch tiny little buttons or

00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:34,370
do you want the telephone keypad ok so

00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:36,380
there's also some attributes that people

00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,940
don't really learn about because they're

00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:42,590
letting their frameworks do everything

00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:44,660
for them so learn the HTML input type I

00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:47,570
actually have a one and a half hour talk

00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:49,580
there is a there's a presentation online

00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:52,060
which is just a half hour if you want to

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,680
learn all the form controls it was from

00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,900
2011 or

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,900
well it's online still the same stuff

00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:03,150
other than daytime that would be on

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:05,800
Estelle vachetta ba tyo so this was a

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:08,110
quote from a talk from R Us Weekly that

00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,600
he gave a few weeks ago which was many

00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,979
developers who have grown up using only

00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,259
frameworks have a total lack of

00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:16,630
understanding of the fundamental of HTML

00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:18,310
such as valid and semantic markup the

00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,600
main point of this quote which I am

00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,880
reading to you even though you all know

00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,729
how to read is this is of great concern

00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,930
as semantic markup is one of the core

00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:30,340
principles of the accessible web

00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,560
semantic markup is one of the core

00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:35,800
principles of the accessible web which

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,650
means if you code semantically your

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,490
website is going to be or your web app

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:44,139
is going to be by default pretty much

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,389
accessible there are features that we

00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:49,960
can add to make it more accessible but

00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:52,599
it's inaccessible in and of itself so

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:57,610
this is an example of an inaccessible

00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:59,229
website this is not that we don't know

00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,659
what the text says because we are blind

00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:04,570
and we are accessing this website via

00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:06,820
screen reader and your content has

00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:11,020
really brilliant content and the links

00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:13,419
all say click here is this useful to

00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,940
someone with using a screen reader no

00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:19,659
click here for more information more

00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:21,940
information about what so code your

00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:24,280
content in a manner that is accessible

00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,190
so that just the links themselves

00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,840
provide enough information as to where

00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,849
what you're going to get on the next

00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,339
page not only will people with using

00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:35,800
assistive technologies be thankful but

00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:38,529
Google is your biggest blind user and

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:43,390
Google will know WTF your next page is

00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:48,100
going to to be talking about this right

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:50,680
here is what the web looks like for

00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:54,670
people who are hearing impaired can

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:56,170
anyone read this guy's lips even if you

00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,730
could read lips I think this guy is

00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,589
talking too fast I have no clue what

00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:03,310
he's saying this is what it sounds like

00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:05,140
to someone who is hearing impaired or to

00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,520
someone in this session who is watching

00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,910
a video right now instead of

00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:12,310
to me talk and doesn't have air pieces

00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,600
in or someone who's headset is broken i

00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,980
broke mine on the plane so this is

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,080
exactly what the movies are going to be

00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:23,440
looking like on my way home on my

00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:25,900
12-hour flight and this is actually not

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,310
the right colors to display color

00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,510
blindness so most people should be able

00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:33,370
to read this even if they are colorblind

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:34,890
but it gives an idea of what color

00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,420
blindness might look like and also

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,490
different different abilities or

00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,960
different cognitive abilities some

00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:44,380
people would not be able to read this

00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:49,800
make your websites clear make your color

00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:51,610
contrast make your colors contrast so

00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,450
disability is something we talked about

00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:57,910
but disability what does that mean

00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:00,730
disability is a mismatch between your

00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:04,110
current state and what you are trying to

00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:06,070
access right now so some of us are

00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:08,590
disabled have different levels of

00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:10,660
disability we're not you know when we

00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:12,430
think about disability we should just be

00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:17,470
thinking about people who are paraplegic

00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:20,830
or people who are fully blind there are

00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:22,390
different levels and what is your state

00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:25,960
right now when you're accessing this

00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:27,490
website mine is that my keypad right now

00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,270
is dirty so I'm having a really hard

00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:32,980
time navigating so I would prefer to tab

00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:34,720
that's not really a disability but it is

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:39,310
a current disability because my state

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:42,610
right now is not as perfect as it could

00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:44,530
be so the Americans with Disabilities

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:47,530
asked was past 26 years ago in the

00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:50,590
United States and since then we've been

00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:53,860
having the best sidewalks ever I can

00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:55,600
roll my suitcase everywhere so something

00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:59,470
that was created for wheelchairs is used

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,570
by bicycles it's used by people pushing

00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,950
shopping carts and people pushing that

00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:07,990
thing in the middle that I don't ever

00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:09,700
want to have to push so again there's

00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,680
permanent disabilities there's

00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,450
situational disabilities we often think

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,820
of disabilities as someone in a

00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:18,470
wheelchair but if you're walking with

00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:22,640
stilettos the sidewalks here

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:24,020
in berlin are really hard to use luckily

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,660
i don't know in stilettos but some

00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:28,670
people do if you're outside looking at

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,400
your phone this Oregon computer the

00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:35,840
sun's glare will make your your computer

00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:38,720
harder to read so when it does come to

00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,120
complete visual appearance we have

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,070
something called accessible rich

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,320
Internet applications which is some

00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:49,490
attributes that we can add to our HTML

00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:51,680
to make it more accessible we've had

00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,970
three accessibility guidelines we've

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,450
actually had more but these are the ones

00:11:52,970 --> 00:12:00,260
that are most relevant to us in 1998 we

00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:04,850
had a wicked one and which were kind of

00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:07,100
rules to follow wicked to was in 2008

00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,750
and it said basically instead of being

00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,300
rules it was basically sit make your

00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:16,010
website perceivable understandable

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:19,010
operable and then in just a few years

00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:22,040
ago they passed Aria and so an aria is

00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:24,020
now a standard and we can't read this

00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:29,210
because it's tiny but the first rule of

00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:32,720
aria is don't use Aria if you can use a

00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:34,760
semantic element use that instead so

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,920
Aria should be a last resort it should

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,660
be the sprinkling of sugar it should not

00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,630
be the basis of making your website

00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:44,060
accessible and now that I increase the

00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:47,450
font let's decrease it again so

00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:50,450
frameworks say that they make your

00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:53,690
website accessible they do if you know

00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:56,660
what you're doing so frameworks enable

00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:59,660
accessible site creation but they don't

00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:02,750
guarantee it what you need to understand

00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,970
is the markup that you are creating if

00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:07,160
you are using frameworks like react

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,440
you're creating a component but what is

00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:13,580
the HTML that is being generated because

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,710
browsers render HTML they you know they

00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,960
also render objects of all sorts of

00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:20,120
different types but what your what your

00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,280
framework is creating is basically Dom

00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,130
nodes that the browser needs to to

00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:28,570
render you need to understand the output

00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,570
that your framework is generating

00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:34,890
another thing with using semantic HTML

00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:38,680
are not relying on frameworks is

00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:41,520
performance so Stephen wrote I remember

00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:44,560
when 3g was a primary mobile speed

00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:47,260
website was the web was slow but at

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,570
least it was usable and so now when it

00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,850
says 3g it's completely useless so

00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:58,650
what's going on is it your mobile device

00:13:51,850 --> 00:14:01,510
in 2010 if you look right here it says

00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:05,740
702 kilobytes that was your average

00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:08,610
website 702 in August on August

00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:16,000
fifteenth when I grabbed the statistics

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:22,120
we have 2463 to make that more relevant

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:25,390
I made the radius 351 percent bigger I'm

00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,580
smaller to show you the relative radius

00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:33,370
size proportionally in terms of area

00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:37,030
it's this size so if you look at the

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:39,160
sizes the distribution it's not that far

00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:41,020
off we do have a little bit more assets

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,820
but we have three and a half unlike

00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,580
proportion we have about the same but we

00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,620
have three and a half times the size and

00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:50,890
JavaScript which is right here has

00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:56,980
increased more than 350 1% we're almost

00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:58,540
at four hundred percent so the reason

00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,350
I'm harping on this is because I've

00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:04,200
worked at places where they do are gd-r

00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:06,400
gd-r and for resume driven development

00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,720
it's when you stick in every single

00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,490
framework so you can put it on your

00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:14,370
resume instead of thinking about what

00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:17,290
you're doing so problem with our DD is

00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:19,030
when you create 55,000 lines of

00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:21,490
JavaScript you have to send it down the

00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:23,200
pipes when you're on a mobile network

00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:27,370
that's really slow when you were on a

00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:31,210
device with 512 megs of ram that makes

00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:33,100
life miserable so what I'm encouraging

00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:35,320
people to do is to think outside the box

00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,350
and think about the mark-up that they're

00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,260
making so I'm going to give an example

00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:45,350
this is

00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:47,000
the visa checkout it is a form it has a

00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,590
background image that repeats and the

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,730
visa logo and that's pretty much it for

00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:55,250
v4 assets in terms of media but it has

00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:57,170
55 thousand lines of JavaScript so when

00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:00,380
I kept saying 55,000 i was actually

00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:04,310
referring to this form it takes a

00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:10,520
password an email address a check box

00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:14,150
with a submit button and a link so let's

00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:18,110
look at the performance of that it takes

00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:20,240
eight seconds to load right and don't

00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,740
content loaded takes a full almost a

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,210
half second because that's how many

00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,180
JavaScript functions are being executed

00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:31,220
and created unload it's thrashing the

00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:32,390
CPU and it has all of this time during

00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,760
which nothing is happening because

00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:39,500
that's actually when the website is

00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:41,570
being built so the website is visually

00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,570
there but it's not interactive the user

00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:47,600
can't use it for four seconds so what

00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:49,940
did I do i recreated this website that

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,070
fourteen people are working on for over

00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:54,920
a year and a half in under three weeks

00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:57,950
in a thousand lines of JavaScript a

00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:01,310
thousand lines of CSS and HTML because

00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:09,350
this is a form it should be HTML instead

00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:11,630
of 41 dependencies my performance a

00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:14,870
little under a second you can't really

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,730
tell the difference in this slide so let

00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:19,820
me show you this one where you see that

00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:24,280
I've loaded in one second and they've

00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:30,820
loaded at 3.5 at 4 seconds you see it at

00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:36,160
eight seconds its interactive and here

00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:36,160
this is my version this is their version

00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:42,820
so a few features that this has I can

00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:47,470
open this up and select a country and

00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:50,290
the icon changes I can do that well

00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:52,300
that's not really important but here

00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:54,700
there's a carousel I can click here I

00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:58,420
can right and left arrow it's all nice

00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:00,460
and good so let me show you by thinking

00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:02,920
outside the box how I reduce this from

00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:07,600
55,000 lines to 1,000 lines without it

00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:09,640
needing a framework and the point is to

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,020
just encourage you to think the point of

00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,640
these examples is to encourage you to

00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,770
think just a little bit outside the box

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,810
and say oh if I actually thought about

00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:20,020
how different ways of creating this

00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:22,450
widget then maybe I could do that so

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:28,780
here is an input massive they used and

00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:30,790
you put in the day right and it masks it

00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,960
it keeps the numbers there and it keeps

00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,910
it there in black because they're

00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,090
actually changing the value so this is

00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:43,930
an inaccessible input mask that requires

00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:50,650
the pulling in of jQuery and the plug-in

00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:52,930
so you're talking about 60 a 66 67 mkay

00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,460
of jas and they're pulling in jQuery

00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,770
just so they can use this plug-in and

00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:59,320
for the cookies and the thing with

00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:02,020
cookies as cookies is who's written a

00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,540
cookie set cookie in under five lines of

00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:07,660
JavaScript do you need a framework for

00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:09,190
that no so they're pulling in jQuery

00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,580
basically so that they can pull in this

00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:15,670
plugin so i recreated this and here it

00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:19,360
is and notice that my mask is pink and

00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:22,840
hopefully it works because yeah and so

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,880
it functions the same way i'm just

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,400
entering numbers here and here's a

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,950
canadian zip code and it accepts it

00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:34,030
actually has a title attribute which

00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:39,220
says a six character alphanumeric zip

00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:42,250
code in the format of a1 a1 a1 so it's

00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:45,970
accessible because that tool tip is for

00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:48,130
people who are cited fully accessible

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:50,000
and it says to kilobytes it's now up to

00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:53,240
three kilobytes so that's a little

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,210
but I can change it and I can make the

00:19:53,240 --> 00:20:01,640
mask a different color if I want to how

00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:03,560
did I do this I used HTML so the

00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:07,190
developer just needs to use semantic

00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:12,070
HTML a label always use a label when you

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:14,720
have a form control input type zip I

00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,010
mean type tell why did I use tell

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,220
because the zip code in the United

00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:21,200
States goes from 0 0 0 1 to 99 999 I

00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,930
don't want a little widget to go up and

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,150
down but I do want the number keypad I'm

00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:29,000
and then I have a pattern because it has

00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:31,940
to match the pattern and this is actual

00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,610
attribute in html5 and then either title

00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:38,290
attribute for site for sighted users as

00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:41,630
a tooltip how did it how does it work I

00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:44,480
have a little script that puts a shell

00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:47,600
around it puts a mask with an eye

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,970
element and the placeholder attribute

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,590
right there and as the person types in

00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:58,580
the I updates to the current value and

00:20:53,590 --> 00:21:01,250
the placeholder shrinks so the user has

00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:03,770
entered one two three and the I says one

00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:06,770
two three and then the XX is still there

00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:08,630
the eye is actually transparent it's

00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:10,310
just thinking outside the little of the

00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,840
box a little bit putting the span and

00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:14,270
making part of that span transparent and

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:18,800
that's all it was and that creates a

00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:20,240
mask so instead of using 66k I added a

00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,220
feature to make it more accessible for

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,680
sighted users and to not make it

00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:28,910
inaccessible for assistive technology

00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:30,650
users so here is the JavaScript function

00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:37,370
that basically creates that and you'll

00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:39,260
see it's pretty small and the styling is

00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:41,600
just making it invisible by using either

00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:44,960
color transparent opacity zero or

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:48,620
visibility hidden and that's it pretty

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,260
simple so a little bit about form

00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:53,690
controls to make them accessible put the

00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:56,270
label put a label with a for attribute

00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:59,000
that matches the ID of your form control

00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:00,830
if you want to sprinkle re onto it if

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,720
you want to have more than one label you

00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,190
can actually write an aria-label and

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,570
writing

00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,540
actually what you want to screen reader

00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:09,760
to read or you can use multiple labels

00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,350
by basically saying area labeled by and

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,120
pretty more than one form control but

00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,620
definitely just put the label that's all

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,260
you really need to do the other just to

00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:19,720
above it are added sugar if you forget

00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:21,130
the label it will read the play soldier

00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,720
if you forget the placeholder it will

00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,460
read the title if you forget all of

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,170
those you should not be a web developer

00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:32,380
because your site is not accessible okay

00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:34,690
so there's a failed example of it on

00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:36,790
their visa visa did use that script and

00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:39,190
the reason it's failed is because they

00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:41,560
put it into a react component and the

00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:43,510
react doesn't maintain the value so the

00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,160
excessive the screen reader basically

00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:47,700
needs to be fed the value because it's

00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,560
not native because they're using react

00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,480
so and then I don't know enough about

00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,920
react to know like what they screwed up

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,920
on because I haven't actually looked at

00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:59,500
their code so here is the carousel that

00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,030
they did and I am going to use the

00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,130
keyboard I'm going to tap into it and

00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:05,250
you see the first dot is highlighted and

00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:08,830
i'm going to use right and left arrows

00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:12,700
and this is the carousel works like it

00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:15,580
Kara so acts like a Kara so this was

00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:19,680
their version they used a button with

00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:22,240
the options with div of roll option with

00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:26,200
data carousel and all of this non

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:29,440
semantic stuff what I used was a label

00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:34,810
with a fields field set with an

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:37,360
unordered list of labels and to radio

00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:39,280
inputs or five actually I just put a

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,760
shortened version so they had this much

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,610
code I've i'm using my hands to say like

00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,920
three feet of code I've about a half a

00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:53,560
foot of code because I use semantic HTML

00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:55,090
oops including field set up here so the

00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,030
fields that will actually be read to the

00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:59,650
user will say select an address to edit

00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:01,930
and all of this is semantic and I didn't

00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:05,290
have to code any JavaScript to make this

00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:09,130
function except for one line which is

00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:12,100
set the attribute of the parent to a new

00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:15,280
class which sets the left-hand side or

00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:16,780
the transform a translated property

00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,350
that's all it's three lines of

00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:21,990
JavaScript to make that work so that's

00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:25,840
thinking a little bit of outside the box

00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:27,430
so does it is it a carousel it is a

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,470
carousel in that it has the right

00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,210
structure functionality there is

00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,800
animation that's controllable and all

00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:37,030
the content is available to all the

00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:39,870
users the interesting thing is it is not

00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:42,460
a carousel I cannot Carol it a carousel

00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:45,820
because people who actually use cars

00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:47,680
carousel screen readers will say but

00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,050
wait this thing works I have all the

00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,970
information that I want I didn't need to

00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:53,560
actually use JavaScript to say the page

00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,960
has been updated because if you use a

00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:58,240
car so you have to update the page when

00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,950
it whenever it's updated and tell the

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,280
user the screen reader user this has

00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:05,610
been updated the version that I have

00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:09,340
it's just an unordered list of elements

00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:11,980
it's a it's just an unordered list of

00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:14,730
radio buttons with a label it's all

00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:17,260
there so I called it merry-go-round

00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:20,560
which is basically a carousel but with a

00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:25,060
different name so there's a there's a

00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:27,190
repo for it a github repo at marry at my

00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:29,200
github but it's really just three lines

00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:32,380
of jas so it's weird to have a github

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,550
repo repo for three lines of jas so I'm

00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:38,820
going to cover one more thing which is

00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:41,140
this this country selector right here

00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:43,420
and the country's electric doesn't

00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:46,180
actually have a repo because it uses no

00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:49,470
JavaScript so this was a veces version

00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:53,260
and it uses sections and divide us a

00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:57,280
section roll option tab index blah blah

00:25:53,260 --> 00:26:01,660
blah blah blah blah blah again it's an

00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:03,070
unordered list of countries you select

00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,680
the radio button that matches the

00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:08,620
country and all it does is change the

00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:13,930
class to checked I mean the CSS changes

00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:16,540
it to two input colon checked is true

00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:18,100
and that's how i style it so there's no

00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:20,590
lines of JavaScript in this so I

00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:23,530
couldn't actually create our repo but

00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:25,330
I'm going to create a repo nothing fancy

00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:31,360
in the CSS

00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:34,640
I just the only thing that's fancy is

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,590
the footer that it was in scales open

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,690
and close when you change so there is

00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,430
one line of CSS JavaScript for this

00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:43,150
example which opens and closes the

00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:45,940
footer on change and that's all it does

00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:48,650
so what is the point of all of this oh

00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:51,620
forgot to say one thing I should use

00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:54,920
some examples of semantic HTML replacing

00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:57,230
Aria right I just use semantic HTML it

00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:01,460
works everyone under screen readers will

00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:03,050
understand it when you do need it Aria

00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:06,170
does exist so I'm not saying don't use

00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:09,920
Aria I'm saying think outside the box

00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:12,800
and use Aria when it's necessary so

00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:16,880
instead of using the new shiny resume

00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:19,790
filler think outside the box because as

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,880
web developers these are the features

00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:24,590
that we actually need to know and that

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,320
are hard to learn and that take years to

00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:29,690
master and these are not the things that

00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,820
I find on red on job descriptions when I

00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:33,740
see a job description I see five years

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:37,850
of react even the reacts been around for

00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:40,280
like two and a half years but the

00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:42,940
fundamentals of HTML that is really

00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:45,170
really important the fundamentals of CSS

00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,520
understanding the Cascade understanding

00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,050
the inheritance it's really not that

00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,810
difficult but it's something a lot of

00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:51,920
people have never really thought about

00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:54,160
knowing that JavaScript fundamentals

00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,780
which enable you to understand what your

00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,910
framework is doing and then everything

00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:01,820
on this side on the right side

00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:04,190
progressive enhancement all these

00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:06,260
features worked and the entire deck

00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:09,770
works if there's no JavaScript or CSS

00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:12,380
that comes out understanding

00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:14,960
accessibility performance security these

00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:17,450
take a long time to learn and they're

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,370
not the focus of the hack reactors

00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:21,800
necessarily they might be that would be

00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:23,660
a great pack reactor so when you put out

00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,250
a job description include everything on

00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,320
the right realizing that people can

00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:29,480
always learn a framework but

00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:32,840
understanding what their framework is

00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,610
producing is a real untrue skill that I

00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,280
think that's why we're at the conference

00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:38,710
so that we can all get those skills so

00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,770
thank you very much

00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,770
