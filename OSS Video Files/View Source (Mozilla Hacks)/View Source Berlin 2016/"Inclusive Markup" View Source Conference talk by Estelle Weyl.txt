Title: "Inclusive Markup" View Source Conference talk by Estelle Weyl
Publication date: 2016-10-03
Playlist: View Source Berlin 2016
Description: 
	Accessibility is the law and a good idea. Let's make the Web accessible and fast for everyone. We'll skip "why" and focus on "how." Accessibility can be as simple as using the right semantic elements in your HTML. Semantic HTML can prevent bugs, improve performance, reduce code bloat, and make your site accessible to screen readers and keyboard users. We'll explores accessibility features native to semantic elements, adding a sprinkling of ARIA roles and attributes. Form controls, input masking, styleable selects, and carousels with a few lines of CSS, fewer lines of JS and no frameworks.
