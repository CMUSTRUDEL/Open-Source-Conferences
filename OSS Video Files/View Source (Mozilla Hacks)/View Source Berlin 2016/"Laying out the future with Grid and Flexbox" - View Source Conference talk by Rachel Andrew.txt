Publication date: 2016-10-03
Playlist: View Source Berlin 2016
Description: 
	It is 2016. CSS is now 20 years old, and it has taken this long for us to get a true layout system designed for web pages and applications. A layout system, not based on hacking properties designed for something else entirely, but one that considers the reality of design for the web today.

In this talk I’ll introduce this new layout system, a system encompassing Flexbox, CSS Grid Layout and the Box Alignment Module. We’ll take a look at the mindset shift needed to really take advantage of these modules, and also consider what they mean in terms of accessibility and performance.
