Publication date: 2016-10-03
Playlist: View Source Berlin 2016
Description: 
	As front end developers, we own performance. As designers, we own typography. So how do you handle the tricky intersection of beautiful web typography and performant web pages? I'll be showing the audience OpenType features, explaining why they're important to typefaces, and explaining the tradeoffs they have on performance. We'll go over how to enable OpenType features and how you can optimize your font files for the web whether you own them and serve them up through @font-face or through Typekit so you can feel confident serving up gorgeous typography on your sites.
