can you hear me

00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:12,600
awesome thank you yes so influential and

00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,879
from Bremen Germany and today I would

00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,359
like to talk a bit about MDM browser

00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:22,230
compatibility data for the last eight

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:27,450
years or so I'm working on MDM ambien is

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:32,039
Mozilla developer demos little dog it's

00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:41,760
probably what's that closer to the mic

00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:48,140
all right let's see like like this maybe

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:50,820
no all right where was I

00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:54,270
good all right

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,360
so NBN is a documentation site where a

00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,219
few tech writers and a large community

00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:02,420
tries to document the web and that means

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,759
we will we are writing about HTML CSS

00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:10,430
JavaScript HTTP and basically all the

00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:10,430
technologies that the browser runs and

00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:18,420
we do this in a wiki form on developer

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,909
at Mozilla dark and last year we were

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,650
after a long time also for it with the

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:27,900
price by slash data where they said okay

00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,909
ambien is a really great site in terms

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,830
of developer satisfaction so it means

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,040
that you guys probably like the stuff

00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:37,110
that we are writing about and we've

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,840
actually did a lot of work over the last

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,689
13 years when this content was first

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:47,460
open source so this is how it actually

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:50,909
started like a classic wiki in 2005 it

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:53,579
was based on media wiki Mitchell Baker

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,650
was able in 2005 to take a few of the

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,150
netscape contents where technical

00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:00,240
writers from netscape brought about

00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:04,710
javascript and open source that into a

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,570
wiki and this was the layout in 2005 but

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:10,079
basically all the Muslim people of has

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,569
put on all the stuff that they developed

00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:16,349
about all the technologies they have

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:21,359
vented like JavaScript and support when

00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:24,569
I joined the team in 2010 or less to to

00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:27,090
write about what technology mdn was

00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:29,849
actually drastically changing from being

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,609
like a wiki where everyone was dumping

00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:36,810
content into something we're a small

00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:39,750
team of passionate web developers that

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:43,469
were really also hired by all the html5

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:47,849
and css3 technologies that came up to

00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:50,430
trade a documentation up for open web

00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:53,400
technologies so the scope was kind of

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:56,609
narrowed down from everyone dumps all

00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,090
the contents on mdn on the developer

00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:03,980
Center - let's make a coherent website

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:06,419
where we document web technologies and

00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,760
during the last year we have even

00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:12,599
changed a bit more the layout of the

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,060
site so for example this is something

00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:18,479
that recently landed and it is a bit

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,340
also inspired from w3 schools that's the

00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:24,060
site that everyone is told you don't use

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:26,579
it use MTN because well we're having the

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:30,120
more correct content but but w3 schools

00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:33,329
does a very good is delivering you know

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,400
quick sample code quite fast and easy

00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:37,379
and we're trying to address this with

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,419
our new interactive editor that we've

00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:45,269
put on the top of pages and generally

00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:47,040
there's two types of developers test a

00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:48,870
constant driven ones that really like to

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,780
read a lot of content and understand the

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,970
concepts behind a CSS property or method

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,769
but then there's also the ones to just

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,379
want to perform an action the action of

00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:00,930
developers and they really want to do

00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:05,639
one thing and that is copy paste code

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:08,639
and this is happen with that but today I

00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,650
want to focus on one particular project

00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,120
of the mdn team which is about

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,250
compatibility

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,340
and compatibility is not only important

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,739
for mdn but also for Mozilla we want to

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,410
encourage everyone to use a variety of

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:25,020
browsers and not only write website for

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,419
one browser which is to be the IE

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:31,169
problem which now probably turns into

00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:33,000
the chrome problems and on env and what

00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:35,370
we've we've done so far is we've

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,160
provided these kind of tables I guess a

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:41,160
lot of you have seen does this is a

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,199
table that displays compatibility

00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:47,610
information about the CSS background

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:50,190
property you can also see if you sub

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,750
features of that same property like

00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:55,020
multiple backgrounds and as treat each

00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,870
image images as a background and it we

00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,729
used to have this table in the wiki for

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:03,450
like I don't know five six seven years

00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:05,639
now and if you've ever edited mdn which

00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,380
is by the way easy as just signing up an

00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:11,100
account and you can edit it's a wiki R

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:14,039
so everyone is able to edit and change

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:17,550
things on mdn and this is how it looks

00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:22,200
like or looked like when editing these

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:24,870
compatibles this is a static HTML table

00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,789
where you know the versions and you know

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:31,490
little helpers that we wrote around

00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:34,410
those versions this is how it was stored

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,599
now there's a there's a lot of problems

00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:39,240
with this so imagine this that's a table

00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:40,820
being on all of the mdn reference pages

00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,580
that we have and we're talking about

00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:47,970
maybe 10,000 pages there's I don't know

00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:51,060
400 CSS properties there's like an

00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,440
amazing amount of api's and HTTP headers

00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,020
and all that and all these pages had

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,210
static information in there about

00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:01,080
compatibility so we couldn't mass edit

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:03,360
the data we couldn't mass at data we

00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,590
couldn't reuse the data like convert

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,210
data is something many people are

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,940
interested in but it's kind of locked in

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,560
our wiki in those tables and when we

00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,340
want to change this we have to go into

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,789
all the pages and and change stuff we

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:20,060
can also not validate data so as I just

00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:23,960
said everyone can edit MDF

00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:25,460
and put a say Firefox 6.3 version for

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:30,010
the CSS background property which is

00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:33,169
nonsense as firefox 3.6.13 ever existed

00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:35,419
and because of the nature of the wiki

00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:38,080
which in the empty we are also

00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:42,050
considering rethinking at the moment

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,510
everyone can just change things without

00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,340
any further discussion which is which is

00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:48,290
a problem when talking about you know

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,540
factual information like compatibility

00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,820
there's not actually a opinion around

00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,590
this it's just it has started to work in

00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,600
this version or it has not and it's

00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:59,479
another version or it's not supported at

00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,520
all we can also have no automation here

00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:03,770
like we could probably write some

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,260
scripts using sauce labs or browser

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,750
stick automatically generating

00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:13,340
information on when something was

00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:15,910
supported and finally the mdn team is

00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:20,150
largely or the ambien website is largely

00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:21,710
sponsored by a mozilla and we are we

00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,500
have a few employees including me

00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:27,620
working on the side but we want to

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,479
encourage and invite the other browser

00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,810
vendors as well to document with us

00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:35,750
together the open web and we've

00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:39,380
addressed a few of these points the last

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:43,520
one for example in October last year in

00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:46,400
October 2017 mozilla we reached out over

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,039
the last year to a few other industry

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:53,360
leaders naming the Microsoft Google the

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:55,400
w3c and Samsung and and they now form

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,400
with us together the product advisory

00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:01,400
board for MDM what this means is that

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,160
all these companies are now helping us

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,130
to document the web because we we're all

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,840
doing things on the web we all like the

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:11,360
Microsoft and Google they are building

00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,039
browsers the w3c creates the standards

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,950
that we are also documenting on amnion

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:19,400
finally after few years we came together

00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:20,750
and and formed this board and this will

00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,030
this will help us

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:27,200
with the whole documentation and also

00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:29,690
with the with the combat data and then

00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,300
what we what we finally also came up

00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:34,460
with is we want to we want to get out

00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,140
the company data out of the wiki when

00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,120
you can up liberate its break it free

00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,140
from the aesthetic tables into a

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,190
repository so what we came up with is

00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:46,370
repository that you can find on github

00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:49,720
it's get up to thumbs /m DN / browser

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:52,580
compare data and what we did there is we

00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,440
start all this data that we what we have

00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,080
in our reference pages in a structure

00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,120
that looks very much like this so on the

00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,390
left hand side you can see like the

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,240
folder for CSS properties so stuff like

00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:07,610
align itself or animation of backdrop

00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:11,090
filter and in each of those files you

00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:12,980
have a Jason structure where you have to

00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,930
you know some inter fires saying that

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,750
hey this is a CSS property it's the

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,850
background property you can also you

00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:22,670
have a back reference to the MVNO URL

00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:27,100
and then there's a support object for

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:27,100
the various browsers and diversions and

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,250
we also provide this as an NPM package

00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,400
as it is just JavaScript or JSON data so

00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:40,430
you can reuse this and nodejs as well

00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,290
and then access it like it is shown here

00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:46,420
and you will get back to the D Jason

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:49,880
that is stored in our comfort store and

00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:52,220
know when when editing mdn it's it's a

00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,770
lot simpler because we don't have to you

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:57,170
know we don't have to edit every page

00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:59,750
anymore we can just mass edit in our

00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:01,640
github repository and on our pages can

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:06,050
call a query like this and get the data

00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:07,940
from the data store and thanks to this

00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:11,150
we were able to recently redesign those

00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:15,230
tables also so we got rid of the tab

00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:17,750
switching from mobile to and desktop to

00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,940
show all role and other mobile desktop

00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,920
browsers at the same time because many

00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,260
of the web developers should you know

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,210
having mobile first approaches and the

00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,950
mobile data is as important as well

00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:31,830
we've added node.js to the tables to

00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,150
because well it's not JavaScript it's

00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:36,420
not only in the brows anymore but to

00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:39,000
test no chairs and so we kind of did

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:43,680
this redesign like I think it was last

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,840
week on me and you know very a lot of

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,720
the pages are now showing up with with

00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:52,470
these redesigned tables and the good

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,960
thing is the French pages used to have

00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:57,420
the static tables as well so in our old

00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:00,120
world it could have been that the French

00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,980
version had some but said some comfort

00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,690
information the English page had some

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,970
comfort information that it always liked

00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,910
different information and all across the

00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,440
wiki which was terrible and now the

00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,720
French version can also just call in to

00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:18,600
the data store and display localized

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:20,940
comfortable so this is what what mdn is

00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,590
done to kind of set free this data so

00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,790
yes we are open-source already our

00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,790
content is open-source

00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,590
but the comfort information was still

00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:32,160
kind of locked in in the static tables

00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:35,520
now that is set free it's open data and

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,430
you can reuse it so if any of you has a

00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:41,490
project or is interested in writing

00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:43,920
plug-ins for atoms supplying vias code

00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:46,380
or if anyone is you know for me I was

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,980
writing bars on github you could imagine

00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:52,740
you know using this data to write

00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,480
helpers for your project to check

00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,360
against compatibility because the data

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,890
has a lot of information on what is

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:04,620
supported in which version of the

00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:07,020
browsers so a mozillian called Eduardo

00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,720
boosts us Heat he did something useful

00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:12,060
with this data and you can use this

00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,860
maybe for inspiration on this is dev

00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,470
tools so I put steps tools and he has

00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:19,590
written an extension adding a new tab

00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:22,260
called compatibility and what it does is

00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:24,630
it analyzes the CSS files of your

00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,940
website and gives you information on

00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:31,110
what kind of properties you have used

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:33,630
and it will display you you know similar

00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,850
like comfort metrics inside dev tools

00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:38,000
saying okay you've used this on that

00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:40,339
property and it doesn't work in I

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,800
so you will not be compatible and a

00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:44,800
percent there with with i9 for example

00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:50,000
so let's have a little bit of a look now

00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:52,189
that you hopefully feel a bit inspired

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,339
of what you could do with this data said

00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:57,769
what's what's in the data right so for

00:12:55,339 --> 00:13:00,110
now we're still not completely finished

00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:02,389
in migration from this static table

00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:04,490
thing into the data store about like

00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:08,000
forty five percent done but right now

00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:11,149
what we have is is a mixture of this

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,420
so there's CSS HTML HTTP javascript and

00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:16,189
web extensions compare data in there and

00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:19,459
this already gives you a bit of a sense

00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:21,680
of how large these technologies are so

00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:25,160
web extensions has a lot of API so there

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,470
are a lot of data points here same for

00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:30,769
CSS all the properties to selectors at

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:32,660
rules and so forth HTTP is a bit smaller

00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:36,949
because we mostly have competative for

00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:38,899
HTTP headers in here now I've looked a

00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:42,470
little bit deeper into the data for CSS

00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:45,139
and if you are into I don't know

00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:47,149
data science these things you could also

00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:50,089
you know analyze this data set and and

00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:52,730
you know look at how CSS develops over

00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:56,300
time so for example when we had Firefox

00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:59,899
10 Firefox 110 years ago there were like

00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:02,809
90 CSS properties and because this data

00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:05,509
has all the others discover data source

00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:07,100
all the Firefox versions and and I've

00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:09,230
looked into it when there was little

00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,899
spikes so in Firefox 16 for example

00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,759
there were a lot of new CSS properties

00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:16,069
and I was like what's what's going on

00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,930
there so it turns out they implemented

00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:22,699
CSS animations back then or later

00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:24,949
flexbox or over the last like fifty or

00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:26,930
sixty five boxed versions CSS but more

00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:29,839
complex complex adding more features

00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:31,309
over time so I'm and this was like I

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,050
couldn't you know make this child-only

00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:36,610
out of our data which was kind of

00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,610
interesting I thought of these

00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:42,060
one thing I need to mention though is

00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:44,339
that the data is as we have just started

00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,350
to migrate them we have not yet polished

00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:49,050
and more validated a lot what's in there

00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:52,410
so the chart that you've just seen about

00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:54,630
the CSS data I was using the Firefox

00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:56,490
versions because our data is actually

00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:59,370
most complete for Firefox because on the

00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:01,860
wiki well we used to maintain the data

00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:04,050
for Firefox mostly and not so much for

00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:07,260
other browsers so what you can see here

00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:09,300
is a lot of the data is either the

00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:13,140
version is unknown or the D

00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:16,250
compatibilities unknown at all so but as

00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:18,660
as it is open data I can only you know

00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,339
have a call to action here you can help

00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,800
us making this data more awesome which

00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:24,300
will make the tables displayed on mdn

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,370
more awesome which will make the two of

00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,160
the NATO out of Road and f2 is awesome

00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:31,310
which will make the tool that some of

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:37,470
you may come up with more awesome so

00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:39,899
yeah that is that and with that that was

00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,050
browser combat data open data brought to

00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:43,490
you by the md n team thank you

00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:46,690
[Applause]

00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,690
[Music]

00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:57,460
any questions yes yes I know that

00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:09,170
yes so we look into can I use Kananga

00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:11,150
says about 300 features listed on the

00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:14,900
page and that's awesome it's a it's a

00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:16,640
wonderful site our dataset is it's a lot

00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,340
bigger and we're not even done yet

00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,720
so yes we're working together with Kenna

00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:23,270
use and there might be some

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,890
collaboration in the future but right

00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,750
now the data that we want to set free

00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:29,450
from the wiki is just a lot more richer

00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,220
about 10 to 20 times more richer and we

00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,690
want to preserve that information and so

00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,930
as the first step we're putting that

00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:40,930
into a repository and but yeah

00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:40,930
future collaboration awesome let's do it

00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,810
right

00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:53,380
right so the thing that's the things

00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,330
that oh yeah sorry

00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,940
so the question is about collaboration

00:16:55,330 --> 00:17:01,240
between can I use and and this data set

00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:05,950
and you know competing or you know

00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:07,750
double effort and the thing is this data

00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,700
set is a lot more richer because we have

00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,130
all the information from over six

00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:14,320
thousand ambien wiki pages and can I use

00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,660
this only about 300 pages listed at the

00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,450
moment and Bob's most projects are kind

00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:22,660
of relying on also on on you know manual

00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:24,520
pull requests updating the data but we

00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,830
want to bring in here is who want to

00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,080
kind of have official status using our

00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:31,540
partners from the mbn product advisory

00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,610
board putting in official version

00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,770
numbers when something is supported and

00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:38,520
also adding on top of the data some

00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:41,200
validation and automation you know that

00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:44,260
actually tells us the truth whether or

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,870
not something is supported but yeah I'm

00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:51,630
open to collaboration with can I use as

00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:51,630
well and yeah sure

00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:00,310
more questions

00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:03,619
No all right Dan thank you

00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:03,619
[Applause]

00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:08,839
