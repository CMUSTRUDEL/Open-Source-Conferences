	00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:13,809
hi speaking Italian don't like panic on

00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:13,809
pizza just to be sure okay let's start

00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:19,460
there is the Dodge Fox of fire dodge

00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:21,680
started in a serious talk just to start

00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,599
with the good mood because is one of the

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,310
most famous things when there was

00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:28,250
released by post one too many people

00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,869
want to keep to use this icon there are

00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,700
two wallpaper like this case so you can

00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:35,870
find on the internet if you want

00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:37,850
so next start fixing what Alex said

00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,770
about me I want to do a little bit in

00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,739
the production just to say that I am a

00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:45,920
developer like probably many of in this

00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:49,010
room so I don't know many people there

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,530
was the last year about following not

00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,800
distort but similar about webOS nation

00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:57,559
how many there was the last year but

00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:03,050
once you tree okay so how many have

00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:05,930
their JavaScript developers oh okay big

00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:07,670
alpha dorm so when you come back at all

00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,560
after the first M you can develop on

00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:12,830
station without issue and now we

00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,280
discover why it's so easy John back to

00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,479
me

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,820
I am evolved in different offices

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,340
project and the from the fun part that

00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,870
have my first extension let's a

00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,820
development was for the WordPress

00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,310
community to add them to improve the

00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,200
translation process in the website so it

00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,660
started with something that I was

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,510
needing another community with another

00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:34,730
community so extension lets you to

00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,970
improve the user experience also of

00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:41,210
websites that are not yours

00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:42,920
so I think that as Firefox user probably

00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,100
there in this room I don't know and I

00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,620
want to know but as browser users this

00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,510
problem is true we know that in the case

00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:53,660
of Firefox Firefox is famous for the

00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:56,360
extensions and in the long life of

00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,640
Firefox there was a lot of extensions

00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,010
like in this example Firebug I think

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,230
that all the JavaScript developer use at

00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:06,080
once at least because there wasn't

00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:08,239
initially these kind of tools

00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,759
the answer was running after Internet

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,730
Explorer 6 so was something oh my god

00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:15,800
yes but now we have perfect developer

00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,090
tools in turbidity the browser but then

00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,099
we are about secession manager

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,980
integrated the browser - we have the

00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:22,890
top-grossing

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,200
something cooler there in this that

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,390
period but one of the most interesting

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,849
things is the spy lot I don't know many

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,940
people know about Firefox the spy lot

00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:36,209
but is very important why because in

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,310
Mozilla they add on ecosystem is very

00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:40,830
important because Mozilla itself use the

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,290
technology to improve our user

00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,480
experience so it's not so on the develop

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,579
an API and don't use it no they use it

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,310
so they improve it because they need it

00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:53,849
so for a developer means that we are

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,319
using something that works and any

00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:56,879
something partner for a developer

00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:01,079
because we are we have we don't have

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,670
time to waste in something so that even

00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:05,250
this point of view we know that what

00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,530
Zilla use there dunce api to release in

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,739
fact of system add-ons like description

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:15,480
tool that started as firefox test pilot

00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:17,430
and if you want to see other experiment

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,180
go to the website and install on your

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:23,489
firefox new experiments and one of the

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,669
most important things now that you can

00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:28,799
also develop developer tools for firefox

00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:31,139
that use the same API in the of chrome

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,970
for the chrome developer tools and you

00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:35,010
can extend answer developer tools this

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:38,160
is something for a developer amazing

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:40,680
because developer usually there'll of

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,530
tools to develop better so it's like an

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,900
exception but is very important for us

00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:48,359
another point that we are to enforce the

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,310
fact that in mozilla advanced a very

00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:52,049
important is the marketplace as

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,950
developer we know that this important

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:58,680
web users to see if our work is good or

00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,959
not in mozilla the code name is emma

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,049
that is not hammer in italian is the

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,930
word for law but we are is adorned

00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:09,239
marketplace just to be sure and these

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:13,590
are official statistics about the last

00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:17,190
year of the project so let's start with

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:20,519
few numbers we have that half of the

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:22,199
Firefox user at least has an add-ons so

00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,970
means that we have probably a

00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:30,530
marketplace with a lot of users

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:34,560
next point actually in the camel we have

00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:38,670
26,000 adults and I can say again a lot

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:42,060
of adults and we have also a lot of

00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:45,230
developers 9000 developers but another

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:49,980
point is very important is the 12

00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:52,620
million monthly users on Elmo let's

00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:55,890
again it's very more a lot I don't know

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,210
it but a lot a lot and this means that

00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,460
when we are working releasing an

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,620
extension we can reach a huge number of

00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,920
users but be customers because there are

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,650
a lot of services that do extensions too

00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:09,840
so with these facts we can think that

00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:15,330
right now that what we are doing

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:17,520
probably someone will use it so these

00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,320
are example of my most famous escapes um

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,410
so it's always better to start with real

00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,330
cases is a social share extension that

00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:29,610
implement the tissue removal with

00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:32,370
Firefox 57 as you can see there this is

00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:37,680
I release this tension in September now

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:38,610
as these users and I am NOT a beast I

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,180
don't have a business

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:44,340
so I only uploaded on em oh I don't know

00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:50,460
many people cannot understand why there

00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:53,670
is this huge peak in the statistics yes

00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:56,130
exactly in 14 of November there was the

00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:59,190
release of Firefox 57 and there is a new

00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:04,110
tool about 57 tests suggest to user to

00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:06,420
try a dot so a lot of new users in one

00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,980
day but that's in the next week and it

00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,690
is funny and so this part because many

00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:13,260
people don't understand why every week

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:15,750
there is peak and off-peak another peak

00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,670
along peak because usually people on the

00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,770
weekend that don't use Firefox because

00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,060
maybe they have to work or they have a

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,310
family so they don't use the computer

00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:27,210
the not all of the people is an air that

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:30,210
work and all the week so we have that

00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:33,270
Firefox to know how many users as an

00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:36,360
extension they resent the pinger too

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,430
heimo to say whether these are user as

00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,010
this extension at especial there are new

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,830
versions so in that way mozilla track in

00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:45,840
anonymous way of course the downloads

00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:49,920
and these are the statistics inside

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:53,100
inside the hammer porta income these not

00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:55,320
exist so but I'm gonna say that because

00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,230
I want zillions Excel but these two

00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,760
doesn't exist they also the interface is

00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:02,220
the most horrible things that you can

00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,990
see in the web is the chrome marketplace

00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,290
in the backend is the most horrible

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:12,060
things that you can see now but is true

00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:14,780
it's not me you is a issue then exploit

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:19,500
is that last year I started with these

00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:21,660
quote in another way I say Firefox today

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,390
is the most customizable browser that's

00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,580
exists but after the release of Firefox

00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:30,570
57 I don't know many people saw or read

00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:33,270
it blog post Twitter many people was not

00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:35,820
happy about the application of many

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,310
things so many people will say I cannot

00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:41,070
use my love Alice tension that I'm using

00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:43,860
science forever because it's not the

00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:45,600
relevant anymore or this API is not

00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,600
supported so many people was good

00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:51,450
getting back to a previous release

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:55,170
complaining somewhere so the question

00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:56,640
now is for users as a sphere users fight

00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:00,990
for Steve to be the most customizable

00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:03,500
browser actually yes and now we will see

00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,500
why

00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:11,640
ok we need to start about thinking that

00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:13,460
sulig sitcom our diet this the old

00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,980
technology doesn't exist anymore for

00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,750
developers that was boring complicated

00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:21,420
difficult to understand now we have the

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:24,270
new technology that is as a parody with

00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:26,700
chrome despite a big patch we finally

00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,990
with opera of course different relevant

00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,060
Asia because Firefox is most

00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,680
customizable we have out to the multi

00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,750
process of part on windows been a

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,320
different process working progress also

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,880
feel for the operative systems we have

00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,800
the support on package for Android

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,140
Firefox for Android is the only browser

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,910
on mobile the support extension so you

00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:49,490
can have a block origin as an example on

00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:52,800
your Firefox so today we have this and

00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:54,900
this is an extend screenshot of indian

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,520
documentation about all the hapy i there

00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:01,710
are now available a lot of things and it

00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,530
is not enough because i want to show you

00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:07,500
the most cool API that we have right now

00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:10,260
container started as firefox test pilot

00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,090
project now is integrated in your

00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,070
browser

00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:16,980
what is the container api is something

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:19,410
pretty is useful to shower session

00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,090
between a group of tubs in few words and

00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:25,410
you have an api to integrate it in your

00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:27,240
extensions next we have the paycheck

00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,700
show I want to show a button in the

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,160
address bar that you can develop when to

00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,200
show and the open a model I want to show

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,540
you an example again this is my

00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,810
socialist engine pretty simple is Anna

00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,700
frame we do something and you can use

00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,890
all the JavaScript API and a bright as

00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,380
you prefer

00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:48,180
we have also one of the most Oscar

00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,470
things and the Internet's I can do an

00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,750
extension that communicate another

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:53,580
distinction yes you can do it there is

00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:57,600
an API that enabled

00:09:53,580 --> 00:10:00,000
then we have also the way to change the

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,160
new tab on page with something else the

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,350
difference is this cases on Chrome that

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,240
is different because reporters of bucum

00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,130
are industry but in Firefox doesn't

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,459
exist a page for that so it's not

00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:13,089
supported

00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:15,649
we have another way to use for house

00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:19,489
authentication from Firefox so we don't

00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:22,160
need to use a library because it's as an

00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:24,829
example this amazing extension that led

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,350
little you to access real time to

00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:29,449
notification on github automatically do

00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,739
the authentication with Firefox so for a

00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:33,949
developer is very easy to do

00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:35,959
authentication this one is the most most

00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:37,819
interesting things because you can have

00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:40,549
a binary on the computer that

00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:43,369
communicate with your browser in a

00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:45,739
privacy way we can say that is a JSON

00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:48,679
the application is a binary on your

00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:52,189
computer and we have the web browser

00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:54,290
that communicate in that way these are

00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:56,779
an example all part of us understand

00:10:54,290 --> 00:11:00,499
what is the the binary what extension

00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:02,839
can access and the JavaScript code it's

00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:04,819
pretty easy for us to do an extension

00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:07,660
that do that and want to show you a few

00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:09,949
example this is me on my cup the

00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:14,089
environment that communicate with my

00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:15,799
phone inside Firefox is an extension the

00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:18,230
results are keepers extension as an

00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:21,410
example for possible manager there is an

00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:24,769
extension that's enabled the MIDI API in

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:26,959
Firefox so you can find many of them we

00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:29,929
have also support for Quint review and

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:32,480
riddle mode API if you want it have to

00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:33,709
run because the time is not so much but

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,319
is very funny I don't know many people

00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:38,269
know doom they've done a fork that when

00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:41,689
you kill a monster killer process we

00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:43,850
have a patient that killed tops because

00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:45,649
the API enable to ask to do it not so

00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:50,509
these kind of attacks and is an

00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:53,089
extension is a a bunch of HTM HTML CSS

00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:55,669
and JavaScript stuff all together we

00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:57,649
have the indycar the displaying the data

00:11:55,669 --> 00:12:00,350
and what extension can do like

00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:02,689
permissions the files that have to run

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:05,839
called the scripts you can define the

00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:08,569
pattern the file to load etc inside the

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,169
manifest next we have the background

00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:10,879
scripts

00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:14,389
these are scripts that communicate

00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:16,910
behind your tabs your developer tools as

00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:18,319
an example because there is a sandbox

00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,120
you cannot have an extension that run

00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:20,950
everywhere

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,510
you have an extension that you can run

00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,940
everywhere communicating between

00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:28,480
different fights so background scripts

00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:30,880
are pretty useful we have contact page

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,070
that is one of the most users as an I

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,529
think that everyone there as a tally is

00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,850
an extension that improved github

00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:39,130
usually is a Java skill injected in a

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:42,190
page and this birth Dec to do an

00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:43,900
extension like that we have the browser

00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,210
action that is again his lack of each

00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:50,770
action but is a button that is always on

00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:52,450
the browser UI and me about so a list to

00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,420
define a little cool on the manifest

00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:57,430
about the fact that extension can access

00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,260
so not the extension cannot I said all

00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,839
the file on the computer only the part

00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:05,380
that we define in this manifest so it's

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,060
safety for the users another point was

00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,910
the last year was the review on Emma

00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,410
because was manual so when we have to

00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,240
release a new version at so maybe about

00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,550
fixed we have to wait someone that

00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,350
review the code and quite a lot of time

00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:20,110
that in the web is something not

00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:22,740
acceptable now is automatically for

00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:25,390
specific kind of API is manual to again

00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:28,510
but it's very fast to have a new release

00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:30,520
and be very happy about this work

00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,440
because was one of the most problem for

00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,660
me was the de chrome is automatically

00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,020
they doesn't care about anything about

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:40,450
strict code policy lint in the second

00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,250
about energy in Mozilla and their mo you

00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:45,010
have a lot of warning about what your

00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:47,410
coat doing wrong so he said before so to

00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:51,220
developers to see that this code is bad

00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:53,980
can be better and it is a lot of things

00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,150
that we have in fact ox 57 perfect 58

00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:59,350
per fox59

00:13:55,150 --> 00:14:01,150
and try to do it as one slide recap of

00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,610
the most cool things that you can see as

00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,900
an example the sidebar because Fox is

00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,490
the only one that they can have a site

00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,910
where you can get an extension that use

00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:12,820
the sidebar you have as an example

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:16,150
now you can embed the web extension

00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:19,089
experiment with an extension again the

00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:21,010
result so what says one of the most

00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:23,440
asking things was to add back the

00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:25,390
vertical management for the tabs now

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,010
there is the VI in Firefox 59 that

00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:31,130
enables developers to hide the clothes

00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:33,110
then toss so there is a lot of working

00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,640
and the best way is to check the dogs

00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:38,300
blog to see what are the most cool API

00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:40,880
that are coming and these are so there

00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:43,130
are examples because developer had a lot

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,390
of things to do and now we add 45

00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:49,970
example of complete extensions available

00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:51,650
documented on MDM and when you are

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,540
opening an API you will find an

00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:55,900
extension that using this API so you can

00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,490
see the code working inside your browser

00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:01,340
complete everything documented last year

00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,660
was not that way now we have that the

00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,790
conditioning one of the most things

00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:08,390
boring to do for a developer but someone

00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:12,050
has to do it for us so how you can try

00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:13,760
this page about double dot debugging

00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,340
enabled to you to the bagger to the

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,560
extension inside Firefox and what also

00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:21,560
your development extension using this

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,050
button so it's pretty easy download the

00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:28,100
extension open and automatically style a

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:31,820
temporary until you close Firefox next

00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:33,740
we have a tool for command line for

00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:37,090
people that love command like how many

00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,860
loggers drop the command line there

00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:40,460
there is a tool that enable to do a lot

00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,700
of things

00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:45,770
signed extension linking watch low

00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:49,820
distinction of Firefox for Android a lot

00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:52,910
of things in a tool so there is the UI

00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:55,340
way common language it's your choice to

00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,380
do an extension I've no not so speak

00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,800
because as I said Chrome marketplace is

00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:02,330
horrible you cannot have a graph about

00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,150
the statistics or dollars add on a

00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:07,100
script that scrape this data and cross

00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:09,530
this data so with Firefox you can see

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:12,860
what is the best browser for you for

00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:15,680
your extension and now we about an

00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,990
interface on mo this is the adhan

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,440
developer hub with few extensions that I

00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:24,380
made without so new logo graphic

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,720
etc and we have also the new have own

00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:30,200
interface as we have our stickers asked

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,300
to us with the new octopus mascot that

00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,060
is more mobile friendly and there are

00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,610
add more easy to find sections I like it

00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,950
a lot is that before and it works of

00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:42,240
course also provide better than before

00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:44,040
there is that's a website for people

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,200
they say ok after this Chrome extension

00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,270
works with Firefox probably yes you can

00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,430
applaud there automatically will say ok

00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:52,740
it's working or not so pretty easy for

00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:54,890
us to check out so easy to load inside

00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,570
Firefox as an example the KDE connect

00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:59,640
extension add the support on Firefox

00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:01,800
because I open at the ticket the next

00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,199
day was on the marketplace because he

00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,280
has only to upload on the marketplace so

00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,400
it's pretty easy to have to then

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,439
essentially from Chrome or Firefox there

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,209
is not a standard in progress yes they

00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:15,270
are working we know that what you see is

00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:18,089
very slow they are working

00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:20,429
we got update on this course they are

00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:22,410
starting working again after path of 67

00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:25,650
because was like stop that because

00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:27,510
complaint was busy and now they're

00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,220
starting working again honest and I

00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,559
think about it a standard to develop

00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,100
extension for all the browsers if

00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:38,190
something that I think 10 years ago was

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:39,630
C Phi I think probably yes and I want to

00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,340
give you to you few links very

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:43,950
interesting this course this our

00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,750
category is a forum with all the staff

00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:48,150
all the project in Mozilla is doing you

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,610
can find common voice but ceiling etc

00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,500
there is a section for development at

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,929
dawn so you have questions you can write

00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,490
there so everyone will app you so it

00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:59,160
also you can reach developers from

00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,650
Mozilla etc and there are also other

00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,360
links of course the advanced blog is one

00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:07,320
of the most important research is to get

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:11,850
updated about what's going on and now

00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:14,730
it's time for questions so I have to run

00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,540
but there was a lot of things by Fox 57

00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,809
is pretty cool

00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,809
yes

00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:36,820
actually there are different I think

00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:39,159
personally there are work there are

00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,379
different API working but it's better to

00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,029
say about web experiments they are

00:18:41,379 --> 00:18:44,649
trying but there is Jordi probably has

00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:46,360
more information about the planning

00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:47,799
because for a mozillian you have to

00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,049
check out all the bugs ela tickets is

00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:52,059
something complicated to do there is the

00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:55,509
blog and dance you can check the new

00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:58,299
release and personally I think that a

00:18:55,509 --> 00:19:00,759
new implementation to change the browser

00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:02,289
setting from an extension are very

00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:04,179
interesting because you can do an

00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:06,070
extension that interact more strongly

00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:08,320
with privacy settings in Firefox as an

00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:11,049
example than before and I think add to

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,029
the tab the tab hiding API was one of

00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,799
the most requested with Firefox 57

00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:17,590
because there was a lot of user that was

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,419
using the vertical system for tops so

00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:21,070
personally these are for me the most

00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:22,869
cool for the hand of the app in idea

00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:25,749
what are the plan but there are a lot of

00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:32,159
things to do to cover the gap without

00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:32,159
previous API there are other questions

00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,690
ok so I expect that when you come back

00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,940
after the first M you will develop an

00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:42,009
extension of course and release for us

00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,389
because we are users and we need the

00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:45,580
essential to improve our experience

00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:47,670
pretty easily with the button to stop

00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:57,890
understand so thank you for your time

00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:57,890
