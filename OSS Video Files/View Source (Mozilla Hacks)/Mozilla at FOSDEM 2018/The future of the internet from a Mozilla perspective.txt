	00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,470
you know it's a

00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,150
a path from today into the future and

00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,280
it's not really clear what that path

00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:19,130
looks like but of course we have some

00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,930
hopes and some dreams I think just as

00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,060
all of us did when we started an open

00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,310
source and so today I want to talk a

00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,170
little bit about thinking about the

00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:30,740
future both from the internet and the

00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:35,390
web and free software so in the future

00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:37,550
it's clear floss is everywhere floss is

00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,190
everywhere today and this is really

00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:43,970
quite remarkable you know in the early

00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:48,949
days of mozilla floss was sort of

00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:51,080
radical and really sort of everyone who

00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:54,170
wasn't involved in it knew that floss

00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,300
was some odd thing that maybe developers

00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,489
did but that really wouldn't have impact

00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:02,120
and there would always be small and sort

00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:03,949
of developer II like and in the United

00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,280
States we were called socialists and on

00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:09,290
American and such things so false

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,060
everywhere today seems maybe obvious

00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:14,509
when you think about it but certainly

00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:16,880
was not at the time and so I think a few

00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:19,460
things have gone into that one you know

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,500
the right idea at the right time to a

00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:26,149
deep need for real collaborative work

00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:29,810
and development and three the early very

00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:32,539
early work of license plus community has

00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:35,600
also been a model and so not only is

00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:38,329
Foss everywhere today but the open part

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,700
of it is everywhere from open source and

00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:42,950
open standards where we started to open

00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,159
data open government open science

00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:48,829
citizen science and so some of these

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,280
core ideas from floss through the work

00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:54,079
of these groups us actually has become

00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,299
much more mainstream and has moved even

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,399
out of floss not always in the free

00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:00,289
software moniker but certainly in the

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,630
open moniker and that's a really

00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:06,710
exceptional piece to have accomplished

00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:08,270
in 20 years or so and sometimes there's

00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:11,630
a

00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,560
the cost of success so today meet github

00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,900
is obvious

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,400
it doesn't necessarily carry all the

00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,620
values or the thoughts are the things

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,300
that go into foster care for some it

00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,280
does for some it doesn't it's just the

00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,840
way of working and so there are many

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,040
things about floss that are mainstream

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:32,170
today which is wild success and also

00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:36,200
means that there's still more to do

00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:39,320
because you know while floss is

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:44,510
everywhere closed systems are everywhere

00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:46,580
- and so floss software soft cloth

00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,640
libraries floss developers and

00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:52,940
communities have gotten much stronger

00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,160
but in the Internet today are really

00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,560
encased and wrapped in and often

00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:00,740
developed to the general consumer inside

00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,890
a deeply closed system and so we can see

00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,930
do you think about the online life not

00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,180
so much of developing but of actually

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,900
engaging with activities and the human

00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,810
experience

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:15,380
despite the layers of floss it's really

00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:18,530
a small number of closed systems and so

00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:21,350
on its own sort of without interest

00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,870
without us without the other activists

00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,640
for freedom and openness and choice you

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,800
can imagine that these closed systems

00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,500
the human experience on the Internet

00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,690
for most consumers will continue for

00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,820
quite a while sooner or later they may

00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,830
decay or some new technology or new

00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:39,140
business model might come along but

00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:42,050
that's not apparent in you know the next

00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:47,180
few years and so the questions of floss

00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:49,760
and what we can do does our work in our

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:53,060
projects here affect the internet affect

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,740
the experience and if so might we tune

00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,020
our work our thinking to have more

00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,270
impact and so of course that's the

00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:02,260
intersection that Mozilla lives in I

00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:05,480
mean born out of floss communities

00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:08,120
standing on the shoulders of giants but

00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:12,050
also very focused on the end

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,959
and so the use of floss software and

00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:17,540
user control and choice and safe and

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,850
secure software in our case really aimed

00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:22,250
at online life both the structure of the

00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,889
network itself and the human experience

00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,169
and so for this question of you know the

00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:29,240
future of the Internet I want to frame

00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:34,880
it today in three questions and three

00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:37,340
responses so the first one how do values

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,010
that bill floss or build free software

00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,860
and open-source communities how can they

00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:44,720
get built or expanded and modified and

00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,660
really built into the fabric of the

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,000
Internet more we see them in the

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,160
development methodology of much of the

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,780
software in the internet but we don't

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,200
see nearly as much in the human

00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,910
experience and so one question is what

00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,370
might that look like what might we do

00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,660
what are we doing today if there are

00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,580
many of us thinking about these

00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:09,080
questions how do we join together and

00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:12,860
become more effective you know second

00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,990
question will the future be webby now

00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:19,220
for those of us certainly have a certain

00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:21,680
vintage we came online to the web or the

00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,470
world wide web and the Internet underlay

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,070
it but the graphical user face and the

00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:31,010
ability to navigate and to move easily

00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:32,240
outside a command line was the web and

00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:36,620
there are certain things about the web

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,780
that made it powerful and that reflected

00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:42,169
many of the aspirations of flossed

00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:44,270
software now today many people don't

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:46,460
know much of the web and certainly if

00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,440
you come online for the first time on a

00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:51,110
phone and in

00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,880
the environments in the world you may

00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,410
not actually know about the web actually

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,410
mostly what many people know about is

00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,520
Facebook so that distinguishing

00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:00,590
differences between Facebook and the

00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,420
Internet are unclear but then when you

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,310
try to get to the web or what do we mean

00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,950
about the web or the link or hypertext

00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,510
that's another stage altogether and so

00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,100
I'm not a believer it's the

00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,380
responsibility of those billions of

00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,480
people to understand what the web is and

00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,660
why it's different I'm a believer that

00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,820
as technologists and projects people

00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,820
interested in this part of the world

00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:25,580
it's really ours to make it clear what

00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,840
is great it was great about the web

00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,200
what's great about the internet and

00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:32,300
where freedom lips like you can have

00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,600
protocols that have more or less freedom

00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,880
and openness built into them you can

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,590
have technology that's the same way and

00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,290
you can have apps and human experience

00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:44,750
that provide a better foundation for

00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:47,570
more freedoms for more people and so

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,610
this question of will it be webby is not

00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:52,580
a question of whether people will talk

00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,260
about the web but it's a question of how

00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:59,390
much freedom is actually built in there

00:06:54,260 --> 00:07:02,030
and so we use the link or I do you know

00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:08,000
as as one very clear example of what

00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:10,669
that means i I see many technologists

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,400
cringe when I say this but but I view

00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:19,100
the link as a distributed simple

00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:23,360
mass-market data structure where any

00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:26,090
human being can take the knowledge the

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,460
wealth of knowledge available online at

00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,740
least in a webby format online and we

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,720
can make our own narratives through that

00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,760
and we can make a path through different

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,730
kinds of data different formats from

00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:40,850
text to video to voice to a RvR in the

00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:42,919
future without having a to go to someone

00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,660
and ask permission without having to

00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:47,200
learn

00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:49,750
underlying technologies and so the web

00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,670
was linkable in a two-way fashion you

00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,290
know if the information was out there on

00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:55,900
a server connected to the right

00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:57,850
protocols you could get to it and from

00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,860
there you can get out of it back into

00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,960
someplace else and so it wasn't

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:04,900
systematized into these closed lock

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,570
systems so the web is linkable the web

00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,100
is interoperable and the web is set up

00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,460
in a way that there's a piece of

00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:15,130
software out there that represents you

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:17,650
not the website not the publisher that's

00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:20,740
got content not whoever owns the server

00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:23,140
but you and that's the browser and

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,150
that's why we build the browser I mean

00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,550
we love the browser Mozilla you know and

00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:32,289
we love Firefox we love the browser me

00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:34,330
too but but we love it at its heart

00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:37,030
because it is the tool that can

00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:40,270
represent each one of us and and this

00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:42,010
arcane piece of software can can

00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:45,010
represent me a visa via web site

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:47,580
anything from as simple as I want all

00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:50,650
the text bigger on every website I go to

00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:53,200
to I don't want to see your ads and your

00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:55,300
trackers can't follow me and so this

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,540
question of who represents you or who

00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:01,150
represents me in an online experience is

00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,430
an open question when we get outside of

00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:06,130
the old world wide web and the browser

00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,630
and so sometimes people ask Mozilla well

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:10,570
why are you so interested in the browser

00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:13,150
and that's the reason because that's our

00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:16,660
model to date of how we represent you

00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:19,240
and how we might build a stronger and

00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:23,260
more powerful place for you to exercise

00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:25,810
freedoms in your online experience and

00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:28,270
yes moving outside of the desktop

00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:31,570
browser into the other areas or the

00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:33,220
modes that we use is important to us and

00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,690
but the browser continues to be

00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,510
important I mean it's very cool and it's

00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:41,140
it's amazingly complex technology and we

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:43,300
understand it but the other root of why

00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,490
we continue to be deeply focused on it

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,740
as it is the model it's no longer the

00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,900
universal client that it used to be but

00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,600
it is the model for how we take freedom

00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:57,990
and openness and start to put them in

00:09:52,600 --> 00:10:02,740
the hands of consumers in some much more

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:06,190
easy-to-use fashion so question 2 still

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:08,440
quite open and you know in the 1990s

00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:10,810
when we went through this the first time

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,420
there was a set of activity that turned

00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:15,670
out to be illegal tying the operating

00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:21,130
system into the browser blocking out

00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:26,200
competition sets of rules so that was

00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:31,620
nice and the EU was a leader in this and

00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,620
this was true in the US as well so

00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:38,380
that's not the case today

00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,060
you know today all of the things that

00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,270
were illegal because they were bad for

00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,580
competition bad for choice allowed will

00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:47,410
say monopolies are near millat not

00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:50,680
monopoly control stifled innovation

00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:52,450
today they're all legal but Apple

00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:57,810
started the system Apple had very small

00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:59,589
market share but now Google does this

00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,660
Microsoft does it again

00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:04,330
you know the edge browser will reset

00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:06,460
your default browser almost every time

00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,140
it updates so it seems so there's

00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,560
there's a range of activities that were

00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:14,740
clearly wrong in the first go-round with

00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,540
the web and today whether they're wrong

00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,820
or not is one thing but they're not

00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:22,230
illegal as they were and so that means

00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:26,230
there there is a lot of work to do and

00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:27,940
the interest in the closed systems is

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,640
much more now in the closed system level

00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:33,330
there's growing concern about especially

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,610
in Europe you know Google Apple Facebook

00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:38,470
George Soros you know this week made the

00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,450
connection between the size and scope of

00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:42,700
these closed platforms and the loss of

00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,430
innovation and business opportunity so I

00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,140
think awareness as can

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:48,089
but we're back in us in a setting where

00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,220
the things that we knew were

00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:52,380
demonstrably bad for all of us in

00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,519
society are all quite legal and they're

00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:57,000
the norm once again

00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:00,810
so lots of work to keep keep on there

00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,970
and the third question how do we tackle

00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:08,640
the new experiences that are clear about

00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:10,760
the Internet today we have known for a

00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,050
long time that surveillance is a problem

00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,089
so I don't think of that as a new one

00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,250
it's an issue that continues and maybe

00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:19,079
gets worse now that we have sort of

00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:22,380
commercial advertising based

00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:23,700
surveillance that we participate in but

00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,040
there's a whole new set of issues that

00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,459
have become very clear in the last few

00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,700
years

00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:31,500
it turns out just having all the

00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,500
information of the world at your

00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,200
fingertips doesn't mean everybody

00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,910
searches knowledge more it turns out

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,440
that we're all online doesn't

00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,260
necessarily bring us closer together

00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,209
that there's a lot of devices you know

00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,339
it turns out that the differences in

00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:50,970
communities don't go away

00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:54,800
and class and status and gender and

00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:58,829
ethnic issues show up in in many ways

00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,800
unmonitored online and so that's a good

00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:03,720
size set of issues and it's easy to look

00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,699
around and say wow you know the thing

00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,810
that we really loved the internet the

00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:12,750
web it's got a lot of problems now and

00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:14,880
that's certainly true and many of those

00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,829
problems as best I can figure it out

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:21,000
come from the fact that the early

00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:23,850
internet architecture was designed by

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,570
people of generally the same perspective

00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,740
a they're all trying to work together

00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:30,660
they were trying to make something that

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,240
was interoperable they were trying to

00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:35,610
build technology and they were trying to

00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,649
build a community and they were very

00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,089
clear about the social engineering and

00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:41,449
the nature of community that they were

00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:43,400
building and they were wildly successful

00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:46,310
we have the Internet today

00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:50,450
taken eating everything but they were

00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:54,050
not among themselves fighting they were

00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:58,490
not playing out ethnic racial gender

00:13:54,050 --> 00:14:00,350
political religious differences among

00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:02,030
them in the things that they were doing

00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:05,390
and so the system that was designed

00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:07,460
works great and it doesn't yet have

00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:09,350
mechanisms in it for when all of

00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,320
humanity is involved and all of our

00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:14,330
differences show up there's a fair

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,580
amount of freedom of activity and not

00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,260
the same kinds of I would say

00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,960
community-based accountability

00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:24,590
mechanisms and so you see people free

00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:27,050
feeling quite free you know to to say

00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:30,610
and do really horrendous Thanks

00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:37,040
so yeah how does start with a happy talk

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:38,180
okay so three questions and so one of

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,460
the things that we're trying to do what

00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:42,920
mozilla is to try to answer some of

00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:45,140
these questions not to have the only

00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,060
answers but to be part of the set of

00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:50,030
people who are actively trying to engage

00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:53,720
with this amazing thing the web now the

00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:58,460
internet that can connect us in so many

00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:01,370
ways and needs attention so what how are

00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,230
we thinking about it well Pat one the

00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:06,350
starting point

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:08,990
you know floss freedom and openness and

00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:11,060
collaborative development and what we're

00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:13,580
increasingly learning about communities

00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,950
and building healthy and increasingly

00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:19,760
diverse communities it's a range of

00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:21,710
values that certainly falls down

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,740
demonstrates how deep and how far and

00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:27,290
how wide they appeal to people and how

00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,270
you apply them in different ways and

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,769
every year there's new projects applying

00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,360
these in places and

00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:35,029
you never would have thought of so

00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:40,279
there's something in the set of values

00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:43,850
that build this community and we don't

00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:47,779
quite have a way to express those values

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:49,939
in data because floss software

00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:51,619
especially the really powerful software

00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:54,290
sits at the heart of a lot of data

00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:56,660
systems you name it Amazon Google

00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:58,399
Facebook right but but we don't actually

00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:02,299
address the questions of openness and

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,649
freedom in data in a cohesive way and

00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:05,540
that makes sense you know it took a

00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:08,389
while for the free software definition

00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:11,269
to be developed it took a while for the

00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:14,480
entire new system to be developed you

00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:16,429
know many many years to develop each of

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,499
the components that ended up in Linux

00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:20,449
and so is not surprising that when we

00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:23,600
get outside of pure software and we get

00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:26,509
into other areas that we don't have the

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,179
consensus or the cohesion about what is

00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:31,489
open data how do you protect freedom how

00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:36,049
do you protect individuals so that's an

00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:37,790
area of real focus and at mozilla in

00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:40,490
particular we have wrenched ourselves

00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:42,379
around into dealing with data because

00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:45,170
our approach for many years is we don't

00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:47,929
want any data then we never have to

00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:50,420
think about any data and it allows us to

00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:52,279
have a whole range of privacy and

00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,809
security practices and to stay out of a

00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:56,299
lot of problems because we have no data

00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:58,519
well turns out a it's very hard to build

00:16:56,299 --> 00:17:00,230
a decent product and there she's in

00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:04,010
quantum is so much better as we finally

00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:06,020
understand it but on a deeper level our

00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:08,360
mission to try and make the Internet

00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:11,120
open and accessible to all and a global

00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:14,260
public recent resource and a decent

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,819
place to live requires dealing with data

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,829
data is everywhere now and it's powerful

00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:21,620
it's explosive and it's powerful so

00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:23,930
we're looking into it and hoping

00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,600
to find and connect with others in the

00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:29,150
floss world who are interested and/or

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:32,540
already developing certain principles

00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,290
about data same thing about cloud

00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,780
services

00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:39,970
you know since floss is triggered on

00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:43,070
distribution the requirements of

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:47,080
copyleft don't really apply to the large

00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:49,190
cloud services and so we don't have a

00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,380
you know we don't have our values deep

00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:53,809
in those systems so what does that mean

00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:56,780
this has been you know a contentious

00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:59,630
topic certainly philosophical from RMS

00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:01,160
from way back so maybe we will always

00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,550
have the same view that if you're not

00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:08,000
distributing a copy of the code that

00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:10,220
copyleft isn't acceptable and that

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,080
therefore cloud services go off on their

00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,910
own but I certainly would like as a

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,830
community to meet to think about it and

00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:18,830
look at that pretty carefully and see if

00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:21,740
that's the full sum of our thinking on

00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:23,570
those things and finally the experience

00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,740
which is data that by this I mean the

00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:27,830
human experience

00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:32,230
which is these closed system pieces what

00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:34,340
what can we should we be doing and so

00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:36,830
you know there are many of you that are

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,870
more involved in some of these areas or

00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,960
have been involved productively longer

00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:43,429
than Mozilla house and so I and I and I

00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,380
think a bunch of no zillions who are

00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:47,840
here are pretty interested in learning

00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:50,450
and hearing what your experiences are

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,940
and I think you will see Mozilla engage

00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:54,740
more deeply on these sort of topics as

00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,750
we go forward and they are hard

00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:01,010
questions data and privacy and security

00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:03,410
are hard to manage but I feel that the

00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:05,090
mission requires it and it in some ways

00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,400
it feels pure to say we're never going

00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:09,590
to have data because then we never make

00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,960
a mistake with data but I think it's so

00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:13,520
a little taking the easy way out and I

00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,170
think the state of the world doesn't

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,080
allow us to take the easy way out

00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:20,630
so I also am sure we will make some

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,850
mistakes with data like I wish we could

00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,929
be perfect but we don't or we won't

00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,550
we're only human

00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:28,250
so you will see us make some mistakes

00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:30,410
with data and I ask in that case

00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:37,610
you know let us know call us on it but

00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:38,810
please try to be gentle as well it is

00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,730
one thing that drives me crazy in

00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:43,310
Silicon Valley where people will just

00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:45,170
feel free to haul in and tell Mozilla

00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:47,450
just how terrible we are while they work

00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:49,910
at Google and are doing these like more

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,200
invasive things and then wave their

00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:53,390
hands and say oh but you're a nonprofit

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,970
you're supposed to be better like that

00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:58,940
frees them to go off and be really nasty

00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:01,880
people so let's not do that to each

00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,850
other if we can will the future be webby

00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,680
I sure hope so

00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:08,810
because the ability to have something

00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,060
represent me in the world is really key

00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:13,250
that needs interoperability it needs

00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:16,070
competition these are a few of the

00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:18,230
things that Mozilla is doing here these

00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:20,960
are the technology side like will the

00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:23,150
future be webby has a technology side it

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,940
has a community side and it has a system

00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:28,160
architecture level side that last piece

00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:31,130
is hard to crack in the mobile space on

00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,930
telephones I mean because that's it

00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,700
that's an ecosystem that's you know 10

00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:37,130
years old and pretty entrenched we're

00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:40,240
not done trying but in the mean time and

00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:42,650
so you can see that the deep voice

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,070
essentially open-source library for

00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:49,190
voice but you know those those may

00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:51,350
become system tools but we also you know

00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:54,110
continue to explore various technologies

00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:57,710
that otherwise we think would end up

00:20:54,110 --> 00:21:00,800
living only in the silos of the

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:02,540
proprietary organizations so we continue

00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,910
to work on this and of course to look

00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,950
around always both when we're here and

00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:09,860
increasingly in general and see who else

00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:11,720
is working on that and can we can

00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,190
Mozilla do the things that we see but

00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,800
can we better be better at supporting

00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:17,720
the community of people doing others so

00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:21,230
I hope you see these projects and find

00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:23,060
them interesting but I also hope that we

00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:26,240
see you and what you're doing and get

00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:28,490
better at supporting and on the third

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,560
one this one's really tough because

00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:34,100
those new issues get you right straight

00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:36,110
into well who decides is it daxing you

00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,380
know is it really violence do you get to

00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,300
talk about X is that

00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,220
censorship who decides what about free

00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:44,220
speech and so those are really hard

00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,710
problems and we certainly are big

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,990
believers in individual action and free

00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:51,720
speech and yet the Internet experience

00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:54,750
as it is today is not acceptable so we

00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,610
can't do nothing and so where we are so

00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:59,850
far you know Mozilla has a manifesto

00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:01,560
that's what guides us that's what we the

00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,210
set of principles that Mozilla is about

00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:06,660
that we hope anyone who cares about

00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:09,960
those can relate to and so we have begun

00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:12,540
adding some aspirations to them they're

00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,190
not hard core principles yet because we

00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:18,030
don't know how to strike the balance

00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:19,890
between human community activity that

00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:21,660
some behavior is not acceptable and what

00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:24,720
does accountability look like with free

00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:26,640
speech and freedom and individuals being

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,860
responsible for themselves those are

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,050
very hard so we're not saying this is

00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:33,420
the way life has to be but we want

00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:35,520
clearly to set out some aspirations for

00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,800
the world we're building I do not want

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,390
to build a web or an internet that is

00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,730
good for government and commercial

00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:45,780
stalkers and violence and hatred and

00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:49,130
divisive misinformed beings trying to do

00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:52,500
Tisa things so we have a few additional

00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:54,510
aspirations and I'll just let you read

00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,690
them here and then I'm going to close on

00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,690
that

00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,780
and so those are actually in a public

00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:18,460
Google group but probably the URL isn't

00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,860
well known so you will see the start to

00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:23,530
come out in more easy to find places in

00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:25,630
the next couple weeks and again we

00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:27,160
realize you know individual control and

00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:29,530
freedom and government censorship are

00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,540
real issues so happy to engage on that

00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:32,610
but if you can be gentle I'd appreciate

00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,590
it

00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:38,020
and and obviously the hope is that we

00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:41,650
have floss everywhere as we go forward

00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:43,770
but in more open systems generally thank

00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,770
you

00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:04,130
