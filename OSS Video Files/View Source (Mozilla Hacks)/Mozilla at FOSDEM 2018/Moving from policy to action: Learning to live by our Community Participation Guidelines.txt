	00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,990
thank you

00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,680
hi this is my first FOSDEM and I'm

00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,480
having such a good time can you hear me

00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,250
okay awesome

00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:24,650
um I'm Larissa you wanna just did a

00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,869
great job of introducing me she's right

00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:30,770
I am a former developer and product

00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:33,130
manager I worked on many things but the

00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:36,200
open source projects you would know are

00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:39,860
buying the name server software is C

00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:44,300
DHCP open Solaris and then Mozilla

00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:48,050
project used to be a Perl hacker hacked

00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:51,289
a lot of Perl long ago so other things

00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:55,760
about me which are may be interesting

00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:58,550
I'm a mom I'm 45 don't have a technical

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,800
degree I'm from California English is my

00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,690
first language I attempt Spanish and I

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,540
attempt German in French but if you come

00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,770
at me too fast I won't understand you

00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,200
I'm pointing those things out not so

00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,120
much because they're relevant to the

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,500
content of the top of the relevant to

00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,159
Who I am and they're elements of

00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,780
diversity right I'm also a queer woman

00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:20,420
what else not there's a lot of things

00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,590
about me that are me that are part of

00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,479
who I am and they're part of what I

00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,430
bring to work into my community

00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:26,720
contributions right and all of you have

00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,130
lots of things about you that are

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,259
relevant to your work into your

00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,759
community contributions and the best

00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:33,110
environments for us are the ones where

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,250
we can bring all those things and not

00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:38,360
have fear about that so that is what

00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:43,009
we're gonna get around to talking about

00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:44,630
it some things we might cover I'm gonna

00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:46,280
talk to these loads but I'm also going

00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,590
faster than I would have because it's a

00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,409
half an hour or not an hour took a

00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,000
little bit about our CPG is a quick way

00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:56,329
of writing community participation

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,820
guidelines a little bit about why we

00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:01,219
changed them because we went through a

00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:04,039
big process of changing them what we

00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:05,570
have learned through changing them in

00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:07,549
case you might want to change ORS or you

00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,440
might want to learn from our mistakes or

00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:10,880
you're part of our community and you're

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,880
curious any of those things

00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:16,400
just a side note I love questions there

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,710
are no wrong or stupid questions with me

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,000
ever and you can ask them any time just

00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,150
put your hand way up because there's a

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,680
lot of you

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:30,090
okay so feel free to interrupt me it's

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:32,970
okay so this is something that Mitchell

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:35,069
said about why we have our community

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:40,310
participation guidelines I like people

00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:40,310
to read it I'll let you read it

00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,160
basically

00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:57,770
if our mission as Mozilla is to make the

00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:00,800
internet a global public resource open

00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:04,340
and accessible to all we need to be a

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,080
community made up of the diversity of

00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,180
the world and we need to be a community

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,160
and a product welcoming of the diversity

00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:15,230
of the world and to do that we need to

00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:17,810
have ways that we work together that we

00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:20,030
know how to work together okay so I'm

00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,360
gonna have you answer questions if you

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,730
want

00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,800
I have t-shirts they look like this they

00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,180
are this t-shirt I will give you one

00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,790
after this out there so that we don't

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,980
interrupt the next talk if you want to

00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:33,110
answer any of these questions and you

00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,670
don't have to be right just like there's

00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:38,260
no stupid questions there are no wrong

00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:42,980
answers there are just different answers

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:45,790
anybody or I can answer them all the

00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:49,269
t-shirts will be mine

00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:52,299
it's okay if you don't want to I'm gonna

00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:53,439
start and people can jump in so what are

00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,870
the community participation guidelines

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,879
we talked about that but basically they

00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,799
are Mozilla's code of conduct for how we

00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:01,840
treat each other are the behaviors that

00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,650
we expect and their behaviors that we do

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,420
not think are acceptable and they are

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:11,349
applied everywhere that mozillian czar

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:13,690
together when did we make them I believe

00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:16,539
it's eight years ago the first version

00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:18,190
and what's changed about the guidelines

00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:19,359
and why I'm gonna get into in my

00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,489
presentations that we learned to worry

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,460
about that why do we need them at all

00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:28,449
well we talked about that and I would

00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:30,130
say because in order for us to feel safe

00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:31,810
bringing our whole selves into a project

00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:34,510
we need to know that that's not going to

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,940
cause us a problem or a barrier and also

00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,320
that if you're a person who is in some

00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,120
way substantially different than the

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,560
other people already in the project you

00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,900
need to know that you're specifically

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,970
welcome not just that people are welcome

00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:50,949
but that you are welcome that's really

00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:53,099
important anyway I'm going to keep going

00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:53,099
because

00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:04,190
so I like to highlight this slide

00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:06,560
because it's sort of why we have the

00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,720
guidelines right we need to have a

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,590
baseline shared understanding for how we

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,990
treat each other and a process for what

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:17,419
to do when that doesn't work out if we

00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,160
don't have that then we don't know

00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:21,979
what's expected of us and we don't know

00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,810
what to do when things go wrong which

00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:29,960
happens more often than we would like to

00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:33,410
think all right a few statistics about

00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:36,530
more about the why and there's three

00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:40,460
here first one is based on an EU study

00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:42,740
about inappropriate behavior and it's a

00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,990
workplace statistic but I think in many

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:48,110
ways open-source is like a workplace and

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:51,169
this in this regard so 14% of people in

00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:53,659
the EU report problematic behavior and

00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:55,190
20% of Mazzilli UNS have reported

00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:57,650
something happening online that they

00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:59,800
found inappropriate and that was a

00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:02,150
Mozilla staff statistic but it's also

00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:06,080
seems to be being borne out in community

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:08,509
research and also relevant is that these

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,699
kinds of situations often shift who feel

00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:12,860
safe to participate and that may be one

00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:15,770
reason why only 11% of open-source

00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,509
community participants are women there

00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,729
are lots of other diversity demographic

00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:22,490
statistics we could go into that's not

00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:24,199
really the theme motifs talk but I love

00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,949
to talk about it someone wants to find

00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:29,840
me at lunch tomorrow

00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:32,900
feel free okay so one of the things I

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:37,070
want to talk about is like how and why

00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:38,889
we changed our process so we created our

00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:43,190
community participation guidelines and

00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:46,960
they were much like an event could have

00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:49,849
conduct but a little more general and

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,130
they were not necessarily extremely

00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:55,159
specific about the different groups of

00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:58,009
people and communities and attributes of

00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:59,160
people that they protect or what would

00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:01,440
happen if something

00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,360
went wrong right it was more general

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,400
than that and over time we got a lot of

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,980
feedback from people as well as I would

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,320
say the entire culture around these

00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,870
types of documents shifted and has moved

00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,000
forward and so we decided we needed to

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:18,270
do a revision and I tried there to map

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,560
out what we did but basically we got a

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:24,870
lot of feedback then we also did two

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,850
different substantive diversity and

00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:33,540
inclusion research projects one broad

00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:35,130
broad project with a more more involving

00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,990
Mozilla stuff and the second one being

00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,880
very specifically community focused and

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,620
in both cases we got a lot of

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,140
information that people didn't know what

00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,330
the guidelines were or what they were

00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,070
expecting them to do or how to make a

00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,810
report of a problem or what would happen

00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:51,300
if they did or whether the guidelines

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:53,370
applied see were protected them so we

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:58,920
were like well this is a problem right

00:07:53,370 --> 00:08:01,770
so we started a revision and we did some

00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,540
community forums where we met with lots

00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:07,560
of folks and asked people what they

00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:09,450
needed we gave a revised version a

00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,180
period of comment or we put it on a lot

00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:14,550
of different Mozilla discourse and other

00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:19,440
forums public blog posts etc to get

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:22,919
feedback we got a lot of feedback we

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,560
incorporated a lot of feedback we then

00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:28,020
revise the guidelines with a team and

00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,650
with Mozilla leadership so what we ended

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,360
up with involves directly editorial work

00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,099
by our most senior leadership which i

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,130
think is important for any project that

00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:40,200
your that your leadership team your your

00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,240
whatever that group of people is really

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,650
support and buy-in to whatever you come

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,890
up with as guidelines because otherwise

00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:48,540
when things go sideways they may not

00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:52,590
feel strong about backing you and you

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,880
really want that and then we re-release

00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:58,380
the guidelines and I'll go over the

00:08:53,880 --> 00:09:00,180
content of them in a second but we also

00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,460
very much consider them a living

00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,950
document and that people can recommend

00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,990
change

00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:09,460
or effectively make a pull request and

00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:11,830
submit a patch right anytime and in fact

00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:14,560
there's one place in here where I tell

00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:17,350
us has something because it's something

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:21,550
that we're really into grating in right

00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:23,920
now based on someone's contribution so

00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:27,640
what's in the guide lens anyway does

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,650
anyone have any questions yet all right

00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,900
I'm gonna talk about what's in there and

00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,100
then a little bit about what you might

00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,520
want to do if you have your own

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,690
guidelines or you're trying to make them

00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,480
I'm gonna go quickly there's a lot of

00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,830
stuff here but also I put the slides on

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,710
the FOSDEM page and I'll send them to

00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:48,160
anyone who needs them this is the first

00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,900
two paragraphs of the guidelines I like

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,910
to share them separate from talking

00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,890
about the more sort of bulleted list

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,840
sections because I think they get into

00:09:53,890 --> 00:10:00,400
the spirit of why we have it and what it

00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:03,400
really means we really want to recognize

00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:06,100
appreciate and respect the diversity of

00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,410
our global contributors everyone who

00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,610
engages with mozilla in any way and all

00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:15,970
of the different things that we are

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:17,440
right and we expect agreement and

00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:21,550
adherence to the guidelines from

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,350
everyone who's involved right so that we

00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:26,170
can have a safe and positive experience

00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,610
and that is important enough to

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,920
emphasize many times and I would

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:33,010
encourage those of you who organize

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,170
Mozilla's stuff to make this that clear

00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:36,880
to your communities I find it has

00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:42,040
nothing but a positive benefit when we

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:44,650
do lots of words here but the high level

00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,710
the TLDR of this is that any place that

00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:49,420
you are representing mozilla or in a

00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,390
mozilla space or engaging with mozilla

00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:55,120
ins or doing the thing that you have

00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:56,470
mozilla attached to you you are covered

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,870
by the guidelines and so are the other

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,490
people there so like one of the things

00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,660
people don't always think about is if

00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,250
you're at a conference that's not a

00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,960
mozilla conference but you're

00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,390
representing mozilla and something

00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,890
happens to you that's really not awesome

00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,660
then you feel violates the guidelines

00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:13,000
the other person is not necess

00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,500
mozillian we will still try to help you

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,450
and we will talk to the conference and

00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,930
do our best to advocate with you because

00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:24,040
you are there as a resilient right

00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:25,330
for example basically if you're not sure

00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,390
whether a situation is covered by the

00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:30,610
guidelines it probably is um you know

00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:32,980
the long list of diversity dimensions

00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:35,200
and then you'll notice the nice Firefox

00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,420
Orange any other dimensions not listed

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,830
comment that means if it turns out that

00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,910
in your community there's a huge war

00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,990
between the people that wear the blue

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,390
socks and the people that wear the

00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:45,490
orange socks and someone insults someone

00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:48,250
else based on their stock choices still

00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:51,520
in the guidelines right we just don't

00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:58,270
take our commentary to personal

00:11:51,520 --> 00:12:00,790
attributes we don't and also there's a

00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:02,790
lot of things here that are specifically

00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,870
described in English that may not be

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,310
described in the same way in your native

00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,660
language and maybe aren't clear and

00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,670
that's what I mean when I say there's no

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,650
stupid questions if you want to ask me

00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:14,740
later like what does that mean I don't

00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:16,230
understand it's really okay I'm happy to

00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,630
talk about it whatever it is

00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:24,820
and I mean that sometimes people don't

00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:26,260
think I mean it there you go and

00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,210
sometimes there are also dimensions of

00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,950
diversity that are really important in a

00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:32,680
specific cultural context that aren't

00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:35,980
listed because either we were unaware of

00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,600
them or they're really important to a

00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,490
small group of people as opposed to the

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:45,520
broader global community they're still

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:47,150
they're still covered okay there we go

00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,330
so

00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:52,970
these are like the the titles of for

00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:54,650
long paragraphs in the actual text of

00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,660
the guidelines which is on mozilla.org

00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:59,270
and there's a link to it in the slides

00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,140
but also if you just use your favorite

00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,030
search engine

00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:05,240
DuckDuckGo community participation

00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:08,120
guidelines you will find them the four

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,740
things that we really expect from

00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,480
mozillian xand which I believe are

00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:17,780
really important in general for all of

00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:18,730
us are to be respectful hopefully I

00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:21,110
don't need to explain what that means

00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:22,670
being direct but professional and

00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,410
professional is a little bit of a funky

00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:27,920
word in the context of volunteerism but

00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:30,830
I would say what we mean there is it's

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,110
really ok to have conflicts it's really

00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:35,180
okay to disagree but we need to do it in

00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:37,400
a way where we really let the other

00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,700
person know but in a respectful manner

00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:43,220
right and then listen to them and have

00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:46,540
even a heated argument just without

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,540
devolving into personal attacks

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,650
appreciating and accommodating

00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,520
similarities and differences I think the

00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:55,580
really important thing here is

00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,530
accommodating and like within Mozilla

00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:00,200
one of the things that comes up a lot

00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:05,120
here is thinking about other people's

00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:06,600
language or timezone or food it was too

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,770
dark

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:13,720
Thanks yeah it's getting back outside

00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:15,730
and I were really jet-lagged so if I

00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,460
don't notice like you know meteors

00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,060
coming at us that's because I'm I'm from

00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:24,850
California

00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:29,830
oh it was just like nothing all right

00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:32,020
thanks for that so um and there's more

00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,490
detailed examples on the and again in

00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,260
the full version but also I think

00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:37,950
leading by example is really important

00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:40,600
we're all anybody who's here is probably

00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:42,700
involved enough in your communities that

00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,440
you are in fact a leader so the ways

00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,030
that we act in the ways that we treat

00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:50,740
people other people notice and do the

00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:56,050
same it's really important to me and I

00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:58,060
think too many of us right this is the

00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:04,750
fun slide about the things that we don't

00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:06,810
do so I think what's important to me to

00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:11,220
point out here is a lot of this is

00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:14,760
relatively obvious but one thing is that

00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:17,260
the impact of violent language that is

00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:20,070
just and I'm using what Americans call

00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,300
air quotes there in words on a screen is

00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,520
big and it sometimes might seem like

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,320
that's not a big impact but one of the

00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,370
things that studies show is that violent

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,020
words lead to violent behavior right so

00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,580
we don't tolerate violent words we don't

00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,100
tolerate people talking about killing

00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:39,670
each other people talking about guns

00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:42,070
know another thing that's maybe not

00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:44,350
always obvious is influencing or

00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:46,660
instigating unacceptable behavior so

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,280
like heckling a speech is not okay

00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,740
neither is elbowing your neighbor and

00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:53,050
being like oh this person yeah let that

00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,870
guy right that's not okay

00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:59,230
the thing that's in italics that's

00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:01,510
because that's a recent submission that

00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:05,830
I'm adding in to the guidelines which is

00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:07,930
that it's not okay to be at an event and

00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:11,250
see someone say something totally racist

00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:12,959
or sexist or homophobic to someone else

00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,970
and not deal with it that doesn't mean

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,949
to like interrupt and make a giant scene

00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,949
you need to find a way to deal with it

00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:22,230
right and that's hard that's a big

00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:26,639
expectation right but I think it's

00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:28,110
important that as as community we stand

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,300
together and take care of each other so

00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:35,430
that's why we're making that evolution

00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:37,560
of our guidelines well this is a big

00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,480
long slide and I'm not gonna go into

00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,399
detail here but what I want to say is if

00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,680
you are a person who's creating your own

00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,970
guidelines our code of conduct it's

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,399
really important to spell out really

00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:49,379
clearly for people what will happen if

00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,120
they make a report or if someone makes a

00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:53,430
report what potential sorts of

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,079
consequences there are who will hear

00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:58,170
about it because that makes people both

00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:59,759
to a more safe reporting and feel

00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,949
hopefully less worried that there's

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,610
going to be some random thing that's

00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:08,730
going to come after them right if people

00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:11,039
don't know who's at the other end of the

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,659
thing right they have something really

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,799
painful that they need to tell someone

00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:15,360
and they're sending it to an anonymous

00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,429
email alias and they don't know who's on

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,069
the other end they may not do it right

00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:21,870
so we try to be really explicit you will

00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:24,030
reach these people these are the things

00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:25,890
that could happen when people respond to

00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:29,250
us we have a whole process that we go

00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:31,049
through and you'll hear like I will get

00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,880
back to you in this many days I will not

00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:34,820
tell anybody else about this until you

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,520
tell me it's okay those kinds of things

00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:40,470
really I have found this to be important

00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,289
and in general I would say if you're the

00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:45,750
person who's created a code of conduct

00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:47,429
or guidelines for your organization

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,880
what are the number one things and I'll

00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:54,600
get to this more is just be prepared for

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,450
people to actually use them it's really

00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:00,320
a big deal things we've learned we

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:02,549
learned a lot we're a little tired so

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,289
the first thing I noticed when we

00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:06,270
revised the guidelines we just started

00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:08,309
talking about them more talking about

00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:11,130
them a lot more going to lots of

00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:13,080
meetings and talking about them and we

00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,940
started getting a lot more reports and

00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,980
I'll admit it at first I was like oh my

00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,830
gosh something's going on suddenly

00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,970
there's all this problematic behavior so

00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,590
I went and talked to people who know a

00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,480
lot about this kind of thing you know

00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,309
about this kind of thing human resources

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,260
departments because they deal with it at

00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:29,820
work right I said oh no that doesn't

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,650
mean there's more problematic behavior

00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,740
it means people are telling you about

00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:36,450
the behavior that was already there so

00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,789
then I started hearing other things I

00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:40,500
started hearing I feel so much safer

00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:42,360
thank you for making it really clear

00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,059
that it's not okay for people to bug me

00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,500
about why I'm not drinking right thank

00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:48,210
you for making it really clear that it's

00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,150
not okay for people to walk up to me and

00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,679
touch my hair right thank you for being

00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:56,760
really clear that it's not okay to

00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:58,740
comment on my religion it's not okay to

00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,730
make snarky comments about my not doing

00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:04,980
work on the Sabbath whatever it is

00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:07,679
because it's not okay and it was going

00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,419
on all along and once you start talking

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,960
about it things start changing but they

00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:14,429
start changing in a lot of ways there's

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,990
a lot of value in the positive

00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:20,850
reinforcement there's a lot of surprises

00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:24,809
here was a really unexpected story that

00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:27,630
I heard I got this email and it was from

00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:30,240
some people who had gone to JavaScript

00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:31,770
Brazil and at JavaScript Brazil

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,960
something had gone down that they felt

00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,100
like was really not awesome and they

00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,230
were like we really want to write this

00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,850
letter of support to this woman who got

00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,679
up on stage at Java Script Brazil and

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,539
talked about gender and tech and had

00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,399
this really negative experience and we

00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:46,289
want to know if we can say in it that

00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:49,440
this but that we got this idea from your

00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:51,840
guidelines and I was like yes please go

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,820
for it javascript people of Brazil I

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,980
don't know these people I've never met

00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,990
them it's just the power of the internet

00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:01,820
doing something really awesome it's

00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,820
gonna happen it happened to me in a few

00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:09,929
so I would say the biggest thing that

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,190
we've learned is that enforcement is

00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:13,890
hard but not impossible

00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:15,809
if you build these policies you have to

00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,419
expect that people will use them you

00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:20,640
need to practice responding we literally

00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:22,320
came up with scenarios and talked about

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,179
them and we're still doing this I think

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,559
not everyone has gotten to do it yet but

00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,159
it's like all right here at a conference

00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:32,809
and somebody comes to you yeah question

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,809
time it's been half an hour

00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:40,280
thank you for that um I'll wrap I'm

00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:44,670
almost done so I want to take questions

00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:46,710

00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,850
languages if you speak another language

00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:55,620

when they don't have resources to solve

00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,480
conflicts they just don't solve them and

00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:16,350
