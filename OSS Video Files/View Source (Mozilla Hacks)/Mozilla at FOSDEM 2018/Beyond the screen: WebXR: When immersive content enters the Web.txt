	00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:10,219
so we're going around against the clock

00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,840
I don't have enough time for everything

00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:14,000
I want to say so feel free to come ask

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,869
for questions and the little clock is

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,490
the red bar under there so I'll just

00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:22,460
quick show off handle so to get a bit

00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:24,410
more excited and to stretch a little bit

00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,560
because I have so little time

00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,890
who are more interested by VR than eight

00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,390
or more virtuality

00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,370
okay and who is more interested by

00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:40,010
augmented reality than virtual reality

00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:40,850
okay and who is in the wrong room not

00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,860
here

00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:46,160
everybody is in the video so I'll star

00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:48,220
still with VR simply because it's more

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,980
stable it just works better now and

00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:53,870
instead of telling you how directly the

00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,000
code works I will tell you what I

00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,649
believe is the point of VR in the first

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,620
place so what's the point of virtual

00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:02,870
reality so it's to do things you cannot

00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,869
do it's not to do things that you should

00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,759
do but you don't do for example I should

00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:11,960
go a bit more than to the gym I don't do

00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:13,430
that I like to dive and I haven't been

00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,640
for a while didn't take the time to do

00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,960
that so I could do that in VR but that's

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,030
not the point the point is for things

00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,670
that you really cannot do so for example

00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,979
I like to go out on Mars I've never been

00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,200
there that's starting to be interesting

00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:29,570
but maybe at some point I know if you're

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,970
optimistic on inter-planetary travel

00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,700
that might out maybe I'll be able to do

00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:36,950
that at some point but another galaxy

00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,020
definitely not so that's starting to be

00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:43,130
interesting actually I think to be

00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:47,180
important or to visit hyperbolic place

00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:50,090
of planes like there that well there is

00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:53,780
in my opinion value but still viewing

00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:56,570
itself doesn't matter your is the time

00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,610
you spend in VR can be interesting can

00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,979
be entertaining but it's when you remove

00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,900
the headset after those your session

00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:05,450
that hopefully you've learned something

00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,040
you had a good time you can help your

00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,619
friends or you can help your colleagues

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,510
so not the time in the headset that's

00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:13,190
very but it's the time after once you

00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,430
remove the headset that I think really

00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,450
has a value so one very concrete example

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,330
that was done

00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:25,849
few were shown a few months ago that's

00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:28,220
from the prison in the US where inmates

00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:30,980
were able to use the aura to discover or

00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,959
to train rather for the real world

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,630
outside to train back to society because

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,190
for example I don't know you have to

00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,860
step back and imagine that you've been

00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,290
an inmate for 10 20 30 years and then

00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,850
you go out and you suddenly show you

00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,069
something like this you don't actually

00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:47,840
know what it is and then you have

00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:49,519
interviews you start to try to integrate

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,590
and all those little steps that are

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,420
obvious for anybody else or not anymore

00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,310
you don't know how I don't know to use a

00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,780
washing machine to I ruin your shirt

00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,640
before an interview and all the steps

00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,650
that are really obvious you don't have

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,290
access to so I think that's really

00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,660
really billion use of the odds but again

00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,640
it's after once you remove the headset

00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:11,420
that it's important not the time spent

00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:13,610
in there so what's we are video is

00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,440
basically fooling your senses being able

00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,239
to say hey here is what I see in front

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,069
of me and I move my head I'm in the

00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,319
headset and then I can see something

00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:23,690
else and the image always matches your

00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:25,760
intuition your point of view so the new

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,079
you're not like wearing a headset you're

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,829
basically somewhere else

00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:32,510
hence the example of the holodeck there

00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:34,220
how does that actually work so I can

00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:37,100
spend the next 20 minutes

00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,410
fish on telling you how actually the

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,209
technology works and how the different

00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,220
sensors are working and how the data is

00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:45,320
being passed and how you can get your

00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,790
position in space which is indeed how it

00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,799
works but that's keeping the most

00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:52,910
important part of the technology behind

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:55,640
your which is the human brain so that

00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,590
that's an in little illustration from

00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,780
one of the most fascinating research

00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:02,600
I've read the last week actually so it's

00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:05,420
pretty still blowing my mind now those

00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:08,150
are beetles in Australia and there are

00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,680
male beetles and I don't know if you can

00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,000
really see what they're trying to do but

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,880
they're trying to reproduce with this

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,230
gorgeous beer bottle because somebody

00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,570
they're just like through tossed the

00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,079
bottle away but this for this kind of

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,880
beetle

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,950
looks like the most gorgeous female

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,010
beetle because it has exactly the right

00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:26,560
colour it's a little bit shiny has some

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,630
sonot so it's kind of a super signal

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,360
that hey this is exactly what I want to

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:34,120
do what is whom I need that's my my

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,370
special someone so what what it's

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,200
actually illustrating is that it doesn't

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:42,910
matter really what you see it's

00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,680
basically some interface to whether the

00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,630
information that's actually useful to

00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,090
you you don't see the world as it is

00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:51,670
you see literally your perception or

00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:54,460
drivin by efficiency and this efficiency

00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:56,620
is making everything that you see for

00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,960
your own goal it's not how the world is

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,760
actually and there are lots of you

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,830
currently see the diagram at the bottom

00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,050
but if you ran some evolutionary

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,670
simulation you can see that all the

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,400
population that are driven to get

00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:12,000
information realistically with perfect

00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,200
veracity just are driven to extinction

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,790
the population that are actually

00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,190
succeeding is the one that are aiming

00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:20,080
for fitness so how information that you

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,940
see is actually useful for you that's

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,280
exactly how your works for us

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:27,580
so yes you've been warned about the kids

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,830
uh I'm pretty passionate about the or

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:33,700
but also about pizza I love it because

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:40,120
it tastes delicious it has such a good

00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:42,370
smell such good colors and the problem

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,080
is first I don't have one with me and

00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,780
the other so I can share with everybody

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,130
there but the problem is when you want

00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,140
to share of your experience

00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,270
it's exactly like trying to share pizza

00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,130
with somebody who never had pizza so

00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,320
imagine a friend somebody really nice

00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,850
you care for him or her but somehow they

00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,200
never happy then you try to convey

00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,720
because you have to convince him over to

00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,600
go to the pizzeria because that's where

00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,550
it's good and well if you haven't tasted

00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,550
pizza you just don't get it so it

00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:12,490
doesn't matter how smart educated you're

00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:14,440
if you haven't put a headset on you can

00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,990
come after and we'll chat I actually

00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,240
have a headset there and just put it on

00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,620
once if you don't have time to catch me

00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,000
you don't want to speak with me after

00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,920
they are in every city including

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,690
Brussels a lot of your centers so just

00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,890
go want you don't have to like it you

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,530
don't have to think it's going to change

00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:31,150
anything but don't assume regardless of

00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,530
Education whether than the complete

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,270
understanding of the brain and the

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,599
technology that you understand what

00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,279
you're

00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:40,960
if you haven't put the headset on at

00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:44,139
least once now we're at first then but

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,899
regardless of the place I think your

00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:48,279
open source in VR actually is pretty

00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:51,099
important because if you think back up

00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:52,779
the holodeck I want to build a whole

00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:56,639
world around me or my friends or my

00:06:52,779 --> 00:07:00,339
colleagues if I have some kind of

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,899
arbitrary limitations that's frustrating

00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:03,699
but I think when you're talking about

00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:04,959
actually building the whole reality

00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:06,849
around you I think it's more than first

00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,979
raining it's actually dangerous and it

00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:10,389
can have some business implication

00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:12,999
political how are you gonna call it

00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:14,259
might know the guy in the t-shirt so

00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:16,930
that's why I'm contributing to Mozilla

00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:18,309
because I think having the tools to

00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,379
build your holodeck and not have

00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:23,219
artificial limitations or actually

00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:25,809
pretty important so what we actually do

00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:27,580
like said before I contribute to really

00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:30,719
frame I'll detail but all those

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:33,490
different pieces and tools are about I

00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:35,289
do some bull request I solve some I

00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,269
complain a bit whining on some issues

00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:39,129
going to detail as much as I can what

00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:41,439
the problem is documentation because I

00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:44,529
discussed before it is pretty important

00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:47,229
and I participated to all hence before I

00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:48,580
went to Asia to showcase and make people

00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:52,269
actually have their first time in New

00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:54,669
York but arguably maybe I like to chat

00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:56,199
too much but I would say one of my most

00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:58,479
important contribution is resting their

00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:00,279
own slack so if you go under FM slack

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,050
with a little bit of luck if you have

00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,129
your first time and somehow it doesn't

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,769
work as expected

00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:09,669
just ask I'll probably be around I'll

00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:11,680
try at least to help you some other

00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:14,709
contribution is basically doing proof of

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,449
concept of little demos because I think

00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:18,399
those are pretty important they look

00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:21,999
pretty innocent but so to describe a bit

00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:23,919
like what you see now I there is you can

00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:25,689
you can use your with some controllers

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,219
again if you haven't tried this like to

00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:31,209
be able to see your hands and interact

00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:32,500
and paint it is pretty amazing and since

00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:33,729
I don't go to the gym that off and I

00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,810
thought I would train and stay a bit of

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,360
soccer

00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:39,159
obviously then I need my hands to grab

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,380
the ball but also to have controllers on

00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:43,300
my seats to be able to kick the ball so

00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,720
I just went to the kitchen take some

00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,240
plastic wrap and wrap

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,100
on my feet wasn't the most comfortable

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,350
but it actually did work so I'm playing

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,870
against a 3d model of myself I scare

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:56,569
myself and I manage to lose but you know

00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:59,120
training so that gives me a full-body

00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:01,790
motion in my entire body from all my

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,779
limbs are there and I can actually the

00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:07,970
sense of immersion is even more present

00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:10,310
so that's a silly little demo that it

00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,810
hasn't been done before and it's giving

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,720
me a stepping stone that's a one way to

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:15,139
learn out of it and I don't feel good

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,329
about it

00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:20,589
visually it's not pleasing but it was

00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:22,730
new back then and I let others also

00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:24,319
experiment with it so it's the stepping

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,180
stone for me little learning tool that

00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:27,889
also for the community at large so make

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,569
huggy demos because it's fun because

00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:31,459
it's interesting its challenges a bit

00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,899
and also because then you share it back

00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:35,360
with the whole community it's a whole

00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:38,300
new field so we need to learn from each

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,160
other so that's great I made my little

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,750
thing I spent a bit of time but the

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,180
point after is to be able to share it so

00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:47,300
obviously that's whether the web is

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:49,519
taking the most values I give the link

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,230
to until he can open it if you want when

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,449
we can collaborate on it then the

00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,819
question is ok that's cute but can you

00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:57,019
actually do 3d on the web so I took

00:09:55,819 --> 00:10:00,889
because it's a question that comes

00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:02,630
pretty often have a bunch of examples we

00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:05,180
won't have time for all of them so don't

00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:08,230
worry about it the links will be at the

00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,230
end of the presentation

00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,370
for example

00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:29,260
so yes all the words are in 3d you have

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,920
some kind of reflection you have for

00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:35,529
some of them physics days are rendering

00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,540
you have different effects and it's all

00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:38,950
running there it's not if you're

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,290
wondering okay that that's cool that

00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:43,570
it's on the super powerful machine the

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:45,700
graphic card is an HD 620 which is

00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,640
basically the cheapest integrated

00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:52,649
chipset you can have now on a laptop and

00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:58,060
this one also so it's all in real time

00:10:52,649 --> 00:11:00,670
and just look around so that's really on

00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:03,520
the web so yeah okay if you look at the

00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,620
latest you need to and real demo not

00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,290
exactly is it the same but I would argue

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:10,330
that pretty much that's pretty

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:13,899
convincing let's say it's not just a

00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:15,970
cube Oh a sphere and they are again

00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:18,250
pledging other demos to explore them so

00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:20,020
I'm sorry regarding the previous talk I

00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,630
didn't include directly the MD end

00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:24,070
tables because web viewer it was then

00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:27,279
really there and I didn't have time to

00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:30,670
bid it myself but yes you can still use

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,440
can I use so 3d on the web works and

00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,970
you're basically on the web works it

00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,650
doesn't work everywhere but for example

00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,959
this big column which name I won't

00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,730
mention is full of flags so it's mostly

00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:41,650
working and it's working pretty much on

00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:45,820
mobile too so doesn't work everywhere

00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:47,880
but on mobile on HTC vive rift windows

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,959
mix reality it's working pretty well and

00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,970
then you have trolley fuels throughout

00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,940
the trick even if you don't have of your

00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,950
headset you can still use it because you

00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:00,310
on the web you can seal it with just

00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:03,220
quote unquote a laptop or a desktop or

00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:05,890
tablet so yes you do aim in the end for

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:09,220
your headset but any device will

00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,990
actually work and the web is not just

00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,880
like a lower version of nerdy but they

00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:16,300
did show an example just before 3d on

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,220
the web but it's not just a port let's

00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,170
say because well first of all you can

00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,600
have everything you can roughly from

00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,220
native but since also mentioned before

00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,529
using serviceworker you can have an

00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,940
offline version so you're using a web

00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:29,500
page you don't have a connection it

00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,480
still works so that's pretty good for

00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,310
this kind of experience and also

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,110
you can do things you cannot do just in

00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:38,709
native so if you are elliptic close your

00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:41,839
eyes now because the next slide is disco

00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:44,060
so here we're diving from one gear

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,820
experiment to the next and there are

00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:49,040
just pages just links so for example if

00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,540
you make a page and then you make a bed

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,670
and I make a page we can link to each

00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,620
other without asking for permission and

00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,240
that's without removing the headset if

00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,880
you do that using native then you will

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,769
have to go back let's say to the oculus

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,589
home or vai phone that's just not

00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:07,070
possible they're native so that's cool

00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:08,630
but how well you can code for it but

00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,300
let's say you don't feel like it on this

00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:14,029
day well there's this little logo you

00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,529
might recognize that that has been done

00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:17,810
literally by taking your of your

00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:20,750
controller and painting those strokes in

00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:23,089
space you have a one-to-one mapping so

00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,889
it's using a painter you have the link

00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:27,949
also in the reference and the logo there

00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:30,199
but you just paint the tail here just by

00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:32,300
doing the movement in space so it means

00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:36,019
you can use view or not just to consume

00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:38,120
content also to create content if you

00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:39,560
want after that - so that's a little bit

00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,839
more of the interface how it's working

00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,910
so you just have your first controller

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,040
that can be a pallet of the different

00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:48,410
brushes the different colors and then

00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,940
again just a few making paint with both

00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,100
hands you can be pretty fun you start

00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:54,170
dancing and everything can be pretty

00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,810
serious of course you can do serious 3d

00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:59,810
assets but and if you have tried blender

00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:02,329
it's an amazing tool and I'm not exactly

00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:06,050
the same usage but then doing this kind

00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:07,670
of complex methods is pretty tricky so

00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,980
for somebody like me who can just do

00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,720
that that's good with the inspector on

00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,240
the other end there if I'm inspector

00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,930
allows to just you would expect from a

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,730
3d editor to grab an object using your

00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:22,250
mouse and all your keyboard and then

00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:25,339
change the scale its position etc again

00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:27,620
without coding one line a frame itself

00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:29,870
is the framework behind it behind a

00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,889
painter on the inspector that allows to

00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,120
actually code for it

00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:34,120
so I'll do a quick example

00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:45,560
so let's it will be mostly copy-paste

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:48,620
because Alex use time so I'll just go on

00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,060
the airframe that I website because I

00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:53,720
don't know what I'm doing I'll go on the

00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:55,400
documentation and first link well there

00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,190
is a bit of code there but I never I

00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:05,330
want to get it so I just click on remix

00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:07,670
from a frame we mix your own I cross my

00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:09,440
fingers of course because last minute

00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:13,160
problem the mole this probably won't

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:18,500
work but let's try naively so that's

00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:21,020
about ten lines and that's it I have

00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,730
here my little video object so you're

00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,080
not sure you don't really believe me

00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:27,740
first I'm normal

00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:33,470
so here the box is blue so I will make

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:41,530
it give me a color yellow he I don't

00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:41,530
know him I it's not magic and yes

00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:52,839
jokes aside that's an actual URL so if

00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:55,749
you go now on bug - close that beach

00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,819
that me that will work on your phone

00:15:55,749 --> 00:16:00,879
don't go there because connection notice

00:15:57,819 --> 00:16:02,800
but if you could go you would and if you

00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,329
have for example the vibe or any kind of

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,610
high-end headset that would work so it

00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:08,980
goes from high-end to actually not see

00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:12,399
or to low-end D or to high-end via all

00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:14,259
the way so that took about one two

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,939
minutes basically to have literally

00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:17,829
nothing nothing installed to create

00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:24,759
content and also nothing install to

00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:26,429
consume content okay I recommend this

00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:30,249
book

00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:31,809
okay so useful like for one cube or

00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:33,730
cylinder ones few you're not really

00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:35,949
impressed so it starts from really

00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,689
really simple to going really all the

00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:39,670
way down so it should be a graphic

00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:42,759
programmer then you can go all the way

00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,589
down to shaders because it's nice to

00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:46,209
have those basic visuals but if you want

00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:49,179
to have your own either special effects

00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:51,910
or deformation of 3d objects you can use

00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:53,949
that true so there are a lot of really

00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,089
cool website to learn how to do that and

00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:57,759
then to integrate it back

00:16:55,089 --> 00:17:00,220
so why also I insist on that is because

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,350
once you've done once you know that its

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,319
shaders all the way down it means its

00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:08,350
executed on the GPU using WebGL

00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:10,449
it means it's pretty close to native I

00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:13,059
would argue ninety eighty percent

00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:14,829
performance wise so again yes it's on

00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:19,630
the web but it doesn't mean it's like a

00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:21,490
lower version of native if you don't

00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:23,230
want to come to write your own component

00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,600
to change the behavior of your objecting

00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:28,990
space then you can reply you can use

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,700
directly again without copy pasting the

00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,710
repository with tons of different

00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,409
content and it goes from very simple one

00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:37,450
like I don't know a mountain to

00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:39,850
motion-capture so if you have an object

00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,919
in space yes you can draw it but then

00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:44,020
after that you can animate so it means

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,840
instead of like coding the line you just

00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,250
take the object move it around repairers

00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,250
play and then it's like a little rabbit

00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,840
jumping for example and then you have

00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,789
physics also so you

00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,900
actually just again straight from the

00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:58,330
browser

00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,799
have you your rabbit yeah you don't want

00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:01,600
to throw the rabbit away that lets the

00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:05,950
ball of basketball then you can make it

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:08,110
bounce so a little summer view of the

00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:11,350
tools a frame is the framework so if you

00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:13,480
want to code in GLSL in custom element

00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:16,059
the kind of sort of HTML as I showed

00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,590
before JavaScript any input whatever

00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:20,230
that may be you want you can use that

00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:22,630
the inspector is to put them in space

00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:25,240
the repository is for all the community

00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:28,539
third-party components the painter is to

00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:30,700
paint role in the orb and then because

00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:33,309
we feel that at the beginning whatever

00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:36,220
you also want to do well it's a whatever

00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:38,169
you want Djoser so I'll keep those Q&A

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,130
is for the ends just one Q&A that's

00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:42,850
there is easy or better than if you're

00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,669
yes/no it depends

00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:48,309
it's not the same thing basically so the

00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:50,890
second and last four is about they are

00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:53,440
specifically augmented reality so let's

00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:55,960
imagine here instead of having this nice

00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:00,549
bottle of water I had actually a

00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:02,950
delicious trapeze near I won't give any

00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:04,929
brand but it's not actually there but I

00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,730
wish it was there so that's basically

00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:09,450
your when you have the illusion with

00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:11,830
unit like with the headset directly

00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:16,480
secluded or blocked in this virtual

00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:21,940
world I would say the biggest limitation

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:23,919
for a native a or that people don't

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,840
download app so if your Facebook if you

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,120
were whatsapp if you were snapchat

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,240
that's cool you okay be definitely the

00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:33,779
top ten and you spent hours and dozens

00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,740
of days or two to make your a or app

00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:37,539
nobody's going to actually download it

00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,909
we still download it now because if

00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:41,770
there is some kind of novelty factor but

00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:43,750
bit by bit it's wearing down and I think

00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:46,179
even if there wasn't this novelty factor

00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:48,640
if you spend more time installing an app

00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:51,549
than using it there is somehow a kind of

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,100
problem so seen mostly our applications

00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:56,020
are just few minutes long with little

00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,960
bits of information what I like to

00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,190
imagine is they were just like finger

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,320
food basically you just have a little

00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:04,330
doubt but if you spend more time

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,919
actually preparing and enjoying it

00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:08,710
there is clearly a distribution problem

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:11,399
obviously once again the web to the

00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:16,059
rescue so that started a while back

00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:17,850
meaning about seven years ago or ten

00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:20,950
years ago at Georgia Tech they were

00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:24,039
Blair McIntyre who is now at Madeira for

00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:27,880
the Easter your project started a

00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:29,890
browser to do a or where does it work on

00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,200
which hardware I would argue everywhere

00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:34,779
ish in the sense that as soon as you

00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,490
have a camera you can do a or not

00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:39,039
amazing you are but you can already

00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:41,620
superimpose whatever three do to the

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:44,440
object in front of reality the more

00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:46,240
hardware you have well the more

00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,220
interesting it becomes but also the

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,450
trick you it is because then you are

00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:53,889
going to have to go from general browser

00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,960
to more custom that you'll have to

00:20:53,889 --> 00:20:58,659
actually do build yourself at components

00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,429
and so the more hardware and the more

00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:02,590
advanced the usage the tricky wit will

00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:04,480
be so if you just want to superimpose on

00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:08,950
a camera whatever coming to view hard we

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:13,090
will do the most is there is just way to

00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:16,929
do it now if you have an iPhone or any

00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:19,990
kind of modern iOS device will be to get

00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:22,419
the X or viewer so I'll do a little demo

00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:29,260
with this I will I'll show first how it

00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:34,269
works so that was in my kitchen

00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:36,130
yesterday morning was kind of keen and

00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:37,929
then you see the grid on the flow and

00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:39,580
all those little yellow dots so the

00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,230
yellow dots or a point of interest

00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,450
basically where you have sufficient

00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,889
amount of contrast and then it's unique

00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,500
in at let's say so that when you move

00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:49,809
the phone it's able to localize itself

00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,549
by inverting okay the points are getting

00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,230
further or closer away that I'm getting

00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:55,840
closer further away from the previous

00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:59,279
location and yeah I used my hand so it

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,570
was pretty stable in a closed position

00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,220
so yeah that's that's how it works

00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,990
finding those little yellow dots and

00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:09,610
then moving around to see if they move

00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:11,080
from the last frame basically and then

00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:13,100
once you have that when you have your

00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,650
position relative to

00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,900
points in space you don't have to show

00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:19,910
them first of all it was just to explain

00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,340
you how it works and then you can put

00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:24,680
objects in space and then you can put

00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:28,880
your materials and store to to tell run

00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:30,620
away this and it doesn't have to move to

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:35,150
show a little bit the degree of

00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:37,580
precision then this is in my salon not

00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,470
in the kitchen this time I just put the

00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,080
first Oh actually all my little anchors

00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:47,570
that have their position in in space and

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:49,520
a meter they had from wherever and then

00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,970
it's about two meters and then you see

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,710
the measure it's more or less two meters

00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:56,360
if you already familiar with vgs which

00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:58,580
is basically the default choice if you

00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,080
wanted it to be on the web board no let

00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,870
me say it another way the most popular

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,630
way to do 3d on the web then all those

00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:07,130
utility function like distance tools you

00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:09,320
had to first point the second point and

00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:11,300
you just get a value to get the distance

00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,110
it's out of the box you don't even have

00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:16,000
to do all this

00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:18,800
kind of difficult mathematics yourself

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,290
there are those some limitations

00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:24,200
it's not magic so for example now if you

00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:26,270
use Orakei toric or which is what each

00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:30,080
of you is using it doesn't it only no

00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:32,180
flat surfaces just the plane so if you

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,070
want to make an object let's say window

00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:36,170
you want to make it move you basically

00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:39,410
have to position it on the floor and

00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:41,750
then bring it like a little menu on the

00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:44,930
side and and you able still to have the

00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:48,140
object vertically moving and yeah a

00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:51,110
little you see the little box there in

00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:53,930
the back it's because it's just a 2d

00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:56,030
camera so it has no notion it's not a

00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:58,400
depth sensor so it doesn't have a notion

00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:02,570
that this subject is behind let's say

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:06,410
this shelf or this other object so it

00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:08,390
works but with with some limitations so

00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:11,060
that was two days ago

00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,760
if you want to set a time for a or you

00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:15,410
don't have to buy or three thousand

00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,600
dollars or your hololens you can take

00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:20,090
the top of your Tupperware and then

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,600
start to simulate how or what the

00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:24,000
different actions will be

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,470
great but actually if you want to convey

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,940
to a friend or colleague how it works

00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:29,190
pretty efficient because you can so to

00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,290
say hey I'll measure this space and then

00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,610
I'll move it around because that's

00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:35,670
basically the gist that you'll have with

00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:42,510
your phone if you do it demo time second

00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:45,140
demo time okay look what superfast let's

00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,140
see if it works

00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,260
No

00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:07,660
the matter that's right

00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:11,049
so

00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:18,490
you can see my phone yes okay so I

00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:20,019
stored the Xserve you were I don't know

00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:22,380
shows everything already

00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,380
don't look

00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:28,790
bit of suspense

00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,770
again still serious

00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:39,200
so I'm looking for the little yellow

00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:42,140
points I showed you before and I should

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,310
show you if I see so I don't see I see

00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,670
some that's good

00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:50,750
okay so disappeared I have my grid and

00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:56,440
then I can put my objects there and if I

00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:56,440
turn around the anchor in space

00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:06,179
yes so how does it work is again I

00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:10,590
import a frame to be able to position my

00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:13,640
object in space and then using the FM

00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:16,110
picks or library then I can use actually

00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,480
the camera of the phone as a bathroom

00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:21,179
camera and then to localize myself in

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,460
space and I can still use all the syntax

00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:27,330
those custom elements in a frame I'm

00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:29,970
familiar with okay there was this yeah

00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:31,769
again white white matter is because I

00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,960
think a or is a pretty powerful medium

00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:35,909
but it's a new medium if we are already

00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,649
trapped within some kind of proprietary

00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:40,019
echo system then we can't actually

00:26:37,649 --> 00:26:42,389
explore and that's not the kind of

00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:43,500
future r1 so I want to be able to go

00:26:42,389 --> 00:26:45,799
wherever I want with it

00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,139
what's actually yet to come so for

00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:50,730
obviously we want higher pixel density

00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:53,250
if you have tried V or two or three

00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:55,830
years ago try again because if you try

00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:57,330
the vibe flow or something Odyssey the

00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:00,000
pixel density is pretty good so you can

00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:01,440
still if you focus see the pixel but it

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,510
doesn't you nearly don't see them

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,130
anymore if you don't pay attention for

00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:08,130
tracking it's a better position as you

00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:09,480
saw I was it was a little bit a bit my

00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:13,200
phone was stressed by the presentation

00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:15,659
but was not perfectly aligned so that's

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,250
also with a depth center we have in more

00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:19,799
and more autonomous core that's getting

00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:22,590
to go way cheaper and the way more

00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:26,429
popular and finally better unification

00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:28,980
with WebEx or so a little extra on this

00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:31,350
so last port which actually last three

00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,690
seconds is to say just that

00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:35,549
wedeck's are is actually where they are

00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:37,950
where they are and where they more and

00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:40,649
web whatever our or any kind of reality

00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:42,690
is now under WebEx or specification

00:27:40,649 --> 00:27:44,519
specification might sound a little bit

00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,710
abstract but if you interested in the

00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,970
field it's a pretty open discussion it

00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,470
includes all the different browsers

00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:51,269
vendors all the different port

00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:53,130
interested so I invite you to join the

00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:55,860
specification to see how it works and

00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:58,769
also to share your needs on it last

00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:01,590
absolute last slide is don't trust your

00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:03,240
perception it doesn't matter if you do a

00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:05,250
order or something else as long as you

00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,139
build useful interfaces that's what

00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:09,090
matters

00:28:06,139 --> 00:28:11,009
and that's it slides over there you can

00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:13,130
just search and all the reference out

00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:16,359
there with the example thank you

00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:16,359
