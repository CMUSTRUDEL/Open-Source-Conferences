	00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:13,820
okay thank you I sincerely hope that you

00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,520
can hear me in the last rows because I'm

00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:19,279
coming from the warm weather of Rome and

00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,539
here in Brussels already made some a

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,939
little bit of damage this coat but

00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:24,230
anyways if you cannot hear me please

00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:29,780
raise your hands

00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:32,899
I hope so yeah yeah this is the thing it

00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,309
has a green light so I really hope it's

00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:40,760
a good indication that it probably was

00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:43,190
working so city of Bologna 2015 yeah a

00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,839
lot of road construction works and of

00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,819
course just like in with the any road

00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:49,760
construction site it attracts a lot of

00:00:46,819 --> 00:00:52,789
people a lot of people who just go there

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,979
and try to see and see if the if the

00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:57,319
road is being done correctly just like

00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:58,760
they used to do in their times and it's

00:00:57,319 --> 00:01:00,499
such a popular phenomenon I guess not

00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,299
just in Bologna and not just in Italy

00:01:00,499 --> 00:01:04,040
but all around the world but we have

00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:06,860
created this world which is called

00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,780
Umarov and over L means exactly this is

00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,470
the person it's a little man and it's

00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:15,770
the person usually of old age who goes

00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:18,260
and checks the work and to give you a

00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:21,380
couple of facts about Omer s eleven

00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,030
thousand euros this is the budget that

00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,270
the city of rich shown a just close to

00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:28,430
Bologna allocated yearly to pay a steep

00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,230
into this Umarov because they do provide

00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,300
a useful service to the administration

00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,150
did you provide an the serve as a double

00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:37,160
check to me to ensure that the public

00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:40,640
works are carried out not in a good way

00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,290
and this guy here was the first one to

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,960
be a word at the price of a morale of

00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:46,940
the Year 2015

00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,190
Franco there was a nice celebration

00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:52,070
where the vice major gave this award and

00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:54,920
nominated him head of the world

00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,090
construction site for one day but to

00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,090
introduce you know somebody who is

00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:02,030
definitely not a numeral don't say I

00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:04,550
ever made this metaphor is my boss

00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:08,450
Diego patient Dini so we take action

00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:11,629
teeny he was the senior vice president

00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:15,260
of Amazon and he took a two years leave

00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:17,060
to be tasked with the job of digitizing

00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,609
and modernizing Italy it was named

00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,090
Commissioner for Digital Agenda so what

00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:22,940
did he do

00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:25,840
form the team team of 30 super experts

00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:30,080
at as the the press would define them

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,959
and try to tackle this in men's job 130

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,610
seems like a medium to large agency well

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,860
if you put all of us in the same room or

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:40,040
in the same flight it's not that many

00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:43,220
people so in order to tackle this

00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:46,340
enormous task we set up some plans and

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:50,390
they go so to be effective we need to be

00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:53,930
we need to work on the infrastructure we

00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:57,980
need to be plumbers what do I mean by

00:02:53,930 --> 00:03:00,560
this I mean just like a plumber has made

00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,870
mixes on job in your own house or in a

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,799
building you will only know about the

00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:09,110
job that he did where or she did when it

00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,730
was done not properly otherwise it's

00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,700
hidden it's in the foundation is in the

00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,180
infrastructure and just like any good

00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,599
plumber

00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:20,480
at the beginning he started to ride with

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,280
the team at the 3-year plan he'd start

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,010
to lay down the plans for what they

00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,680
would do in this in this program and

00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,209
well it's a rather big document which is

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,310
also translated into English but it's

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,870
about 150 pages so I'm not going to

00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,489
explain the whole plan to you right now

00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,639
I'm just going to give you a very quick

00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:39,500
glimpse well the first thing that was

00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:40,790
defined was the technology of course the

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,150
technological platforms and

00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:47,420
infrastructure the second part was about

00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:50,959
the processes defining processes and the

00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:53,120
third one were to decide tools that

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,579
would embody those processes the word

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,769
decided and this is exactly where

00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:59,599
openness and hack ability comes in

00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:01,340
because of course technology is an

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:05,450
enabling factor you need to have

00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:07,130
enabling platforms which allow you to to

00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,769
build something so it needs to be

00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:12,349
generic it needs to be API based etc but

00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:13,459
the real the real key the one with the

00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:15,169
message that I want to explain to you

00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:18,680
today goes into these two levels the

00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:20,510
processes and the tools to give you an

00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,280
idea about the technologies well this is

00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,430
a very very quick summary but basically

00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,200
we created we created or we have to to

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:30,159
to build projects that were already

00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,619
ongoing about the identity so

00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:36,009
digital identity online offline on your

00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:37,599
ID card used with standard chipsets so

00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,159
you can build an open ecosystems around

00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:41,409
it or dine a graphical information

00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:44,199
centralized so you have API as you can

00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:46,439
integrate better applications then a

00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,389
second big chapter was made on platforms

00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:51,309
such as the payment platforms or an API

00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:56,769
ecosystem where you have this pretty

00:04:51,309 --> 00:04:58,659
radical shift of no longer having a

00:04:56,769 --> 00:05:01,089
service being given to the users but

00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:03,490
starting from a set of API so that it

00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:05,439
can be integrated and the machines also

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,999
in the public in the 12,000 public

00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,099
administration that we have easily can

00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:11,949
talk to each other and then of course a

00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:13,749
data and analytics framework so that you

00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:17,469
can properly make use of all the big

00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:19,360
data we are producing and of course all

00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:21,309
these technologies are great but if we

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,059
keep developing them the usual way then

00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:31,569
we keep being in a world garden so how

00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:34,329
do we create the open processes luckily

00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:36,429
for us we have the ready head start we

00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:38,409
had this digital administration code

00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:41,589
which is a pretty pretty advanced code

00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:44,439
in as far as logos and and this was the

00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:46,329
effort that was put in place before we

00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:49,269
arrived in order to open up the

00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:50,769
processes and to sum up the articles

00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:53,459
there are two very nice articles which

00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:56,409
article 68 which says that old public

00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:59,349
administration have to choose open

00:05:56,409 --> 00:06:01,479
source solutions first and that all new

00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:03,839
code that is created for public

00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:06,189
administration should be openly licensed

00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:09,759
but of course this is not enough I mean

00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:11,139
sure having a good low having a good

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,149
framework is absolutely essential

00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:14,860
otherwise you don't have the freedom to

00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:19,089
implement new policies and new processes

00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:20,259
but good tools are as well because it if

00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:22,089
you know if you just provide the law and

00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:24,039
not the tools then it's very hard for

00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:25,449
anybody to complain especially think

00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:28,479
about the definition all software should

00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:33,099
be openly licensed what it means in a

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:35,979
jurisdiction airy system so we started

00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:38,169
to realize that we had to create tools

00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:40,569
and processes and we did it with those

00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:43,410
key technologies that you saw in three

00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:46,690
years plan so

00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:49,690
by choosing this technologies and really

00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:52,240
eating our own dog food we started to

00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:54,720
see how we could implement proper

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,980
processes and tools so we started to

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,570
work on how the source code was

00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:02,800
published and released and we passed

00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:04,990
from something like this to this very

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,820
normal for you some some times it was

00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:12,160
not very something very normal for the

00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,660
people who are working in the public

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,490
administration that the accumulation as

00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,750
well passed from a very long PDF

00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,600
sweetened in the forms of the lower

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:23,140
where you see seen the dairy the decree

00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,180
and similar to read the box and of

00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:27,130
course created a place where you can

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,840
discuss all of your changes and where

00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:32,200
you can just hang out with fellow

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,940
developers but up until now of course

00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,280
this is modernizing this is digitizing

00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:39,250
but why is the video driven innovation I

00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,550
mean really we have seen this before in

00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,350
the u.s. there is 18f there is in France

00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,120
a similar approach from the government

00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,250
where they try to publish all of their

00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:52,510
code on github they try to open-source

00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,590
them the real the real change and I

00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,150
think the real innovation that we're

00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,580
trying to bring forward also

00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,290
communicating with our European partners

00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:02,590
is this is the same difference that has

00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:04,990
is between Android and Debian to put it

00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:07,060
to an extreme which both are open-source

00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,370
but you know there is a clear difference

00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:12,970
between them and it's of course the open

00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:15,430
governance model where with the open

00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,050
governance model the people from the

00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,700
community whether they're individual

00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,740
developers whether they're companies

00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,440
whether there are other actors can

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,680
actually not only contribute and some to

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,660
requests and just watch from the outside

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,150
but also contribute and if they wish

00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:33,130
they can take responsibility for a few

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,140
of the software that are used from

00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:38,500
everybody and from all the citizens

00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:41,260
think of it for example in fire we have

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,479
believed toolkit for doing websites in

00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:46,330
an accessible way which follow respects

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:48,400
all the guideline what if I do a

00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,230
wordpress theme well then this can be

00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,100
easily maintained from the community

00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,560
there is like some core

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,509
available Italian who want to maintain

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,769
it then this is something that can do

00:08:56,509 --> 00:09:00,620
and of course it doesn't need to be

00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:03,380
Italian many of the technologies that we

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,420
are creating are actually or generic the

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,399
whole framework about data processing

00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,589
and data analytics is completely generic

00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:11,870
uses metal base it is a superset it is a

00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:13,880
Jupiter notebook so those are all things

00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,610
that can be of value and it can be

00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,319
shared between the systems and with the

00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:23,959
open governance model we are giving

00:09:18,319 --> 00:09:25,880
power to the community main challenge of

00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:28,370
course is then with the public

00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,839
administration itself because well there

00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:32,600
is some kind of fear that you need to

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,100
overcome when you ask people who are

00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,839
used to working a very closed and locked

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,509
environment and just release once every

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,459
one or two year to do development in the

00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:42,769
open sometimes from day one sometimes

00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:44,690
after the day of the release then you

00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:46,250
need to change the new mindset where if

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,160
you open a pull request that doesn't

00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,899
really mean like okay I'm intruding in

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,639
your work and stepping in your work

00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:54,860
directly it's just like a pull request

00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,300
and you have to answer that because it's

00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,899
somebody that can provide a useful

00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,149
contribution

00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:01,519
maybe the center faction it's all wrong

00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:03,589
you have to explain why so it's a new

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,120
mindset that needs to be put and then of

00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:08,149
course you need to find your clothes

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,550
that work because if I'm just going to

00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,870
say okay you open everything up and you

00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,149
don't provide them a framework in which

00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,740
they can work effectively then this just

00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:19,069
impacts productivity and they're going

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:22,310
to hate you for that so we started this

00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:25,240
community in with the large events on 67

00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:27,500
of October where we have 800 developers

00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,870
27 cities in Italy it was there our

00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,360
largest public hackathon ever organized

00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:35,949
in Europe second one the largest in the

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,949
world because Naser big beat it

00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,209
we were kickstart this community we

00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:44,120
asked for help to develop many of those

00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:48,069
components and all the developers who

00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:50,540
sent him successful to requests where

00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:53,389
were then accepted and were nominated as

00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:58,880
maintainer if they wished to be so of

00:10:53,389 --> 00:11:00,800
course and for the future we are trying

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,529
to now's are in the process where we

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,740
already saw a model that is working and

00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:07,480
we're in the process of

00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,400
scaling things up how do we do that we

00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,980
are writing national guidelines

00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,450
I want to explicit that when once those

00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,830
guidelines are going to be published

00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,200
they're going to be binding for all

00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:18,790
public administrations so this is a

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,580
document we're working on right now

00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:23,380
and which will be open for comments by

00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,350
more or less the end of this month and

00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:30,100
of course all comments are welcome in

00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:32,370
this sense and in this guidance we want

00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:35,410
to write things such as you need to

00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,760
publish and put all your code on a

00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,530
collaborative platform of your choice

00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,830
could be github it could be yourself

00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:44,860
hosted gitlab orga Tia or bitbucket or

00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:46,630
basically whatever you want and we're

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,970
going to propose a model a community

00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:50,710
working model this is the github flow it

00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:53,170
should be it will be something similar

00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,730
to the Gaeta flow where you have several

00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,710
maintainer and you have all public

00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,070
administrations working the same code

00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:02,140
the end goal is to turn all service

00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,850
man's all the people all the coders who

00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,250
are already working for the public

00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,960
administration into real open-source

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,850
developers who know how to contribute

00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,160
upstream when they use upstream projects

00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,980
you know how to publish their work how

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,440
to work together and cooperate it was a

00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,900
pretty pretty challenging task but I

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,500
think it's a it's a highly successful

00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:26,740
one another key part of our strategies

00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,480
they're open innovation hubs what is an

00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:32,950
open innovation hub is a way to

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,560
stabilize this the culture of the

00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:37,480
opening even more it's a series of

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,130
places which are created to promote the

00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,690
open culture in cooperation with the

00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:43,420
universities in cooperation with the

00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,830
municipalities in cooperation with the

00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,140
local institutions so that they can firm

00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:52,000
group about open source and open

00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:53,320
practices and to be a part to be a

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,060
reference point for the public

00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,590
administrations so that they could

00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,720
incorporate so taking the existing

00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:01,510
community and leveraging and the and the

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,180
York of the existence of of existing

00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:06,370
kuvira's already that do and develop

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,530
open source and give them a way to talk

00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,540
to public administrations and on the

00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:12,430
other hand for the public institutions

00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,080
have like some kind of feedback when

00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,970
they want to create new technologies or

00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,540
they have new ideas for the public with

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,070
the public

00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,750
all of these of course in constant

00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,100
communication with other European

00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,360
partners we are speaking about with a

00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,770
French team are speaking about with the

00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,930
European Union with the UK team so to

00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:34,380
sum it up just like Franco was given on

00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:37,709
that day the possibility of driving the

00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:41,100
machine for for making sure that the

00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:44,310
road was even and his dream was to steal

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,810
for one a well we hope that you

00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,540
appreciate and you can be our digital

00:13:45,810 --> 00:14:05,000
Amara for the next days thank you very

00:13:48,540 --> 00:14:05,000
much ok

00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,960
I find it

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,810
mm-hm

00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:53,700
okay so international guidelines we were

00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:56,430
not mandating any specific platforms of

00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,620
course because it would be I think it'll

00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:00,330
be even illegal to do that directly in

00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,280
the National Guard and we are just

00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:04,860
giving the requirements for a platform

00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:07,860
and then we are quoting a few of the

00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:10,050
platforms which satisfy those standards

00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,610
in the case of lock we have one for

00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,350
those key technologies that we created

00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,540
so if you just go on developers dot

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,830
Italy that IT you have the button which

00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,940
is black and then you can get your

00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:22,530
invitation for now this has this was set

00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,570
up for the hackathon so we wanted to

00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:26,910
keep it as free as possible and then now

00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:30,200
we are having all the developers just be

00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,200
there and use that as a reference point

00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:36,410
the thing is it's very very hard to

00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:39,510
choose a good communication method and

00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:41,670
also to a moment a like you could go for

00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:45,090
a hosted solution such as black and

00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:48,120
there you have several competing

00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:50,670
solutions with Pro and cons etc and you

00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,470
can go for your hostage yourself which

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:55,080
is for a hosted solution because it was

00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:58,860
easier to set it up and it was easier to

00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:01,700
maintain it in the long run because we

00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:08,640
need to stabilize this kind of effort

00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:11,280
sorry and get help on the other hand the

00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,890
Italia organization just github.com /

00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,870
Italia it's a completely free

00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,640
organisation because all of the the

00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,860
repositories that are completely public

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:24,090
and open-source so there is no need to

00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:26,580
close it up we I can tell you what we

00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:28,260
did for developers Italia which is the

00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,940
part of the development of those key

00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,380
technologies but then all the

00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,270
administration will be able to choose

00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,890
with basing or based on their needs

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,930
already we have some regions which are

00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:40,230
housed their own software on some kind

00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:42,300
of SourceForge so it really depends on

00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,920
the skills of the administration and and

00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:50,910
what they want to do and what we want to

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:53,270
invest ok wait first you see many hands

00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,270
this is

00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:16,329
so yeah sorry so he says that most most

00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:20,350
contractors will not probably be happy

00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:23,500
about the openness of those projects and

00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:26,260
releasing them as open source what I can

00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,930
tell you is that when like they are

00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:32,260
already obliged by law to release them

00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:34,720
as open source because it is article 69

00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,340
which says oil code made custom for the

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,800
public administration should be released

00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:41,680
openly now the definition of openly

00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:44,590
until now has been somehow problematic

00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:46,390
because it was not never specified like

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,010
okay what does it mean like basically it

00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,840
just need to be free does it to be under

00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,850
certain licenses did you need to give

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,010
you any freedom it was summed up in a

00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:58,450
it's called I reuse catalog where you

00:17:54,010 --> 00:18:00,250
would you would be able to give it to

00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,230
other public administrations for free

00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,600
which is a little bit open source but

00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:06,280
not exactly so what we are doing is by

00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,910
those guidelines which will be binding

00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,170
for the public administrations

00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:13,450
you will need to release it as open

00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:18,430
source otherwise you will not be able to

00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:20,740
participate into in in the core so it's

00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,240
it will be it will be for the new

00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,130
software of course because we cannot do

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,070
it on the previous software but all new

00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:28,750
contracts will be made in this way now

00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,220
this pretty specific details of course

00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,410
you need to wait for the guidelines to

00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,690
be out and published and of course there

00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:38,020
is a commenting work so for this is for

00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:41,560
the exact details but in general I hope

00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:45,720
this answers your questions ok ok I see

00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,720
hands in the back yeah because

00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:55,320
this is a very very good question so he

00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:57,090
was asking about whether the

00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,030
documentation on the forum is just for

00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:02,340
technical development or also for this

00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:05,760
general civilian documentation so he

00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,920
started out for the forum was created

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,920
for discussing the three years plan so

00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:13,200
very very much a civilian but quite

00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,250
technical but still up pretty much it

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,470
was not the accumulation for the

00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:22,020
software then the better have the redox

00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:24,060
part so the technical documentation was

00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,860
created for the software but now we are

00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:29,040
more or less in the process of merging

00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,480
the two things we are we are using the

00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,610
infrastructure that we created for the

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,460
technical documentation also for example

00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:37,380
to host versions of the law one very

00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,700
good example is that this is our

00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,210
administration code which was the first

00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,160
law which was put on github completely

00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:46,380
version and you see you can see all dips

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,210
between the version from 2006 till the

00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,490
one which was passed just last December

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:53,910
and you can see how it evolves with

00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:56,610
regular git diff tool and then you can

00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:58,830
read it and read the docs etc and the

00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:01,170
idea is to try to bring is forward more

00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,550
and more probably the interface will

00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,050
need to be adjusted because of course

00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:06,240
you are serving two different technical

00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:09,450
use cases but we are going to in this

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,860
direction and you have also to consider

00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,210
that most of the documentation for the

00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,680
technical part of course for the Loews

00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,840
is in Italian but for the technical part

00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,370
we are trying to be as international as

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,260
possible most of the documentation is

00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:21,210
actually in English for example about

00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,600
all the data processing is is done like

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,850
that

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,320
and it's also interesting to see that

00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,690
other governments are doing a little

00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,040
some stuff similar to this an example

00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:32,190
what the French government which release

00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,440
the software is called open fisca which

00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,000
is a Python package where they they you

00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,290
can run simulations for your country you

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,450
basically write a Python classes and you

00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:44,190
you define the fiscal system of your

00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,900
country and then it's completely generic

00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:47,970
and you can run simulations you can see

00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,490
how to optimize taxes you can propose

00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:52,500
the reforms and then see the impact of

00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,880
that and you're working on this we're

00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,400
also applying for a google Summer of

00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,930
Code and this is for example if we get

00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,310
accepted

00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,170
the google Summer of Code organization

00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:03,370
one of the challenges that we try to

00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:27,440
propose to adapted for our fiscal system

00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:29,570
okay no questions so you're asking about

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,190
like okay so you're asking about how

00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,660
what is the scope of the program it's

00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,790
just a new software for all software

00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:38,960
open source software so the answer is is

00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:41,630
different so article 60 I go back to the

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,370
low article 68 you have to choose open

00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:46,040
source solutions first what it means is

00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:48,470
I am a public administration and I need

00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,030
a new piece of software the first thing

00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,620
to do I have to do is I have to evaluate

00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,720
what is already present before asking

00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,610
for it to be made for myself and if I

00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,170
found an open source package that is

00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:59,180
good for me or that can be modified it

00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:01,550
for to suit my needs I have to choose

00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:03,200
that I am mandated value to do that you

00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:05,300
can select choose to have something new

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,030
made for me then I need to create it and

00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,530
release it for everybody as open source

00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:11,450
what we are doing is we are adding a

00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:13,250
collaborative model and an open way

00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,140
because until now it was open source

00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,000
like Android okay which is open source

00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,040
but you just get a table every now and

00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,900
then instead with this model you are

00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,610
able actually to maintain it and create

00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,600
a community around that a community

00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:27,290
which could be of value public

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,450
administration citizen everything for

00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:31,970
the governance question if I if I got it

00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:33,620
correctly so asking like who are you

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,690
reporting to we report directly to the

00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:38,030
Prime Minister so this is the head of

00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:39,890
all the public administrations so once

00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:42,980
we do with this work and we release this

00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:45,110
code the presidency the government the

00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:48,230
municipality is the hospitals the

00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:54,490
universities the schools everybody will

00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:54,490
be covered by this please

00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:34,879
okay so the question was mm-hmm if I

00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,200
create a model where you have to release

00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:37,969
an open source the software that you

00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,999
create does do this doesn't this create

00:23:37,969 --> 00:23:42,440
an incentive for more public

00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:44,529
administrations to wait for somebody

00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:48,859
else to do it and then get it for free

00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:50,809
well listen no meaning that if you if

00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:52,489
you have something that you need usually

00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:54,349
usually actually what happens is the

00:23:52,489 --> 00:23:56,209
other way around so you recreate the

00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:58,549
same software over and over because you

00:23:56,209 --> 00:24:00,169
believe that what is there until now

00:23:58,549 --> 00:24:02,869
it's not really good or not exactly

00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:05,259
satisfying your needs I don't think that

00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:09,589
these model changes very much this

00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:10,190
because this was kind of the way it was

00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:12,950
until now

00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:15,200
you have still article 68 an article 69

00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,849
are older than our team are older than

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,339
this collaborative model it's just the

00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:21,889
framework that was already present and

00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:23,659
which we are working so in theory

00:24:21,889 --> 00:24:25,969
already now this could have been a

00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:28,159
problem because all public

00:24:25,969 --> 00:24:30,200
administrations are obliged to give to

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,690
somebody else the software if they if

00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:35,329
they are asked for it for free so and

00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,369
this is not a problem that is arising so

00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:40,789
yes in theory if this is a problem what

00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:43,099
you're quoting but in practice it didn't

00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:44,959
really show up and actually we need to

00:24:43,099 --> 00:24:46,129
encourage more of this participation and

00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:49,629
more of this maintenance of the same

00:24:46,129 --> 00:24:49,629
software I have

00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,789
polity doesn't get more

00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:14,000
they can allocate their budget to that

00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,000
group and then pooling that money

00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:30,549
or just not at all because my apartment

00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,990
has five percenter but I really need to

00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:34,210
hire a human sorry I just want higher

00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,169
human but when I can give the budget

00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:38,340
from somebody else and then they can

00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:38,340
create a pool of funds and have

00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:46,369
yeah absolutely but this is more or less

00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,369
experience resource or minutes

00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,900
the manager go away or one of the more

00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,900
difficult

00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:55,340
okay so the question was for for the

00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:56,539
internet speakers here's speaking about

00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,059
his experience in the Dutch government

00:26:56,539 --> 00:27:03,350
where the bigger problem was to convince

00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:05,419
the manager rate layer that you had to

00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:06,649
like that if you do something as

00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:08,029
open-source than it benefits everybody

00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:10,220
and not just the people who are funding

00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:14,179
you then this is a problem and then how

00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,620
to educate them not to like open source

00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:17,120
is not that much more expensive so you

00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,370
should do open source in general because

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,740
it's better does it sum it up sorry it

00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:26,630
had to be a big summary okay thank you

00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:38,179
if I actually read five minutes left so

00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:40,220
enough time's up well in Italy we are in

00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:43,010
a regular situation because they have to

00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:44,860
release it as open source so you can

00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:48,260
kind of avoid the question in this way

00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:50,080
but in general I would say that leading

00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:52,669
by example is always the best practice

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,200
in in a way we are doing that also in

00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:57,860
Italy by trying to be an example in

00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,990
Europe and try to put it as a reform

00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,389
point for all the other governments to

00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:06,110
try to see and enjoy because I honestly

00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:07,549
believe that not only Italian but this

00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,960
is a personal belief that not only

00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:10,880
Italian institutions should participate

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,380
in this kind of effort so that was

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,389
quoting before the French government has

00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:16,039
also released a very good open software

00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:18,830
which can be adapted and used in other

00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:20,960
countries so if we of course there will

00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:23,539
be some software which will be just for

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,299
a nation or just to comply with a

00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:28,730
particular law or just like a design

00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:33,409
choice so for example for the the web

00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:35,450
the web tool kits but otherwise there

00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:38,539
should be should be created I think a

00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:41,149
much more wide collaboration platform

00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:42,350
where where these things can go and

00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:44,120
evolve

00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:46,490
of course sometimes it's quite hard to

00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:48,529
just convince the management another

00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,049
problem that we have many times is well

00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:52,610
but if it opens open it up then it's

00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:55,130
less secure

00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:56,419
which is of course not exactly the case

00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:59,630
but then you need to talk them through

00:28:56,419 --> 00:29:02,720
it and and what we have seen working is

00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:05,659
that often best practices really help

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,549
and we try to apply them in our work

00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:08,990
also because it's not really nice to go

00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:11,480
to somebody and say well you have to do

00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:13,130
it anyways you know it's because I'm I'm

00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,200
the boss or I'm the one who is putting

00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:16,880
down the guidelines so it's always

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,010
better to convince them and to have them

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,779
who means that opening things up is a

00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:24,919
good way it takes a little bit of effort

00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:27,409
for example one of the things we try it

00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:30,950
first is to have the ticketing system be

00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:34,789
part we put on the open and I'm having

00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:36,950
like all of this work on and then you

00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:38,960
create a workflow and then you they're

00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:41,000
very very scared at first and then they

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,639
see that it's actually good and I start

00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,919
to receive a good quality contribution

00:29:43,639 --> 00:29:48,679
and another example is that with the

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:51,500
agencies called photographical which

00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:53,929
creates the the identity cards they have

00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:56,149
a middleware for reading the cards and

00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:57,860
so you could build your own application

00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:59,690
you could have it as an authorization

00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:02,919
mechanism for your office or a for a gym

00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:05,149
or for the buses but it was Windows only

00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:08,179
you managed to have it released as open

00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:10,010
source for the hackathon just two days

00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:12,710
before and during the hackathon somebody

00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:15,559
took it and converted it for imported to

00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:17,600
Arduino so now everybody could use just

00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:19,820
an Arduino and all the Italian citizens

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,010
not all of them because they need your

00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,480
ID card but more and more Italian

00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,919
citizens in the next ten years their

00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,830
rollout will be complete hopefully also

00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:29,960
sooner we can just create your

00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:32,090
authorization mechanism with that and so

00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,500
they so this is a real real good value

00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:34,820
and this is when they start to

00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,529
understand the power of open source and

00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:38,059
of opening things up because I think

00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:40,070
it's time to receive contribution we

00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:45,049
have the immediate feedback and so on so

00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:46,789
yeah best practices too short okay wait

00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:48,440
I just go in order because and I've

00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:50,630
tried to keep the answers short I saw

00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,610
some hands there since all of the time

00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:56,320
but I didn't see them anymore so we'll

00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:56,320
go one okay good

00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:03,670
a lot of talk I understood that's how

00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,410
make it more open source friendly not

00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:09,660
necessary hacker friend how do you

00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:09,660
bridge the gap we lively important

00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:20,380
okay so the question was about this is

00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:22,540
and this is more about open source and

00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,430
not about hacking what I can tell you

00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:26,250
the hacking part if I understand your

00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:29,200
question correctly is about the

00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:31,420
platform's which are open and let's say

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,130
an API first approach where all the

00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:36,220
government agencies and all the services

00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:38,080
are exposed first via API so you can

00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,730
build your own applications or this is

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,470
of course a very very broad answer

00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:43,660
because you get all kind of API is an

00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:45,040
all kind of system but to give you to

00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,720
give you an example the data analytics

00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,940
framework will collect all of their data

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,070
from all public administrations and then

00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,960
you have a central interface to analyze

00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:55,630
it and it's the only source of truth

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,040
because it's where like you get

00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,930
real-time feet it's not like an open

00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:02,380
data portal where somebody just got

00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:03,910
needs to go and upload a CSV file every

00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:06,820
now and then when they remember but it

00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:09,490
just like has live feed from the day

00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:10,930
light the day data directly and then of

00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:13,860
course depending on the access level

00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:16,990
policies you can go and analyze it and

00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:21,040
for all the datasets that are opened by

00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:22,960
low then you can just create your

00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,550
account or login and then you have a

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,080
Jupiter notebook with all of the data

00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,490
directly inside and you can do your

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,040
analysis and you can publish them for

00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:33,310
others to see so in this case if you are

00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:35,440
an activist or a journalist or citizens

00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:36,910
who wants to do some batch boarding you

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,150
can do it easily in this kind of

00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:42,670
framework the electronic ID card is

00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:45,070
another example where you can build your

00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:47,590
tools and end devices and authorization

00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:50,340
with that yes what can you think the

00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,340
last question very quickly

00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:58,200
okay please

00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,640
[Music]

00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,240
huh

00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:24,200
okay so the question were we will do

00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:26,060
that we will do that but in general yes

00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,660
article 68 is already working we already

00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,660
have examples

00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:44,189
