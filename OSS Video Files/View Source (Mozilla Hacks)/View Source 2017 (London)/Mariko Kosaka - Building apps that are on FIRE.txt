hi it's my microphone oh that's a good

00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:14,660
okay cool

00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:16,570
hi so this title will make sense soon my

00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,520
name is Marco that's my twitter handle

00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:23,300
as parts mentioned I'm based in New York

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,919
City and I'm not only I woke a Google

00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,020
office in New York City I also organized

00:00:24,919 --> 00:00:28,790
a JavaScript community in Brooklyn

00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,189
called Brooklyn Jaso if you ever in

00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:34,520
Brooklyn it's a monthly meetup you

00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:36,679
should definitely come but as much also

00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,399
mentioned I am a Google web developer

00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:40,370
relations

00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:42,769
I work as a developer of game so if I

00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:51,100
said that as a Google's web developer

00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:53,510
team you might be thinking yes and so

00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,539
yes I am going to talk about PWA

00:00:53,510 --> 00:01:00,859
progressive web app and I want to share

00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:03,440
what our idea of key W is because we

00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:05,360
introduced this idea of PWA and it's

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,090
interesting if I go to like a Google i/o

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,340
or like a general web conference the

00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:13,880
programmers conference and not the web

00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:16,579
they kind of get confused how what PWA

00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:20,420
is and they I get these questions like

00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:23,810
so what's the difference between PWA and

00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:26,240
building an Android app and to me it's

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,729
really clear that pwe is a website or

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,590
web application that is enhanced was

00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:37,100
many capabilities but we found the need

00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:39,320
to define what PWA is and what we come

00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:42,530
up was was the PWA is a web application

00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,750
that is fast integrated reliable and

00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,509
engaging and I promise that this is a

00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:50,090
last slide I will say P delay because I

00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:52,430
really want to talk about what it's like

00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:55,789
and what you need and what is available

00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:58,039
to make those fast integrated reliable

00:01:55,789 --> 00:02:00,710
and engaging experience and if you

00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:04,369
notice that yes it is intentional that

00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:07,880
we use fast intuitive very engaging to

00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:10,520
save fire so it's kind of a

00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:14,510
or like a tagline that we are using is a

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,130
PW is on fire but before get into the

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,220
progress of Weber up story I want to

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:22,250
share my experience of using internet so

00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,709
I started using Internet when I was in

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:28,970
fifth grade computers to look like this

00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:33,290
was monitor that big and in I grew up in

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:36,739
Japan so in Japan up back then in 98 99

00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:39,050
there was a Cinco 2 packet a unlimited

00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:42,739
packet so if you connect the Internet

00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:44,569
after 11 p.m. then the data was

00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:45,950
unlimited that's why the internet was

00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:48,650
really slow because everybody's trying

00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:51,290
to connect it but my dad made an awesome

00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,569
decision that learning your 5th grade

00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,580
daughter staying up until 11 p.m. and

00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:58,280
then connecting to internet was a good

00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,110
decision and he showed me how to connect

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,000
to the internet and you know he because

00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,110
it didn't cost him anything I was like

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,819
make sure connect to the internet

00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:08,989
lifestyle of a p.m. and then you can do

00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:13,360
what everyone likes but Stan the browser

00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:15,950
that I use was Netscape and so to me

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,930
looking so if you don't know Netscape

00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,910
when you access to a page in Netscape

00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,130
and when the site is loading which back

00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:27,680
then took a lot of time to load it would

00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:29,780
animate yeah so in the dark-- 11 p.m.

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,329
after a war i'm not supposed to be awake

00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:35,359
our own in front of a computer looking

00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:37,760
at the thing to me was very magical that

00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:40,459
like it felt like this internet is like

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,560
a like a portal to somewhere else and it

00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:46,820
was just a magical experience fast

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:51,590
forward many years our experience is on

00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:54,709
this like these phones and we use this

00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:57,769
phone in like very very busy environment

00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:59,450
and the phone internet using internet on

00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:02,780
the phone is integrated into our life

00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:08,359
it's just very important part of what we

00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:10,549
do so like the experience that the I had

00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:12,650
are very quiet sitting down in front of

00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:15,319
dedicated time without any distraction

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:18,470
changed and we need to really think

00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:21,030
about the good what is good experience

00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,890
for the mobile use

00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:26,490
the Internet and that's where fire comes

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:30,840
in and the first integrated reliable and

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:33,060
engaging fire I hope what fire mean is

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,600
that the fire that you kind of want to

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,160
gather around and looked oh so much the

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,980
mashmallows not the fire that the

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,320
garbage fire that you want to think was

00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,580
so I want to share then this is the

00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,700
stoker is kind of like a general

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:51,060
overview of what kind of things that you

00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:53,430
can do to make this experience so let's

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:59,790
talk about how to build a fire start

00:04:53,430 --> 00:05:03,390
with fast fast when people say fast the

00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:06,270
Internet is fast the website is fast the

00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:08,970
the speed of the Internet is a feat a

00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,340
part of it but I'm not going to talk

00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:15,270
about that but you know what kind of

00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:19,560
connection user has is a important piece

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:22,890
of the puzzle so you know the speed of

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,380
the Internet is how wide the band is and

00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:28,440
how cloudy what's flowing inside of it

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,140
is however as a web developer what we

00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,850
can control is what's on top of it

00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,419
so for example on the server latency

00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:39,390
like you can put cash or put your

00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:43,410
resources on CDN and make the response

00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:47,550
faster or you can optimize how you

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:50,880
deliver data to the client so I want to

00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:52,890
dig into this how and like a house the

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,560
the trunk transportation of the data

00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:58,260
part so we used to have what we still

00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,380
have thing called hypertext Transfer

00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:03,830
Protocol if you're using one point X

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,510
version then it goes like this so you

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:09,060
send a request from the client saying hi

00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,770
server I want this data and server

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,410
receives a request and say the key I

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,660
have that data 200 ok and then send the

00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,880
data back and then your client says okay

00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,760
I got the indexes you know now so I

00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,800
won't you know image for this thing and

00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,770
those connections goes on the modern

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,740
browser allows the browser modern

00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:31,320
browser allows it to have 6 connection

00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:34,800
at a time and this is why domain

00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:37,620
sharding and icon slicing and all of the

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,220
performance excellence in you only can

00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:43,320
open a six connection to your server and

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,120
it's all staggered like what you want

00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,430
wants you sex and the request you have

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,140
to wait until the data to come back or

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:52,260
the response to come back in order to

00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:56,099
ask for neck next data so minimizing how

00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:58,680
many requests you send is one trick and

00:06:56,099 --> 00:07:01,050
then also this morning nearly fast is

00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,450
another trick the newer version that you

00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:07,680
may be able to speed up this process is

00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:09,060
called HTTP two so HTTP to use

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,000
fundamentally different ways of

00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,430
transferring the data so it only opens

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,460
one connection between client and server

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:19,979
and inside of that connection it is

00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:22,590
multiplex so the client sends the

00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:25,530
request in chunks and then also server

00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:28,409
sends the data in chunks and it's kind

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:31,860
of it goes like hey so there is a things

00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:34,020
I need and it just client sends the

00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,479
request at a time or want more one

00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:40,289
occurs at a time but in the one stream

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:43,110
and you can hint to things like this is

00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:44,669
a priority resources for example if you

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,099
definitely know that you want in

00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:49,020
index.html and the other one you can

00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:51,300
kind of a hint that too and then on the

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,220
server side it will return the data

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,520
based on those priorities and the quest

00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:59,849
cue but client doesn't have to wait

00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,970
until once filed to finish you you will

00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:05,849
received different file files in

00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:10,320
simultaneously another thing is that the

00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:12,120
server can push the data so the song

00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,570
like a good use case of server push is

00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:18,539
index.html so as a index.html font so as

00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:21,270
a web developer who control server we

00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:24,210
know that when we define index.html and

00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:27,000
we define like icon face or font face

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:30,479
you definitely know that in order for

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,370
that site to work you need to deliver to

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,990
icon form at the time if you're using

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:37,169
HTTP one of the kind of a get request

00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,280
and response go up passing the data

00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:40,740
around

00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,599
client Lisa saying XHTML and then Lisa

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,000
index.html and I say ah

00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,600
I need those icon form so they request

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,089
another

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,430
however somewhere all that is our order

00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:52,380
the person who provided to indicate Sina

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,990
already knows that the application

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,060
definitely needs those font so you can

00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,940
kind of set it like well when you send a

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:02,910
index.html then you also pushed icon

00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,800
phone without the the client asking

00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:08,370
because you definitely know that it's

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,410
needed another thing that you can do to

00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,470
fast speed up this process of getting

00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:16,019
data is using something like cache and I

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:18,690
will get dive into a little more about

00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:21,240
the serviceworker later but you can kind

00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:26,370
of cache it on the client side and then

00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:30,389
access it faster so that was how to get

00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,470
the data from server to client and you

00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:34,110
know when we talk about front-end

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:36,660
performance what happens inside of the

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,910
browser gets talked a lot and that

00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,190
deserves a whole another talk that I

00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,940
don't have so I want to share one

00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:47,880
exciting API what I think exciting

00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:50,699
that will be very handy for you to

00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,279
control learning your application really

00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:55,620
fast and that's intersectional server

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,009
how many of you heard of intersection of

00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,920
server

00:09:56,009 --> 00:10:02,610
yeah half of them so that's awesome so

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:06,089
intersection observer is a new API that

00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:08,759
let you observe if an element is in the

00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:11,069
view or not and by default it's just a

00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:14,220
window so it's basically tell you is

00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:17,009
this element inside of users view but

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:19,380
you can also set a parent element so

00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:21,990
that you can things like in this case I

00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,790
have a div as a black box and then

00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:27,689
another div inside of it as a child of

00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:32,519
the black box to Deb that is colored and

00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:36,269
just like setting up very simple code

00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:43,050
like this three lines whoa technicality

00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:44,819
more to come to kind of get the

00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:48,329
information if that is in the view or

00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:51,300
not so you can use these things a lot

00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:55,380
because say you're building image heavy

00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:57,120
application you can into download image

00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,950
once that element comes

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,440
to the view and you don't have to

00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:03,300
download the ten name is is at the first

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,339
or something because you might not like

00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,920
you you you are not controlling users

00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:09,930
how how far they gonna scroll if they're

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,930
gonna get to that image you're not so

00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:15,089
this wall speed up the process a lot and

00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:18,089
the chrome dev summit I made a silly

00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:19,589
little up Eileen even to some API

00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:21,810
because like it's not just for

00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:25,200
performance I made this like a game

00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:27,270
prototype of a using intersection

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,020
observer so this one in this case the

00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:33,210
parent is in the the meteor and then the

00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,460
locket is the child and kind of like

00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:38,100
orbiting inside and telling that the

00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,779
rocket is not visible or visible and you

00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,970
know this is just a prototype I'm

00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:44,010
thinking like kind of like a fake

00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:47,670
collision detection and then building

00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:50,880
after the game so I'm really excited

00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:58,170
about those things so moving on to the

00:11:50,880 --> 00:12:00,839
next one I integrated is first start

00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,880
with what's on the home screen so

00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,860
integrated means that your web

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,790
application that lives inside of your

00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:10,020
web browser

00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:12,240
feels like native up you know very much

00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,850
integrated to the user experience that

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,520
you regular mobile user huts

00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:19,290
so in order to have your web application

00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,470
on your home screen which is the first

00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:25,110
bit of integrated right because you

00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:28,260
don't really necessarily open every app

00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:30,000
from the app whatever the delivery thing

00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,560
that you have on the setting you would

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,339
go through the home screen right so you

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:37,800
want to be there as to be integrated

00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:39,300
this has been one possible using just

00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,610
add to homescreen

00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,560
but this you are is kind of like

00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:46,350
embedded inside you have to open the

00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,180
menu box and then you have to go through

00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:51,959
those menu and then like add it to home

00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:54,839
screen or bookmark it legally and you

00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:57,060
have no control of where user is going

00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:00,450
to do CAMAC so if I were to bookmark

00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:03,060
Flickr as a Flickr developer you might

00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:05,070
want the user to bookmarked like a main

00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,950
portal page that everybody goes to after

00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:09,209
logging in but a user who is bookmarking

00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:13,050
it I might

00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:16,999
the bookmark you know my one picture

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:19,559
piece that you know not the portal and

00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:21,720
every time I click on the icon on the

00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:24,449
home screen I wouldn't go back to the

00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,069
portal but I go back to the one picture

00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:28,139
page and you have to do it I'm not a

00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:30,499
click so it's like as application

00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:32,850
developer you do not have a control or

00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:35,730
what kind of things that would launch

00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:38,839
from the screen and that's not good

00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:42,389
that's that's not integrated feeling so

00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:45,300
whether the manifest is here to solve

00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:47,910
solve that issue so web app manifest is

00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:50,550
a single piece of JSON file that you can

00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:53,550
include in HTML in order to hint the

00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:55,769
browser what to do with the situation so

00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:58,139
you can specify things like short name

00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:00,629
which will be used under the icon when

00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:02,459
you save it to home screen and of course

00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:06,119
the size of the icon and what kind of

00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:08,610
icon to use if you have you if your

00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:10,410
application have manifestation then when

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,050
you load up from the home screen the

00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:15,179
browser will create a special page based

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:19,319
on the icon and name and background

00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:21,569
color you specify the issue or you don't

00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:24,569
know what kind of page would open up

00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:27,689
when user tap on the screen or the tap

00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:29,670
on icon will be solved with start URL so

00:14:27,689 --> 00:14:32,670
as an application developer you can

00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:35,189
specify ok on start of this web app

00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:38,819
please go to you know I don't know slash

00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:41,579
portal or slash profile or index.html

00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:44,879
and you absolutely have a control over

00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:47,369
that you can also have a control of how

00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,470
to display your application so is it

00:14:47,369 --> 00:14:51,899
gonna open as a standalone app without

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,329
the URL bar or orientation so if you're

00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:56,249
making like a piano application or

00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:58,439
something you might want to open the

00:14:56,249 --> 00:15:01,019
application on a portrait mode not the

00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:02,399
vertical side because you need those

00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:05,699
interactions something so you can

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,129
specify those and in under this case the

00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:11,279
theme color that you use or used when

00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:14,610
the apps are on the draw mode so you

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:17,939
kind can kind of specify many things

00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:20,040
that feels like native up and this

00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:20,950
manifestation is supported cross browser

00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,920
hope

00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:26,230
WebKit is not so you still have to do

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,370
the traditional way of specifying

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:34,180
install and gonza once you have that

00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:39,070
manifest Jason then you this can be used

00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:42,520
to prompt to install so the now with

00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:45,160
this feature user doesn't have to click

00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,840
on the menu icon and then go to bookmark

00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,990
and then save it to the home screen

00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,730
but browser will ask user hey you use

00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:56,020
this application a lot do you want to

00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:59,200
save it to home screen and browser will

00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:01,270
use these three signals to decide

00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,100
whether to prompt that or not so first

00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,500
is web app manifest kind of makes sense

00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,390
you need those data to save it to the

00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,480
home screen of what kind of icon to

00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:12,220
choose and what kind of text to display

00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,260
it needs to have offline support with

00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,560
serviceworker which I will get to you

00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,190
later

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,680
but this is just so that when user opens

00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:23,830
your application without internet

00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,840
connection it to guarantee that user

00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:28,210
will get something and not the offline

00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:31,060
dinosaur and feels like eller right so

00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:34,210
and then engage user this is the metrics

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:37,030
that keep browser vendors keep

00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:40,480
experimenting but it's basically like

00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:43,390
determining it's basically so that it

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,810
doesn't trigger the first load when user

00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:49,240
doesn't know if it's good app or not

00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:52,210
another one I want to share a few other

00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,370
API is not just to home screen that

00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:56,590
feels like integrated and feels like

00:16:54,370 --> 00:17:00,610
native app first one is payment request

00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:02,110
API so the first payment request API if

00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,240
you worked on e-commerce you might have

00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:07,209
done like many form validation and how

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,970
to like keep the user engaged to fit

00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:13,959
finish the checkout line with Spain and

00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:16,420
request API browser the application

00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,120
developer will only need to specify what

00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:22,240
kind of information you need and the

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:25,000
model provided by browser will pop up

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,949
and whatever the payment method that

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,770
user is installed on the phone will be

00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:32,890
as option so it kind of drastically

00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:34,370
minimize the fliction of filling out the

00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:37,909
form and checking out

00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:39,350
so that's kind of amazing and the mod I

00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:41,870
want to make sure payment request API is

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:44,659
not like a painting collection API it's

00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:47,059
just for you to get the data you need to

00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:49,130
send it to a payment collection services

00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:51,860
so like if you use stripe then you

00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:54,710
request the data that you need to

00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:56,960
process your stripe payment and then you

00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:59,210
have to process that payment this is not

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,029
a Google paid API or anything this is

00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:06,140
open standard that you can use with any

00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:08,330
other payment collection services the

00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,809
next one I'm really excited is WebSphere

00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:16,130
so web share let you share the data from

00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:19,220
web application to native up you write

00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:21,169
very simple code like navigator dot

00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:25,539
share and what kind of information you

00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:29,659
want to share and it will be saved to

00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:32,330
see yep it will open up a share drawer

00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:35,240
and then you can see that now the link

00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:39,350
is saved to Google keep so you can kind

00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:42,140
of send the data to native app another

00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:44,240
one is mediasession api which i if you

00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:48,409
do a media apps that's kind of exciting

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:51,140
so and it used to be when you own even

00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:55,899
you have a media up this is only thing

00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:59,120
that you get and this is like ok but as

00:18:55,899 --> 00:19:02,179
like just adding those things like a

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,809
metadata will make the experience a lot

00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:08,419
more rich and a lot more native feeling

00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:12,080
with thumbnails and informations and

00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:13,610
there are many many things that you can

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,750
do with media session api that we

00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:20,240
documented on our developer portal so

00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:22,690
the third one is available and deniable

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:27,110
means that were clear ability like a lot

00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:30,080
opens up something whether or not the

00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:32,210
app is online offline so even in the

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,669
case of life I which I'm at the moment

00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:38,720
on the life I because my phone is from

00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:41,990
us and even though it says LTE it feels

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,210
very slow it needs to the web

00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:45,389
application should load right like I

00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:49,139
don't

00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:51,239
if that I have a I have a feeling that

00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:54,239
the native up will always open whenever

00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:56,339
if I'm online or offline but I also have

00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:58,229
this like bad bad feeling that the web

00:19:56,339 --> 00:20:00,839
application will not open because it

00:19:58,229 --> 00:20:03,509
means the connection and the reliable

00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:05,729
experience will mitigate that part

00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:08,339
this section is entirely dedicated to

00:20:05,729 --> 00:20:11,009
service workers home thanks to take over

00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:14,129
for this slide how many of you know

00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:16,769
Fabrice Walker's how many of you have

00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:20,459
coded service orders how many of you

00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:23,729
know what it does so like I don't need

00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:25,589
to really do this job so I want an

00:20:23,729 --> 00:20:27,989
instant so there's a whole bunch of

00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:31,200
talks that our team put together about

00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:33,749
Service Worker and you can lead those

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:39,989
things if you really need a code sample

00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:42,690
but I wasn't really sure how much

00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:44,969
knowledge that you have and how much I

00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:47,429
should share if it's repeated or not so

00:20:44,969 --> 00:20:51,329
I decided to share my take on what

00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:53,700
Service Worker is which started eight

00:20:51,329 --> 00:20:56,099
months ago when I realized that I have

00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,889
no idea what Service Worker is so I

00:20:56,099 --> 00:21:03,179
wrote a picture book and I would like to

00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:05,339
share with you so in the galaxy very

00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:07,219
near to your palm over hand inside of

00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:09,419
this phone there is a planet browser

00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:11,549
inside of the browser you might be

00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:13,499
familiar was there what kind of element

00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:17,009
is in that browser or when the garbage

00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:20,459
collection happens this browser connects

00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:22,200
to a server galaxy to get data using

00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:24,899
things called hypertext Transfer

00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,479
Protocol if I see it and visualize it

00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:30,179
like this it's so cool and it feels very

00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:33,929
futuristic but in fact it is just a

00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:36,539
series of pipe leaving the data so the

00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:39,209
size of the pipe and the flow how clog

00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:41,879
the pipe is determines how fast the

00:21:39,209 --> 00:21:44,909
browser can get data and depending on

00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:47,999
where in the orbit this planet is this

00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:50,269
the pipe size may change the length may

00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:51,799
change it might be broken

00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:54,859
in the case that the pipe is not

00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:57,499
available but ran and returns itself to

00:21:54,859 --> 00:21:59,959
the age of the dinosaur you know kind of

00:21:57,499 --> 00:22:03,049
luminescent of no technology are and

00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:06,799
just like turns into total non-working

00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:10,969
things serviceworker is a thing to help

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:13,969
this situation to in order to make the

00:22:10,969 --> 00:22:16,279
browser feel like an up so serviceworker

00:22:13,969 --> 00:22:19,129
sits in between the hyper disk for

00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:22,639
protocol the network and the browser and

00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:25,489
the browser requests resources all

00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:28,279
requested HTTP requests through service

00:22:25,489 --> 00:22:31,159
worker and service worker can control

00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:33,559
how to handle those requests so in this

00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:35,779
case browser is asking hey I want to

00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:39,019
catch if and it service worker checks

00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:41,239
the network and ok ah and above my head

00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:43,519
there's no internet right now so I'm

00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:46,609
gonna return that from the cache that I

00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:49,849
serve before another thing service

00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:54,619
worker can do is handle the background

00:22:49,849 --> 00:22:56,719
fetch button so things like browser can

00:22:54,619 --> 00:23:00,139
Nick was like hey I have this cat photo

00:22:56,719 --> 00:23:03,139
oh it's offline can you just like handle

00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:05,809
that I'm gonna go sleep closed on the

00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:07,459
phone but then once the internet comes

00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:09,499
back above your head can you just found

00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:11,749
or uploading that so I was working to do

00:23:09,499 --> 00:23:15,259
that another thing serviceworker can do

00:23:11,749 --> 00:23:17,629
is a push notification so even if the

00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:19,759
browser is closed on their phone so

00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:22,099
every smoker can wake up to send a

00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:25,219
notification you know and then wake up

00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:28,059
the browser so that's a little bit of a

00:23:25,219 --> 00:23:28,059
texture hook

00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:36,800
this was written when I was leading J

00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:38,809
Courchevel documentation about Service

00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,690
Worker and the first line it's that was

00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:43,550
Service Worker is a programmable proxy

00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:45,640
or network proxy or something and I was

00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:50,000
like I have no idea what the sentence is

00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:51,800
I draw it so now that you kind of know

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,140
what service worker does here is a few

00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,120
strategy to handle the service worker in

00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,160
a park likewise the first one is cash

00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:09,050
then following back to network so this

00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:11,809
is kind of simple that you yep yep so

00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:13,730
you like the questa lease or C Network

00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:17,150
and once it fails then it goes back to

00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:19,220
your cache however this mission it has a

00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:21,230
little floss like if the network

00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,540
requests when it goes is like really

00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:26,059
slow and slow to respond then user have

00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:28,520
to wait because in order to go fallback

00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:30,250
to cache the network has to respond

00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,020
something and that might be really slow

00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:36,410
another one is a cache then network

00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:37,730
strategy it basically takes the old

00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:40,340
stale data first

00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:42,380
while the you are trying to attempt a

00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,390
new data from network and once the new

00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:48,170
data comes back from network then you

00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:50,210
swap it this is really good but you have

00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:53,059
to kind of make sure that your you are

00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:55,640
is not bothersome you you don't want the

00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:58,190
user to show a page with read a

00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,740
beautiful design and then just because

00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,920
you did Lee knew all the site you don't

00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:05,270
want to have interrupted users that is

00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,030
already interacting with your old

00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:11,809
interface with a completely different

00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:13,640
auu UI once you update it so it's you

00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:16,550
have to be very careful you can do

00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,470
things like update a leaderboard of the

00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,660
game or like insert a new article on

00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:22,610
your media page but you have to be a

00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:25,760
little careful about how to update those

00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:28,490
information the generic fallback is kind

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,320
of like you know go to cache and then go

00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:33,800
to network and then if both of them

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,590
fails then kind of show the default

00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:39,410
sorry you were offline page so in the

00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:41,510
case of Guardian the new site the data

00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:43,789
being fresh is really important but also

00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:46,159
they wants to keep the users while

00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:49,100
offline so they show a closed word

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:52,850
puzzle if as a generic fall back when

00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:54,830
network and the cache fails and once the

00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:57,139
internet comes back then they would ask

00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:59,330
you like hey you seem to be back online

00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:01,519
do you want to keep playing the game or

00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:04,789
do you want to load the content so while

00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:06,470
user is offline they didn't lose the

00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:10,009
users attention you kept the users

00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:11,989
attention by playing the game and once

00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:15,859
the network comes back you can load it

00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:18,470
up so this seems very complicated our

00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:21,289
team works on the library to help you do

00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:23,389
this because something some something

00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:25,039
like icon you want to use one caching

00:26:23,389 --> 00:26:26,989
strategy something like content you want

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,369
to use the other caching strategy and

00:26:26,989 --> 00:26:31,369
writing serviceworker core to gets

00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:33,139
really complicated so we have a kind of

00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:36,649
library to help you do that called work

00:26:33,139 --> 00:26:38,840
box yes and which will declaratively

00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:41,450
define what kind of caching strategy you

00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,759
want to use I want to go into last one

00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:46,279
which is engaging and in this case I

00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:48,109
want to talk about push notification yes

00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:50,679
the push notification that you might

00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:50,679
know as this

00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:56,929
so with serviceworker and with new api

00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:59,119
the web browser can use a push

00:26:56,929 --> 00:27:01,580
notification on the phone but it is

00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:04,429
known to be kind of annoying and it's

00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:07,940
also a bad news if you do those annoying

00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:11,179
interaction and user blocks you will

00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:13,519
never be able to ask us to send a push

00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:16,279
notification again because user once

00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:19,070
said it block and browser says oh this

00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:22,279
user says block so the community

00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:24,169
developed a pattern to avoid this called

00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:27,919
double permission pattern so basically

00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:30,379
what it is is a first it is a model that

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:33,679
doesn't actually prompt the push

00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:35,749
notification it asks you like hey do you

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,539
want to get push notification and then

00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:41,210
when users is yes then trigger the leo

00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:44,119
push notification that came up on the

00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:48,830
browser's one so that to ensure that

00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:50,629
user will not block because once user

00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:53,149
click on block you cannot come back

00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:54,470
later I want to share how weather a

00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:55,929
channel does this not the double

00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:58,690
permission pattern but I think it would

00:27:55,929 --> 00:28:01,119
channel has like a really good way of

00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:03,909
asking for push notification first they

00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:05,980
put the permission to the contextual and

00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:08,529
user initiated page so you have to go

00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:11,350
into settings page and your user is in

00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:13,029
the mindset of I want to set and you

00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:16,899
know think about push notification and

00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:19,029
then user goes select those and then

00:28:16,899 --> 00:28:20,860
triggers the push notification which in

00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:23,710
this case because the user initiated it

00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:28,029
there's like no surprise that they will

00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:31,659
allow it right they not likely to block

00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:34,240
it and then and once that's done then it

00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:36,909
gives the user options to disable it as

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,029
well and this one gets really important

00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:43,629
because add to homescreen or install but

00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:46,539
I was totally later is kind of like a

00:28:43,629 --> 00:28:49,029
bookmark so when you delete that home up

00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:50,769
to home screen I gone on the phone that

00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:52,600
will not delete a cast that will not

00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:55,690
delete that push notification settings

00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:58,990
so you really need to provide users in

00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:01,149
order to control those things too

00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:04,509
a lot of the UX studies are done and

00:29:01,149 --> 00:29:06,519
shared on the team site so lastly was

00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:09,279
I'm over time but quickly I want to go

00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:10,419
through the secure experience the things

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:14,970
that I've been talking about the

00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:19,419
powerful API is it all acquires HTTP and

00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:21,850
if you know what HTTP and HTTPS it makes

00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:26,049
sense but I want to briefly explain why

00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:29,049
these nice HTTP so HTTP is like sending

00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:31,480
secret letter if you're doing non secure

00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:33,249
the legal HTTP it's like sending your

00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,169
data in flat and in the video life

00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:37,269
experience I always explain it as like a

00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:39,190
sending a postcard your mailman can

00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:40,419
video postcard and whatever the personal

00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:43,259
message that you were sending on the

00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:45,669
thing or the malicious attacker can

00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:47,259
intersect with your mail and then like

00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:50,200
maybe tried to change the message and

00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:52,179
this is a kind of real word explanation

00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,190
of HTTP like you don't know if it's

00:29:52,179 --> 00:29:56,909
changed by somebody else malicious or

00:29:54,190 --> 00:30:01,320
not and somebody might be yours dropping

00:29:56,909 --> 00:30:04,570
HTTP makes it encrypted but means the

00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,740
you and the person neutral status and

00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,750
data can

00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,910
d-did I explain it as like a magic

00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:13,290
sunglass that you need to wear to read

00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:16,480
those message and then the messages also

00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:19,330
have integrity of this is gentleman to

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,540
you coming from that person so in order

00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:25,620
to make it sunglasses a whole bunch of

00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:28,929
things happens our first encryption

00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:31,990
basics I'm super over time so I'm good

00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:34,929
browser but you do a we use things

00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:36,490
called public key encryption where you

00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:37,960
can only encrypt it with public key

00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,640
which you share with your counter

00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,040
partner and then you can only declare

00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,780
with private key which you keep it

00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:48,309
secretly so the creating this network

00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:51,550
handshake goes like this so you say

00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:54,160
client says hey I speak this kind of

00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:56,740
public key encryption encryption let's

00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,690
start HTTP connections and then the

00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:01,120
counterparts it's okay let's use this

00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:03,750
thing that this version of public key

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,660
encryption and here's my certificate and

00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:11,110
here's my public key then you use that

00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:14,200
public key that they provided to encrypt

00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:17,500
the master secret and send it back to

00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,450
the counter partner in this way you you

00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,820
and counter partner have a secret

00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:24,160
together the serial secret that you only

00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:28,240
can lead because you did it with public

00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:30,640
key encryption and once that's done you

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,220
can use those seed in to create the

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:37,090
special sunglass which then use it to

00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:39,910
lead those message if you're curious

00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:43,750
about how and why and how to juice fast

00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:45,880
HTTP and how ITT KPS and how to care

00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:49,690
about SEO and things there is a video

00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:52,000
from IO two years ago about this fasting

00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:55,750
HTTP in highly recommended so in

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,270
conclusion the old application was fire

00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:02,830
in mind but far in order to do the fire

00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:05,290
you need to be secure because HTTP but

00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:07,830
serviceworker for example you don't want

00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:11,230
malicious JavaScript living in your

00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:13,760
end-users cache that might be tinted

00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:15,500
with malicious attackers and

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,210
you know vilified as coming from you

00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,580
that's really bad for your bland and you

00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:22,600
can kind of understand why HTTP is

00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:25,730
requirement for those powerful ApS

00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:28,610
hopefully this was interesting and

00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:31,340
hopefully this gave you overview of what

00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:34,640
we think is a very engaging and nice

00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:36,750
user experience for the age of mobile

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,890
Internet thank you very much

00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:40,890
