hi everybody it's great to be here Peter

00:00:06,729 --> 00:00:12,040
did an excellent job introducing me but

00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:17,650
I always feel I always like to introduce

00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:19,659
myself as well no dates so hi I'm Lia

00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,849
here's a fun fact you might not know

00:00:19,659 --> 00:00:24,569
about me I actually grew up in Greece

00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:26,380
and specifically in the island of Lesbos

00:00:24,569 --> 00:00:27,970
which technically makes me

00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:32,950
geographically lesbian probably the

00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:34,720
first you've ever seen seriously that's

00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,829
my islands claim to fame the word the

00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,100
lesbian

00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:40,300
it literally means someone from lesbos

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,190
so if you've heard my name before it's

00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,920
probably it might be due to my

00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:47,859
open-source work or maybe my standards

00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,480
work or my book if you have it I can

00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:52,239
sign it but I'm not here to talk about

00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,999
any of these so three years ago I did

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,399
something crazy according to some people

00:00:54,999 --> 00:01:00,640
at least in my environment I joined

00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:04,300
academia to do research and specifically

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:09,190
I joined the haystack group at MIT this

00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:11,830
is the website and I joined to do

00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:14,350
research on human-computer interaction

00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:17,380
which is kind of the fancy academic term

00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:20,680
for usability and the question I've been

00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,990
trying to answer for the last three

00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,760
years or so is how can we make web

00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,590
programming easier so even though I

00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,470
moved to academia I'm still working on

00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,330
the web and you might be wondering

00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,800
what's actually the problem here well

00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:35,890
what is this problem that you're trying

00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,990
to solve but I'm sure many of you will

00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,370
especially those that started with web

00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,830
development before you had other

00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:44,140
programming experience might be familiar

00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:47,020
with this people start by learning HTML

00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,300
and CSS and they can create stuff and

00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,880
yes there's always a learning curve but

00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,580
it's smoother they can immediately start

00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,740
creating useful things and yes the more

00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,420
CSS they learn the prettier it becomes

00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,640
or the more flexible it becomes

00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,680
but they can they can immediately put

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,050
something out there whereas when it

00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,550
comes to adding other common things

00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,259
they've seen on websites like maybe they

00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,060
want to store some data maybe they want

00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:12,040
to edit something on in write on the web

00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,300
site maybe they want add some

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,920
interactivity and suddenly they find

00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,520
themselves bombarded with all these

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:24,590
software engineering concepts and it can

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,720
be very frustrating and there are so

00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:30,200
many tools that keep coming out every

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,050
day and they claim to make web

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,980
development easier but it still feels

00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:38,900
like this to learn JavaScript today it's

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,090
indicative that there's this website

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,890
called to do nbc.com that compares all

00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,810
the popular JavaScript frameworks it

00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,750
implements the same to-do list with all

00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,910
of them and we've counted how many lines

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,340
of JavaScript within count HTML or CSS

00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:55,640
just JavaScript and just to make this

00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,350
very simple to-do list it takes hundreds

00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,780
of lines of JavaScript even with all

00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:02,600
these really high abstraction frameworks

00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:05,300
I recently came across this quote in a

00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,520
medium article and it resonated so much

00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,650
with me it says how the both workflow

00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,720
has been complicated by the needs of

00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,000
large web applications the these

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,040
frameworks tend to be designed by

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,430
developers working on large application

00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:22,430
for poor other developers working on

00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:25,250
large web applications and they they

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:28,280
they complicate things even more for the

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,230
usual developer or designer working on

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:35,750
like a small client web site or even a

00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:38,060
hobby project a few months ago I posted

00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,580
this poll on Twitter and I'm not aware

00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,459
of any more scientific data on this so

00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:46,840
which is why I'm using the this data yes

00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:50,930
it's a Twitter poll but it does have

00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:53,360
almost 4,000 votes so it does show

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:56,120
something so I asked hey people who

00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,350
write HTML and CSS how familiar are you

00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:03,620
with Java with JavaScript and only half

00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:06,020
of the respondents were actually very

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:09,770
comfortable with JavaScript the the rest

00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:11,660
ranged from not much to somewhat and yet

00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,700
all our tools are designed with the

00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:16,760
assumption that if you can write HTML

00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:19,130
CSS you can also write JavaScript which

00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,780
is not quite accurate it feels to me

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,539
that the landscape of creating on the

00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:27,080
web today looks like this on one hand we

00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:28,909
have vanilla j/s and frameworks that are

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,520
some are there are thin abstractions on

00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:33,020
top of Jas which give you all the

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,719
control you want you can build anything

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,909
with them but also they require a lot of

00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:40,759
knowledge and a lot of effort and on the

00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:41,930
other side you have prefabricated

00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,060
software that you install on your own

00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,159
server and you can customize if you know

00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:50,539
how to do that and it's built for a

00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:52,759
specific purpose like CMS's forums Q&A

00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:55,129
software there's all these all these

00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,870
scripts that you install on your server

00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:59,629
and they're built for a specific purpose

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,909
and they're kind of rigid to customize

00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:03,770
and on the far end of the spectrum we

00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:06,110
have services like Instagram or Facebook

00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,610
which hosts your data they provide you

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,440
existing interfaces you don't have to do

00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,840
anything but you also can't do anything

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,669
you can't customize them in any way and

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,120
that room is nothing in between

00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:19,639
there should be there's a lot of people

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:23,060
that can write some HTML and CSS but

00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,770
they're not programmers and the thing is

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,300
if you ask these people you might be

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,120
wondering okay if they want to create

00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,620
they can always learn programming but if

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,360
you if you actually talked with these

00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,930
people if you talk with these people

00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,449
which we did you'll find that they all

00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,879
have things they want to create all

00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:42,319
sorts of custom data needs like some of

00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,599
them are more common like creating a

00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,389
portfolio but others can be very niche

00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:50,479
like managing horse feedings I didn't

00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:52,129
make that one up it's a real case but of

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,930
course the only difference like

00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:56,089
creativity is a basic human need

00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,830
everybody has everybody wants to create

00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,960
everybody and everybody has data to

00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,150
manage and share the only difference is

00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,830
whether they can actually do that some

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,289
of them know programming and they can do

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,419
that today and others can't and many of

00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:11,180
you might be thinking well I'm a

00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:13,279
developer I don't really care but the

00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,400
thing is if you make something

00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:18,589
accessible to novices it becomes easier

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,080
for everybody think of when we have new

00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:24,289
HTML features for example think of when

00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,000
we add a deranged slider to be able to

00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:28,639
do like sliders natively without having

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,680
to include scripts or code it ourselves

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,659
everybody uses that now unless they're

00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,310
worried about browser support but in

00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:36,080
terms of usability it's so much better

00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,969
for everybody even for people who can

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,080
actually call the slider from scratch

00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:46,190
why would you do that today

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:47,990
so we started from HTML there are

00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,310
several reasons for that we've noticed

00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,430
that even people who are not very

00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:55,100
technical they can still learn some HTML

00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,860
they don't find it as hard as learning

00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,140
to program and there are some reasons

00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,400
for that HTML is very forgiving you

00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,130
don't have the experience of like

00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,260
forgetting a semicolon and it complains

00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:08,420
then you forget a closing parenthesis it

00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,860
complains again like this is a very

00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,850
frustrating experience when people are

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,360
trying to learn the traditional

00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:16,610
programming language like they it it's

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,350
hard to keep punctuation as strict as is

00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,870
required by these languages when you're

00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,550
learning and they keep stumbling on

00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,920
errors and this can discourage a lot of

00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,480
people whereas with HTML you can screw

00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:30,170
up as much as you want and the browser

00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:33,110
will do something with it also HTML

00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:36,170
fails gracefully if you make a mistake

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:38,630
it shows something it's not like XML for

00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:40,720
example where if you make a mistake you

00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,790
just see an error message or like

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,710
JavaScript where if you make a mistake

00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:47,300
everything breaks like many other

00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:50,840
languages are like that they're very

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,680
strict also it has a small syntax and I

00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,920
know some of you might be thinking

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,350
what's more syntax there's a ton of tags

00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:00,320
but actually the syntax itself is very

00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:03,350
small all you have to learn is angle

00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,810
brackets they mean an HTML element

00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,640
element how do you declare properties

00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,170
like what's the syntax book sorry

00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,960
attributes what's the syntax for that

00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:14,090
you use an equal sign for the value like

00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,860
use quotes that kind of thing like

00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:18,350
that's something you can learn in an

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,840
hour actually less than an hour probably

00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:23,570
and then all you have to do is look up

00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,600
what HTML element do I need for my case

00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,760
what attributes do I need but you know

00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,320
how to proceed whereas when when what

00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,000
you need to learn is more syntax you

00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,310
don't even know what to Google for and

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,990
usse we've seen this a lot in languages

00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,840
that are novice novice friendly like

00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,760
HTML CSS as well at once you learn the

00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,410
basic syntax all you have to do is

00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,390
search what property do I need what

00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:46,520
values does it accept and yes there are

00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,500
lot and lot and there are lots and lots

00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,630
of properties and yes CSS has become

00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,730
harder than it used to be but at least

00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,690
you have something to search for same

00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,970
with spreadsheets

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,129
well there's tip X itself is very small

00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,560
it's just functions once you know how to

00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:02,300
call functions that's it and all you

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,850
have to do is search what function do I

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,649
need so we wanted to have something that

00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,540
also has small syntax and large

00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:12,350
vocabulary large vocabulary is fine it's

00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:14,839
searchable and also HTML is portable

00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,220
it's not just like all web languages but

00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:18,560
not every language is portable for

00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,930
example this was Visual Studio languages

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,870
depend on having visual studio installed

00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:26,779
whereas with HTML it's an open standard

00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:29,660
it works on every browser so actually

00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:32,689
what we decided to do is extend HTML

00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,800
itself many people already know HTML why

00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:35,839
would they have to learn another

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:41,449
language just to create web applications

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:43,250
so we call their language mobile and the

00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:45,649
primitives the the building blocks we

00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,360
based it we based it on where things

00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:49,759
that we saw people were struggling with

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,290
they were trying to do them and they

00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,500
were having a lot of trouble learning

00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:56,649
the necessary JavaScript to actually

00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,319
accomplish them like editing data

00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:01,819
collections like having multiple

00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:04,459
multiple copies of the same thing with

00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:07,810
different data persistence storing data

00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:10,040
somewhere like why is this so hard today

00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:13,310
and not just locally on this on the

00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,019
browser but also remotely uploads like

00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:17,000
why is it so hard to make a website for

00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:19,220
a client and let them upload images

00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,130
right on the website it should be much

00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,139
easier or data flow like you have some

00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,420
data you want to transform it display it

00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:28,670
in a slightly different way so before I

00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,069
move on describing what Mabo actually is

00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,689
I want to make one thing very clear mom

00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:34,819
was just one answer to the question it's

00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:39,350
not necessarily the best it's the one

00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:41,630
we've we've been working on but the main

00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,339
thing is getting the dialogue going the

00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:46,130
main thing is that what's important is

00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:47,899
the question and many maybe if some if

00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:49,490
more people start thinking about the

00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:51,680
question if more people try to make web

00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:54,079
programming easier eventually we might

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,540
end up with something that actually

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,889
solves this problem maybe tomorrow maybe

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,009
it's something like mobile maybe it's

00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:03,800
completely different so you can play

00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:07,210
with more today all it takes is include

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,860
a JavaScript file in the CSS file but

00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:12,070
our vision is for maverick prototypes

00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:15,550
something like how HTML could look in

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:17,980
the far future like ideally our our

00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:20,560
ultimate visions that HTML itself will

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,940
eventually have pictures like this but

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,430
today you have to include a JavaScript

00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,470
or CSS in the CSS file to try it or you

00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:29,430
can go to Playmobil the item

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:31,800
so before I start describing the syntax

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,700
here's an example of a to-do list

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,500
because the to-do list is like the

00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:38,290
canonical example of any web application

00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,820
like every every framework every

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,320
language starts by showing you how to

00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,660
create it to-do lists and this is no

00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,810
exception so this is a to-do list

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:49,110
created with Marvel and try to guess if

00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:52,600
you had to guess how many lines of

00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:55,510
JavaScript do you think that took to

00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,100
write like how many lines did you have

00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,950
to write did somebody have to write to

00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:05,620
create a to-do list with Marvel not

00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:07,840
counting HTML CSS zero is the answer all

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,660
it took is this kind of HTML and of

00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:13,720
course some CSS to style it and actually

00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,370
most of it is part of the template the

00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,460
in the highlighted parts are the only

00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:20,790
parts that are marbled so if you're

00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:23,650
interested let's describe a syntax a bit

00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:25,360
you activate Marvo in a part of your

00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:28,750
HTML with the NP app attributed it

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,730
doesn't do anything by itself and you

00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:33,370
specify where your data will be stored

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:36,070
with the MV storage attribute and as a

00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,720
very simple value is local which saves

00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,580
your your data locally in the browser so

00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,740
you can refresh and it's still there but

00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,200
it's not very interesting what's more

00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,030
interesting is that if you if the value

00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,310
of every storage is a URL to one of our

00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,570
existing services that we support which

00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,690
can also be extended by third-party

00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:54,160
developers with plugins very easily

00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:56,050
right now we support github and Dropbox

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,720
so if you give it a github URL in ambi

00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,890
storage it automatically provides you

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,270
with the necessary

00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:09,730
login you I save you I all that you can

00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:11,770
see that in the video over there and you

00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,110
might be wondering okay so you specified

00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:17,920
where you want your data to be stored

00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:20,050
but what is actually stored so the

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,370
answer to that is Elliman

00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,899
through the property attribute and

00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:26,140
depending on the element Marvell knows

00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:30,459
how to handle it so for example here if

00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:32,920
I change this this edit field or the

00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:36,880
slider first off notice that there is a

00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:38,560
Save button now and it got highlighted

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,329
which means there's data to save and if

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,610
I hover over it it shows me what has

00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:47,459
actually changed and I can click Save to

00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:51,459
save it if I reload notice that the

00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:53,829
changes persist and if you don't want to

00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:55,769
have to click on save you can also

00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:58,060
specify and then be able to say

00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:02,230
attribute now there's no Save button you

00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:10,570
don't need to do anything it's saved

00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:12,160
automatically so so far we've shown form

00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,810
elements but these are easier to handle

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,880
even if you were learning JavaScript

00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:18,279
what's more interesting is when you

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,170
apply the property attribute on elements

00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:21,640
that are not form elements so what

00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,130
happens in that case is that they become

00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,959
editable and notice that there's now an

00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:29,230
edit button here by the way all this UI

00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:32,620
is completely customizable this is just

00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:34,959
the default and let's look at what

00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,490
happens when you put it on an image so

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,079
in this case uploads are not allowed

00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,600
because it's local so where would it

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,279
store them so you just you can just

00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,870
change the URL of the image but if it

00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:46,510
was github you would also get UI to

00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:48,490
uploading your image or if you put it on

00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,770
a meter I can hover over the meter and

00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:54,450
change the value on a date I get a date

00:14:50,770 --> 00:15:03,750
picker on a heading I can just change

00:14:54,450 --> 00:15:08,770
the name I even have a picture for this

00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:10,570
yes so depending on the type of the

00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:13,990
element mauville knows how to make it

00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:16,570
editable in different ways and let's

00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:19,240
look at a list of hobbies for example

00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:21,670
I've given it a property attribute so

00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,880
it's editable I can change it to

00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:33,240
something else and I could even add

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:33,240
multiple of this and do this change them

00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:41,280
and now they're all editable but you

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:44,100
might have noticed something okay I can

00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,690
change them to something else that's not

00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,990
very useful what if I want to delete

00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:51,240
some what if I want to ban some like the

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:55,050
interfaces were used to using on the web

00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:57,810
also allow us to do that so you can

00:15:55,050 --> 00:16:01,890
accomplish that with an MV multiple

00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:05,310
attribute and Marvel just adds the

00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:11,910
necessary buttons and controls to create

00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:17,070
new items which are also editable and I

00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:22,920
can delete items or I can undo the

00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:24,270
deletion I can rearrange them and I

00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,720
didn't have to do anything for that

00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:29,570
besides add an HTML attribute and this

00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:34,920
can be much more complicated than just

00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:43,080
one one piece of text for example let's

00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:45,300
turn this into a collection like that so

00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:53,700
notice that now I got an ad cut button

00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:56,670
which I can use and I can actually add

00:16:53,700 --> 00:17:03,480
Tim berners-lee as a second item instead

00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:05,820
of having to edit my first one and I can

00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,360
even I can even include collections

00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:13,370
inside other collections like let's try

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,370
this here let's add a hobbies collection

00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:30,970
so I haven't saved my data that's why it

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:36,610
returned back to just having one item so

00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:39,659
and I haven't added and be multiple so

00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:43,929
notice that now I have two collections

00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:46,000
and by using MB multiple attributes

00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:48,370
inside other MV multiple elements you

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,470
can actually create very complex schemas

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:54,159
that with the traditional approach would

00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:57,159
require a lot of a lot of programming a

00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:59,649
lot like maybe a sequel database on the

00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,809
back end whereas here all it takes is

00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:03,580
just designing your HTML as if it was a

00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:07,779
static website and adding a few

00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:09,220
attributes and but just by using these

00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:11,409
very simple primitives that I've shown

00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:14,020
so far you can already create like an

00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:17,649
editable homepage or like an editable

00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:21,520
portfolio website this is an example of

00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:23,169
an painters portfolio these are actually

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,090
my awesome cousins

00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:30,000
jewels paintings I think she's great and

00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:34,090
you can also see how image uploads work

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,190
over there it shows how you can upload

00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:37,659
an image by paste by pasting something

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:41,529
by copying an image from somewhere else

00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:48,429
and pasting it or by uploading it or by

00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:50,260
drag-and-drop this is my list of talks

00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:52,149
which was actually the very first mobile

00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,770
app ever created this was the thing that

00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:55,480
kind of motivated me to create Marvel

00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:58,299
because I started by copying and pasting

00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,919
HTML and after like a few talks this

00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:01,990
became very tedious I was like I need to

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,090
write some code to do this so I got some

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,190
custom JavaScript code and it was like a

00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:08,049
few hundred lines and I still had to

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,090
edit Jason plodding you talk so I kept

00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:13,020
delaying to add new talks until pretty

00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:15,909
much until I had given the talk already

00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:19,299
it was very tedious and now all I have

00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:21,909
to do is just click at it this is an

00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:26,530
example of a contacts list with like

00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:28,780
image uploads however sometimes you also

00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:30,700
you don't just you don't just edit data

00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,650
but you also want to display the same

00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,620
data somewhere else

00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:37,020
potentially even transform it which is

00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,700
what the bracket notation does so here

00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:42,330
notice that I'm changing the slider and

00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:45,270
the value updates in real time I could

00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:47,370
also do math with it here I've divided

00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:51,930
it by a hundred and I could also use

00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:54,500
that in attributes so how many of you

00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:56,490
were here during chrises talk and

00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:00,720
specifically the part about variable

00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:02,670
ponts raise your hands most of you

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,770
excellent so I'm going to show you how

00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:06,770
you can make a demo for variable phones

00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:19,770
let's make the font bigger oh not on the

00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:20,309
slider that's why it wasn't working okay

00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,980
excellent

00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:25,410
this is ski is kind of an ugly font but

00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,900
it has the advantage of being a variable

00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:33,570
pointed ships with OS X by default and

00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:36,690
we can use the font variation settings

00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:43,260
syntax which is yes it's awful but it

00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:45,809
works and notice that three gives us a

00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:49,220
really bold font two gives us slightly

00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:54,179
less bold and so on so I'm gonna use

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:55,830
strength here divided by thirty because

00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:59,160
the slider goes from zero to a hundred

00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:00,600
and I'm also gonna change this to 30 so

00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,620
I can see what I'm what value I'm

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:08,880
actually using so notice that now I

00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:12,980
change the slider and it modifies the

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,980
way the weight of the font very smoothly

00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:27,470
thank you and by using the same idea you

00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,150
can make a color picker here I've

00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:31,520
actually named my expression these

00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:33,500
brackets these things in brackets are

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,120
called expressions so notice that here

00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,860
I've named my expression and I've used

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,110
it somewhere else I didn't have to copy

00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:43,400
and paste it like I did with the

00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:46,550
strength divided by 30 before so by just

00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:49,010
using the simple syntax I've created a

00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:51,170
HSL color picker fully functional later

00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,580
so color picker and I could even I could

00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:54,260
take it even further and style the

00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,330
sliders as well with like gradients that

00:21:54,260 --> 00:22:02,150
also depend on the values of the other

00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:04,760
sliders so this is an even more an even

00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,870
more full color hsla color picker you

00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,450
can actually find it on the Marvel

00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:10,630
website all of these demo videos are of

00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,740
actual demos from the Marvel website

00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:14,120
this is when I was experimenting with

00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:17,330
the logo I wanted to try different

00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:19,820
variations so I made a Marvel that uses

00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:21,020
SVG with expressions in it so that I can

00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,880
explore different variations

00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,050
specifically angles and thicknesses and

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,640
see how it looks and different sizes

00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:31,970
this is a simple mortgage calculator to

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,410
show how it can do things like that

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:39,940
you're more used to using spreadsheets

00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:44,059
for and this is kind of a silly demo but

00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:46,280
I like how it shows that if you if you

00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:48,110
use it so my book has some predefined

00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,230
variables that start with a dollar and

00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:55,130
dollar now is one of them which you can

00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:56,960
pass in to a function a time function

00:22:55,130 --> 00:23:00,260
and it converts it into it this a

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,120
human-readable time and you can use it

00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:08,090
everywhere you can use a mob expression

00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:10,100
so let's try something how many of you

00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:13,490
have seen the scholar clock that used to

00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:16,640
be floating around raise your hand if

00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:19,340
you've seen this it had become bit

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,549
popular a few years ago so let's try to

00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:26,409
make a color clock

00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:31,450
I'm gonna specify a fixed XSL color all

00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:33,720
righty the property and let's try to see

00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:39,340
we need an expression that goes from

00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:41,259
zero to 360 so that the huge changes

00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:43,119
from red and cycles through all the hues

00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:46,480
we have so let's start experimenting

00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:49,210
first by printing out now which you see

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,889
is kind of a useless number you can

00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:52,210
divide it by a thousand attack it's

00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:56,649
actually the number of milliseconds

00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:58,960
since first of January 1970 so it's kind

00:23:56,649 --> 00:24:01,600
of a useless number by itself but if you

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,850
if you use math on it you can do useful

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,739
things so if we divided by a thousand it

00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,779
changes every second notice that the

00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:11,350
integer part of it changes every second

00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:16,330
and you can multiply it by six to change

00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:19,480
twice as fast six times as fast notice

00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:24,100
that now you get six different numbers

00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:26,679
per second and we can do mod 360 to only

00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:29,139
get the remainder of this number when

00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:32,980
it's divided by 360 and look at now that

00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:36,429
now we got a number that cycles from

00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:39,070
zero to 360 and it should go from zero

00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:40,929
to 360 in the span of a minute and now

00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:43,659
we could even we could either name this

00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:46,239
and use it in our in our style attribute

00:24:43,659 --> 00:24:50,859
or I can just copy it which is easier

00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:52,059
and if I let this running for a bit as I

00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:53,739
probably shouldn't cuz I'm running out

00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:56,109
of time but if I let this running for a

00:24:53,739 --> 00:25:01,269
bit you can see that the color should

00:24:56,109 --> 00:25:04,799
change do you see that it's a it's a

00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:10,330
completely useless demo but I love it

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:11,710
silly demos are the best and expressions

00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:14,379
become quite useful when they're

00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,549
combined with with collections remember

00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:18,789
collections are elements with and be

00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:21,970
multiple so for example I can count how

00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:24,100
many cuts I have here notice that it was

00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:27,159
first one as my data was loading and now

00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:30,490
it's five it updates dynamically like I

00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:33,030
can go here and add the cut and now it

00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:36,480
updated to six

00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:38,460
or I can count how many cats have ages

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,020
for example because I can refer to any

00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,880
property anywhere in the motto I don't

00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:44,610
have to think of like complicated paths

00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,890
and things like that or I can even do

00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:53,250
things like this count how many cats are

00:25:46,890 --> 00:26:00,000
older than six and you can see that now

00:25:53,250 --> 00:26:04,290
it's only two and if we have time well

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,500
we can do this very very quickly I have

00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:08,490
a demo for you if you have internet

00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,990
access

00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:14,929
well the Wi-Fi seems to be working quite

00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:14,929
well so visit this URL

00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:20,190
login with your github account I'm sorry

00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:23,370
that the permissions that asks for are

00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:25,200
very broad I can't ask for permissions

00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:29,370
just for a specific repo github doesn't

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,050
let me make some edits to the data maybe

00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:32,610
change some cat's name maybe upload

00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:36,059
maybe add your own card if you have one

00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:41,429
how many of you have cats excellent I

00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:43,620
like that people so maybe make some

00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:45,179
edits if if you don't have time you

00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:48,270
don't need to upload a photo you can

00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:50,429
just add a cat without a photo say and

00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:52,410
then click send that it's suggestion

00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:54,840
because you can also when you say it

00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:56,700
saves it in your own profile so you

00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,860
could have your own version of this of

00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,330
this mobile app with your own data but

00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,760
you could also click send that it's

00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:05,190
suggestion and send a suggestion to the

00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:09,750
original to the to whoever maintains the

00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:11,820
original model and that way you can have

00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:14,820
collections that like the public can

00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:17,160
update and that data and it can be

00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,870
moderated like you can you can moderate

00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,300
what suggestions actually get added

00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:23,760
sadly you can't moderate with the room

00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,679
arvo you can only edit the data through

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,090
Marvo and send out its suggestions and

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,980
you don't need to know anything you

00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:30,600
don't need to be technical for that but

00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,520
currently to actually approve the

00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,250
suggestions you need to go to github and

00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,230
look at pull requests and marriage a

00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:41,880
pull request so I'm going to do that now

00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:44,220
let's see if anybody has sent one yet

00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,660
how many have succeeded in sending one

00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:56,280
raise your hand when you do so I know

00:27:45,660 --> 00:28:03,419
that check yes we have one and I can

00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:05,700
preview the changes over here he added a

00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:09,950
cat called he or she added a cat called

00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:15,720
mr. Poulos and I can squash in marriage

00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:19,020
and now if i refresh here it should be a

00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:26,340
part of the data see Mustafa list has

00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:28,980
been added a few more demos this is my

00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:31,080
actual invoicing system of course not

00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,520
with that data but because you can

00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,250
change the data of every model through

00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:37,650
the URL I can just go to the app to the

00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:40,530
demo on the website change the URL load

00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:45,419
my actual invoicing data that's how I is

00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:47,370
you invoices also I've always found

00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:49,770
I love hunk coding SVG but I always

00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:51,929
found the the syntax for paths very

00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:53,549
complicated so I always wanted to write

00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:55,740
an app for this but I was too lazy

00:28:53,549 --> 00:29:00,289
whereas with Maya I was able to do it

00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:03,720
just with HTML and I can create paths

00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:08,280
visually like this of course it's a cat

00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:12,090
what did you expect it to be and you can

00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:14,220
find all these demos on the website this

00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:16,740
is another one this is my list of

00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:19,799
recipes we mean my partner like cooking

00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:23,309
a lot and this is also a demo of how you

00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:25,049
can do a multi-page web app with marble

00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:26,909
this is a separate page and when you

00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:28,650
click on this I'm not sure if you can

00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:30,690
you can't see it but it's it's a

00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:35,120
separate URL it's like poor Gazan home

00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:37,559
slash recipes last salmon teriyaki and

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:42,570
now it loads this part of the data and I

00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:44,190
can edit this part of the data and my

00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:46,620
book has been also made very extensible

00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:48,270
I if we just hard-coded all these things

00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:50,760
then it wouldn't be very useful right if

00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:52,290
it were example it just supported github

00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,510
in Dropbox and there was no other way to

00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,590
save data in an in a different service

00:29:54,510 --> 00:30:00,809
or on your own server

00:29:55,590 --> 00:30:03,029
that wouldn't be very useful but it has

00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:04,919
been it's very very extensible so that

00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:10,080
third-party developers can add features

00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:16,260
to it add more storage backends add more

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:19,770
formats all sorts of things and so so

00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:22,409
far I've been describing basically an

00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:25,080
open source project so what's the

00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:27,659
difference between developing an open

00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,640
source project and being in academia the

00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:33,500
difference is that you action the

00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:36,419
contribution is not actually the code

00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,700
you have to actually prove that you

00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:41,190
manage to answer the research question

00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,840
to some degree so remember the research

00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,520
question was how can we make web

00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,559
programming easier older or

00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:49,289
alternatively how can we make it

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:52,770
accessible to novices but have we done

00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:55,620
that we don't know until we evaluate it

00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:59,250
so how do you evaluate it in my field

00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:02,909
you do a user study so we recruited 20

00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:04,860
participants 13 were female identified

00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:08,730
as female six as male as and one as

00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:11,340
other this is their median age 13 were

00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:13,260
beginner worse in programming they they

00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:15,899
self-identified as beginner or worse and

00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:18,450
seven were intermediate and before they

00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:20,549
came we asked them to bring in a mock-up

00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:22,799
of a contact manager application without

00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:24,299
telling them anything about Marvell we

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,740
just wanted to see how they would write

00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,450
the HTML if they didn't know anything

00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,220
about Marvell we told them not to spend

00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:34,610
too much time on it like maybe 10-15

00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:37,350
minutes seven actually brought one so

00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:40,080
the the the general structure of the

00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:43,950
study was we would give them a tutorial

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:46,529
on Marvell syntax first then we had a

00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:48,510
structured part where we would show them

00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:50,909
a finished application without showing

00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:53,159
them any any of the code and then we

00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:55,710
would give them a CSS and HTML mock-up

00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:58,529
and ask them to write the map to add the

00:31:55,710 --> 00:32:00,690
mauville required for turning it into a

00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:04,590
fully functional application and at the

00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:06,450
end was the pre style study where we

00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:08,580
asked them to turn their contact manager

00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:09,149
application into to make it fully

00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:12,389
functional

00:32:09,149 --> 00:32:13,950
Marvel and the structured study the goal

00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:17,129
of the structured study was to see is

00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:19,019
Marvel usable is it Lerner ball can

00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:21,149
people use it and the free style study

00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:23,849
was to see if Marvel's capabilities are

00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:26,219
sufficient to actually turn the HTML

00:32:23,849 --> 00:32:29,039
that people actually write into fully

00:32:26,219 --> 00:32:32,249
functional applications so for the

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:34,169
structured study these were the two

00:32:32,249 --> 00:32:37,309
applications we showed them and we split

00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:40,379
the tasks into like 12 or 10 steps

00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:43,859
ranging from basic tasks like make up

00:32:40,379 --> 00:32:46,109
make this part of the website editable

00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:48,239
or turn it into a collection to basic

00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:49,889
expressions like things that required

00:32:48,239 --> 00:32:51,419
them to show the value of something

00:32:49,889 --> 00:32:53,729
somewhere else or count how many items

00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:56,070
there were and things like that and

00:32:53,729 --> 00:32:58,919
there were also such a few steps that

00:32:56,070 --> 00:33:01,889
were complex expressions like an average

00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,139
of averages or account with a filter or

00:33:01,889 --> 00:33:06,239
a conditional which whose goal was to

00:33:04,139 --> 00:33:07,950
test the limits of Marvel like we knew

00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:10,469
these were going to be hard but we

00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:13,769
wanted to we wanted to push it to the

00:33:10,469 --> 00:33:15,869
limit and see how people do so these

00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:21,509
were the two applications these are also

00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:24,659
available on the on the demos so you can

00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:26,999
see a thing a theme here so this is a

00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:29,369
decision making application where you

00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:32,279
weigh pros and cons that helped and it

00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:35,849
helps you make a decision and this is a

00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:37,409
foodie log where you can log your visits

00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:39,059
to restaurants and what you ate and what

00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:41,099
you thought of it and it calculates the

00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:45,149
rate the average rating for each visit

00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:46,889
and the rating of the restaurant so

00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:50,070
before the study we showed them these

00:33:46,889 --> 00:33:51,749
applications without any code and we

00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,129
asked them if you were given the HTML

00:33:51,749 --> 00:33:57,599
CSS how long do you think it would take

00:33:53,129 --> 00:34:01,830
you and five set hours and the rest set

00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:05,190
days weeks or months in in practice they

00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:07,289
did it in about half an hour and the

00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:09,419
results where all of them were able to

00:34:07,289 --> 00:34:11,069
carry out the basic crud tasks grad

00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:13,679
means create read update delete so it

00:34:11,069 --> 00:34:16,579
describes tasks like editing data adding

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,629
new items deleting things like that

00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:20,909
almost all of them were able to carry

00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:22,740
out the basic expressions tasks like

00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:26,220
showing the value of something somewhere

00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:27,930
counting items averages and one

00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:30,030
interesting things think that we noticed

00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:33,000
was actually their failures were all

00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:37,350
concentrated in cases where the variable

00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,770
part of an attribute or the content was

00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:42,780
not surrounded by whitespace it was not

00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:44,970
it was not visually distinct from the

00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,730
text that surrounded it but it was

00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:50,700
surrounded by other kinds of punctuation

00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:52,320
and surprised

00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:55,200
surprisingly that tripped up people a

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,400
lot and about three out of four were

00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,620
able to carry out the complex

00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,910
expressions tasks which we thought was

00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:02,670
quite good given that these were

00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:05,940
designed to push people to their limits

00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:07,980
but many people found conditionals hard

00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:10,880
we have an if function that takes the

00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:13,530
test as its first parameter and then

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,390
prints out the second argument if that

00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,400
test is true and that then the third if

00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:20,070
it's false many people found that hard

00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,810
especially when it was nested and some

00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:23,490
some of them even remarked that how it

00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:27,150
reminded them what was hard about

00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:28,860
programming so after the study we the

00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,090
markup based conditionals so that people

00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,950
don't have it to come into contact with

00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,660
that for every single conditional they

00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:35,610
need like four simple cases where you

00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:38,310
just want to remove an element from the

00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:42,810
from the page if a test is false you

00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:44,940
don't need to use that and the the

00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:47,550
perceived difficulty of creating these

00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:51,030
apps fell two points on a five-point

00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:53,190
scale and these are the details of how

00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:55,530
much it fell it apparently people

00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:57,870
thought the foody log was a much harder

00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:01,320
app to create initially but actually it

00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:03,420
was as easy as the decisions 1 and this

00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,250
is a summary for the pre style study

00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:09,120
these are some examples of the contact

00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:10,920
manager people made I mean we told them

00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:14,190
to not spend more than 10 or 15 minutes

00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:16,980
and most of them were beginner so that

00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:18,810
explains how they look but all of them

00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,340
were able to convert them to fully

00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:22,440
functional apps which was the point of

00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:25,200
the study and some of them even made

00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,730
their own apps and my favorites is this

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,310
 speeding up there was this

00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:31,650
participant that had her horse in a

00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:33,030
stable and it was really complicated to

00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,570
track like their blankets and their

00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,610
feelings

00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:37,650
all that it's a partly it's super

00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:41,190
complicated to manage horses and they

00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:43,260
had this table that they would erase and

00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:46,770
write on every day and she made them

00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:48,830
this app which I think they use many

00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:51,120
people remarked that Marvel was simple

00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:52,710
it was easy to learn but most

00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,330
importantly it did the things that they

00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:57,570
were having trouble to do which is

00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:59,520
exactly why we made it and we published

00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:05,610
the paper about this at an academic

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:09,180
conference called whist and before I

00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:12,660
finish the thickness that Marvel doesn't

00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:15,900
doesn't yet do everything we envisioned

00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:18,270
for it like the parts that are that are

00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,460
actually implemented are very very tiny

00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:22,710
bit of what we actually see for it there

00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:27,450
are many things we can't do so we have a

00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:29,430
lot of things planned for the future for

00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:30,690
example you can almost do this to-do

00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:33,900
list but you can't do the clear

00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:35,940
completed button so having custom data

00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:38,160
interactions is something I really I'm

00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,540
really looking forward to doing because

00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,970
right now you can only edit your data

00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,380
via them up the UI that Marvel adds and

00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:46,470
you can customize the UI but you cannot

00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:48,350
have custom data actions also granular

00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:50,970
access control like being able to add

00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:52,530
items and only edit your own items right

00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:56,340
now you can either edit all the data or

00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:58,050
nothing real-time apps like apps for

00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,450
example a chat app where you're the

00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:04,140
server also the the cloud service you're

00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:06,480
using also pushes data sorting filtering

00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,430
grouping and searching data data

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,700
exploration things like that actually we

00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:14,220
already have sorting we have someone

00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,440
working on it that just finished it

00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:19,460
and he's moving on to grouping now so

00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:21,420
that's sort of being already done

00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:23,490
pivoting let's say you have a list of

00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,780
restaurants with visits and foods what

00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:27,990
if you want to change it to a list to

00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:30,360
restaurants and which contains a list of

00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:36,120
foods and each food contains the the

00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:38,160
dates that you ate it on or having data

00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:41,430
that is not nested but it actually links

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,350
to other data or even beyond the browser

00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:46,930
like what about mobile apps or Internet

00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:50,660
of Things type a type of things

00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:53,840
so there's a lot to do and we're really

00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:54,980
excited about it if you want to get

00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,840
involved it's a free and open source

00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:59,930
project some github if you if you

00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:01,340
actually know JavaScript you can you can

00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:03,980
create plugins you can actually work on

00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:08,300
the core even if you don't you can help

00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:11,410
with documentation so that's about it

00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,410
