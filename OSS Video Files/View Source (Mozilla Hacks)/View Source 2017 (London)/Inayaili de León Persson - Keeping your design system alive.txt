hi my name is di Li like Peter just said

00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:13,740
I'm a product designer company called

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,310
make us proud which is a product design

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:21,480
studio based here in London very near

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:25,140
the beautiful Barbican right now I'm

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:28,349
working on a project with giant giant

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,740
our San francisco-based company they're

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,930
early contributors to no js' and they're

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,320
pioneers in the fields of cloud

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,270
computing and application virtualization

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,120
they're early adopters of software

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,730
containerization technology and before

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,190
they were acquired by Samsung last year

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,640
they were the largest privately owned

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,829
cloud provider in the world so we are

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,960
working with them on the new iteration

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,359
of the my joint portal which is also

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,359
called Triton which is an infrastructure

00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,730
management platform and we want to bring

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,470
application management into it which

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,680
will include things like deployment of

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:12,540
services and versioning alerting and a

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:15,350
lot more things before that again as

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,270
Peter just kindly said I used to work at

00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:21,900
canonical who are the company behind the

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:25,380
window operating system for quite a long

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:28,439
number of years and there I was leading

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,200
the design of the vanilla framework

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:36,210
which is used across all of the products

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:39,710
at canonical and all of the web sites so

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:43,729
just some housekeeping before I begin I

00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:47,520
am going to use the term design system

00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:50,579
throughout my talk because it's just

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,259
easier to keep to one term but that

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,780
doesn't necessarily mean that when I'm

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,270
saying that that I'm referring to a very

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,060
complex design system in the truest

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,009
sense of that term something that has

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,630
tone of voice and brand guidelines and

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,049
pattern libraries and all of that stuff

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,590
but it's just it's just a lot easier to

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,330
use to say design system throughout the

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,210
talk rather than call it very many

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,370
different name

00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:18,070
and for those of you that don't like

00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:22,660
that I hope you can understand my reason

00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:26,410
and you can forgive me for doing that so

00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:29,530
the title of this talk is keeping your

00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:32,680
design system alive and it was a bit

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:36,300
inspired by the Tamagotchi which was

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:44,890
this cute little device in the late 90s

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:46,630
did anyone here have a Tamagotchi so the

00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,910
time I got she had this little animal

00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,670
inside that you had to look after and he

00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:54,370
had to play with and you have to do

00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:57,130
several things and feed it to be able to

00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:59,500
keep it alive but then I decided that I

00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:01,600
actually was not kind of continuing with

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,720
that analogy any further because the

00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,370
time I got she's ended up being just

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,760
incredibly annoying and completely

00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:12,630
useless and I hope that your design

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,630
system isn't that

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,909
today I'm also not going to tell you how

00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:22,239
you should create a design system from

00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:24,400
scratch I'm going to assume that maybe

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,579
you already have one or you're in the

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,519
process of creating on my goal is to

00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:32,760
give you some ideas some tips on how you

00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:36,189
can make sure that once you do have one

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,739
it's properly maintained and how you can

00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:41,709
encourage usage and participation from

00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:44,980
your team and from other teams because I

00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:47,530
know that it's not easy at all to get

00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,930
the resources that you need to plan and

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,659
to create a design system but I think

00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:55,870
that it's even harder to to keep it

00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:58,090
alive once you do but if you do want to

00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:01,629
talk about how to get to this point you

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:04,389
can try to to grab me later during the

00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:12,700
breaks and I'll be happy to talk to you

00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:16,260
about that as well just in a second so

00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:19,539
tip number one is put someone in charge

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,430
so before you do anything else make sure

00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:23,760
that there is someone that is leading

00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,050
the project and you can call them

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,930
Project Lead you can call them an

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,880
evangelist a champion whatever you want

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,729
to call this person or this this group

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,820
of people their responsibility is to

00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:41,169
keep the design system alive and not

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:44,530
just alive but also healthy if you don't

00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:46,840
have someone that is responsible even if

00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:49,349
you really really want to maintain a

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,389
design system it's just not gonna happen

00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:54,220
everyone's always busy and everyone has

00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:57,010
other things on their minds and it's

00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:59,470
just incredibly easy for a project like

00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:03,280
this to go down and down and down on

00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:07,479
your on the priority list even though a

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,530
design system can save teams just loads

00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:11,440
and all the time

00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:14,520
in the future people find it really hard

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,380
to understand the need for this huge

00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,389
investment of time that is needed up

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,600
front and then that is needed to

00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:23,060
maintain it

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:28,370
and finishing and delivering other stuff

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:31,160
just tends to sound more important so if

00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:33,170
you think that everyone's gonna pitch in

00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,900
and everyone's gonna drive this project

00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:38,210
just because you really want to if you

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,220
should you should think again so this

00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,860
person will be there to make sure that

00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,080
the project is prioritized and that

00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,440
you're working towards the goals that

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:52,220
you've defined which leads me nicely to

00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:54,980
my next point by the way everything that

00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:57,590
I'm referencing here will be linked to

00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:00,500
in in the slides and in the slide notes

00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:03,970
so even if it doesn't have a link here

00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:09,200
it does somewhere else anyway

00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:11,540
so tip number two have a road map it's

00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,210
important that everyone working on this

00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,220
project shares a common vision so you

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,960
should start to think about where you'd

00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,850
like to be in three months or where

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,970
you'd like to be in six months or in a

00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:25,070
year and this shouldn't really be an

00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,540
overview of the tasks that you're doing

00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,340
on a day to day basis

00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,540
you know small things bug fixes things

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,780
that you're actually working on right

00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:36,260
now it's a more high-level view of what

00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:38,060
you want to focus on next to get to get

00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,250
something like this started you can just

00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,470
gather a few people in a room and you

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,810
can get everyone to write down in

00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:47,750
different post-it notes what they think

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:50,090
are key goals for your design system so

00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,010
they could be writing things like we

00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,230
need to have a website or we need to

00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:56,060
have a Twitter account or social media

00:06:54,230 --> 00:07:04,550
presence or we need to make sure that

00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:06,320
it's accessible or well sorry my I have

00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,640
a I have an app to tell me what I need

00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,970
to have a break and it's just told me

00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:13,330
that I need a break

00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:15,100
it might say it again in five minutes

00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:19,040
anyway

00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:21,260
so there could be things like we want to

00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,870
get 50 percent of the teams in the

00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,940
company to use it in six months or we

00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,370
want to have better documentation or we

00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:31,850
need to design primary and secondary

00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:33,500
buttons first and so on once you have

00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,729
this list once everyone is finished with

00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,389
this

00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:39,460
ask you can then start dividing things

00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:42,129
on the wall in maybe you can divide

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:45,069
things into Sprint's or in two months or

00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:50,020
into quarters or releases or however you

00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:53,319
think fits the way you work best this is

00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:57,219
the high level roadmap that we created a

00:07:53,319 --> 00:08:00,159
canonical for the vanilla framework it's

00:07:57,219 --> 00:08:02,199
it's actually a public Trello board and

00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:05,139
that anyone can go and see because it's

00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,969
an open-source project once you have

00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:09,159
something like this you can then refer

00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:11,710
to it

00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:13,240
- this prioritization regularly when

00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,610
you're planning the work and it will

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,309
make it easier to decide what tasks you

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,960
want to be focusing on next what's the

00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:22,180
most important thing that you should be

00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,710
doing next and what is less important

00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,559
and you don't have to spend time on now

00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:29,649
and these goals can change and these

00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:31,479
goals should change so you also need to

00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:34,240
remember to put in place some kind of

00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:35,949
mechanism like regular meetings that

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,529
guarantee that you're going to keep

00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:40,979
checking these and updating these once

00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:40,979
in a while

00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:49,120
tip number three is be open if you're

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:51,220
working on a design system I assume that

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,519
your ultimate goal is to get people to

00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:57,490
buy into it and to use it and I believe

00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,410
that this works better and this actually

00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:02,350
happens if you include people in your

00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:04,329
vision and you share the plans of things

00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:07,720
that are to come and if you're

00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:11,319
transparent about how new guidelines and

00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:14,079
components are added to your system when

00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:16,000
you're working really hard on a design

00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:17,139
system and the same for any kind of

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,170
project when you're working really hard

00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:22,930
it can become really really hard to

00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:26,529
listen to negative feedback but it's

00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:28,569
also it's very important to become a

00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:31,480
better listener and really try to

00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:34,029
understand any suggestions or any

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,589
comments that people are making is this

00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:37,630
something that we really need to improve

00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:39,010
or is it something that we need to think

00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,839
about adding

00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,370
because they're probably saying that for

00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:45,010
a reason and those are the people that

00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:48,010
you want to use the design system the

00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,769
target is probably not you so what I

00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:52,449
mean is that it's important to accept

00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:53,829
other people's ideas and not just

00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:56,320
dismiss them straight away and think

00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:59,800
that they're wrong so some more specific

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,410
ideas after you do the prioritization

00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,389
exercise that I just showed maybe you

00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,269
can share it with everyone you can open

00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:09,639
it up for feedback and maybe you can

00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:10,510
change things if people have ideas of

00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:12,430
other things that you might have

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,850
forgotten and add more things to the

00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:17,170
list or reorganize things a little bit

00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:20,380
you can also use tools that are more

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:22,329
inclusive so in the project that we're

00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:25,269
working on right now with giant we just

00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:27,810
started using figma instead of sketch so

00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:32,040
that anyone on linux or mac or windows

00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:34,870
can see your design files because it's

00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,149
it's a web-based app so you don't have

00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:39,730
to have anything installed to see a file

00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:41,500
to leave a comment on the file to

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:46,899
inspect the elements and see all the

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:49,389
properties also have discussions in a

00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:52,810
place where people can keep track of

00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:54,459
them like for instance github the the

00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,620
giant project that we're working on

00:10:54,459 --> 00:11:00,069
right now is all available on github

00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:02,889
publicly but this doesn't mean that your

00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:04,870
projects have to be public they can you

00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:07,060
can still be open within a restricted

00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:10,660
number of people you can be open within

00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:12,970
your company make time for discussion

00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,769
like having regular showing tails

00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,560
or regular critiques about any

00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:21,339
components that are open to more people

00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:23,560
not just the Design Systems team and you

00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:26,829
can also organize workshops to define

00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,440
and to name new components or maybe you

00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:32,199
can do things like mini sprints so

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,850
instead of a normal sprint that can be

00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:35,260
usually two weeks you can have a mini

00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,569
sprint there's like two or three days

00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:40,990
where a group of people that don't

00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:44,230
normally work on the system are trying

00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:46,690
to fix a bunch of issues or working on a

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,949
specific theme so you can say in these

00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:50,470
two or three days we're all going to

00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:51,839
work on typographic issues or we're all

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,749
going to try and fix any

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,329
any buds related performance and this is

00:11:54,749 --> 00:11:59,699
a really nice way to get people that are

00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:01,560
not familiar with the system to know

00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:04,139
where the where things are in the

00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,509
codebase how how do you write the

00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:08,399
documentation just be able to find

00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:11,910
things and make it a little bit less

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:15,120
scary to contribute and obviously you

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:17,730
should write about your work either

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,240
internally like on something just as

00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:24,629
simple as a mailing list but preferably

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:27,089
externally like on a blog if you're not

00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:30,660
the kind of person that is comfortable

00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:32,339
sharing working progress you might have

00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,699
to get out of your comfort zone a little

00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:38,519
bit it's very likely that even people

00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:40,769
they aren't working directly with you on

00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:44,879
the project are going to be affected by

00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:47,519
it and you want this to have a positive

00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,319
impact on their work you don't want the

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,910
design system that you're working on to

00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:52,860
just be another annoyance

00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,629
that they have to work around and that

00:12:52,860 --> 00:13:04,319
they have to deal with on their day to

00:12:54,629 --> 00:13:08,730
day tip number four define your

00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:11,519
contribution process for me a design

00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:13,939
system is never finished Styles can

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,230
change new components are added

00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:18,629
improvements have to be made to the

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,759
codebase and even if you're not

00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:22,319
accepting even if you're not accepting

00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:25,740
contributions from a wider community

00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:27,720
like some open source projects do you

00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,180
might still want to think about defining

00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:34,220
the contribution process even for people

00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:37,559
with a new team so at canonical we did a

00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:40,379
diagram that defines the thought process

00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:43,019
that should happen inside your head

00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:46,050
before you submit a proposal for a new

00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:48,389
component and to get to this point a

00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:51,420
small group of people again got together

00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:54,959
and we sketched a flow diagram on a

00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:58,170
whiteboard everyone gave their opinions

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,550
we erase things put things back and

00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,399
whenever we won

00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,680
we were done we presented this diagram

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,810
to a slightly larger group of people

00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:10,380
that were very invested in the system as

00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:12,660
well to get feedback and we got lots and

00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,190
lots and lots of feedback from them we

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,209
had to revise lots of things that didn't

00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:22,100
make sense and we added other things and

00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:25,620
then we shared it with everyone else and

00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:28,800
by doing this it doesn't mean that now

00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:31,410
this process is set in stone actually it

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,269
has changed quite a few times just like

00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:35,760
the design system itself just like the

00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:37,620
components themselves all of these

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,380
artifacts that you're creating around it

00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:44,310
like the contribution process diagram

00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:47,670
and the roadmap before all of these will

00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:50,190
evolve so the team that is working on

00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,810
the joint project is is quite small but

00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:53,670
even in this case we feel that it's

00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:55,950
necessary to have some guidelines on how

00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:58,019
the design system can be expanded from

00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,850
the initial set of components you

00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,950
shouldn't just go into the code and add

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,800
some new components without having some

00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:06,510
buy-in from the rest of the team we want

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,370
to make sure that new component any

00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:10,170
component that is added or any new

00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:13,500
guideline that is added makes sense not

00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:15,690
to just a very small set of people and

00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,029
also that it follows some rules to

00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:21,390
maintain the consistency and the high

00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:23,579
quality across the system and going

00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:26,579
through this process of thinking how you

00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:29,190
want the system to expand usually also

00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:31,529
brings up important conversations about

00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,180
the systems principles and the values

00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:35,850
and the standards that you want to

00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:38,250
maintain which is key in keeping the

00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:44,730
consistency that you probably want from

00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:47,820
your system tip number five looking

00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:49,260
after your documentation again even if

00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,600
only a small number of people are

00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,940
working with your design system you want

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,550
to define some parameters on how things

00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,680
should be used and how to put everything

00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:01,949
together in two screens or in two pages

00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:04,260
and how people can propose new code or

00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:06,360
make any changes and documentation can

00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,089
be brand guidelines or style guides it

00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,889
can be browser support guidelines

00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:12,649
accessibility guidelines contribution

00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:16,430
guidelines getting started documentation

00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:19,970
coding standards tone-of-voice in a way

00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:23,499
all of these documents are your design

00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:26,870
system if you think that maintaining

00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:29,269
components is hard I think that

00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:33,410
maintaining good documentation is much

00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:35,360
harder but it's also crucial to maintain

00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,430
the consistency and the high standards

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,110
that I'm sure that you want from your

00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:42,709
design system and for all of the

00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:45,379
websites that your teams are gonna you

00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:48,319
build when they use it when they use it

00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:51,230
I don't really have any amazing insights

00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:54,290
on how on how to force people to write

00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:56,120
great documentation every time that they

00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,759
add something to the system because I

00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:02,829
find this point particularly hard so if

00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:04,819
you do I would be happy to - to know

00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:07,069
something that you might want to try

00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:09,470
maybe is to have a column in your task

00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:11,659
board for documentation so that every

00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,059
issue that is being worked on needs to

00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:17,049
go through that step to make it really

00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:19,880
visible you could also consider adding

00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:22,610
documentation to the review process so

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:25,279
that no pull requests can go through if

00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:29,510
there isn't well-written sensible

00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:32,149
documentation around it also test your

00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:34,220
documentation so usually the people that

00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:36,770
write the dogs are very close to the

00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,230
project and they know which components

00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:41,210
are in the library by heart they know

00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:43,010
how everything fits together they know

00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,649
exactly what they should do and what

00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:48,380
they shouldn't do so it's important that

00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:52,490
you let people who are not as familiar

00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:54,649
with the dogs have the dogs guide them

00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:56,600
through the design system and see where

00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:59,240
it lacks detail and where things could

00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,520
be explained better maybe you can do

00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:05,200
this as part of migrating existing sites

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:10,059
- using the the new system so instead of

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:13,610
the design systems team if you have one

00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:15,320
do it do the migrations you can get

00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:18,380
people or you can get a mix of people

00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:21,230
from the product team and the design

00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:24,110
systems team to do it together

00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:25,730
and it's really invaluable feedback on

00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,320
the documentation to go through that

00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:31,039
process with someone that is not as

00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,919
familiar whatever you do remember that

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,440
your dogs need to be clear and they need

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,070
to be specific enough but you don't want

00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:42,019
them necessarily to be authoritarian or

00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:44,419
dogmatic or then you end up scaring

00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:50,899
people out of contributing and out of

00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:54,980
improving the system I wonder when my

00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:58,970
app is and I tell me to stop again it's

00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:01,639
probably soon tip number six make things

00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:05,600
easy to find so all of these things that

00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:07,190
I mentioned so far can very easily very

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,860
quickly be spread around the internet

00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:12,860
without a proper central location and

00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:15,049
you if you expect people to follow all

00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:18,320
of these rules then all of them should

00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:20,389
be very easy to find at the moment when

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,730
people are working with the project or

00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:24,559
on the project and ideally everything

00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:27,740
should be in one location some kind of

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:30,440
central hub this can be as simple as

00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:34,120
having maybe it's an internal wiki or

00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:37,010
it's a dedicated website or it's the

00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:41,809
github pages site or maybe it's just

00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:43,940
your github repo readme file there's

00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:46,880
also several tools that that let you

00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:49,100
create documentation fairly easily as

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,350
long as everything is within reach from

00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,389
one location and it's very visible and

00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:55,639
clear so that you don't have anyone

00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:57,350
asking you where is the browser support

00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:59,990
documentation over and over again or

00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:02,149
where is the texting checklist or oh I

00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,340
did not do any accessibility assessment

00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:06,139
of this new pattern because I didn't

00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,179
even know that there were any guidelines

00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:11,380
so you don't want this to happen so make

00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:17,019
sure that everything is in one place and

00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:20,090
my last tip is plan for maintenance

00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:22,750
again a good design system is never

00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:25,580
really done you don't get to just say

00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:28,630
great that project is now finished it's

00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:32,170
released let's move on to the next thing

00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:34,630
new components are added new guidelines

00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:36,790
are added new technologies are gonna

00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:39,310
have an impact on it maybe you want to

00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,810
add things like animation or you want to

00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:43,420
improve the performance or the

00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:45,460
accessibility or you want to improve the

00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:48,610
microcopy across all of your components

00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:50,530
or maybe you need to start deprecating

00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:54,790
things that aren't useful anymore it

00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:57,010
just never ends and knowing about these

00:20:54,790 --> 00:21:00,070
things that need to happen this just

00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:02,740
doesn't happen by magic for example to

00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:06,310
know about new components that are

00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:08,680
needed or to know that another team

00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:11,890
might be defining a new component that

00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:13,960
will be useful for to your system you

00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:16,540
need to talk to people you need to have

00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:19,900
conversations and these conversations

00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:21,790
don't just happen I think the easiest

00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,860
way to make sure that they do happen is

00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,780
again to book some time in people's

00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:29,200
calendar so I'm afraid that my mean a

00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:30,970
few more meetings a canonical we had

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,000
what we called a working group meeting

00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:36,420
to discuss new component proposals to

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,460
answer any questions any concerns and

00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:42,430
discuss ideas about things that could be

00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:44,710
improved and the process not just about

00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:47,380
the components in specific and this

00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:50,890
working group meeting happened every

00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:52,600
other week the entire design team were

00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:55,510
including front-end and back-end

00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:58,390
developers everyone was invited to these

00:21:55,510 --> 00:22:00,900
meetings is optional guests obviously

00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:03,880
the core framework team had to be there

00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,890
the conversations could go from I think

00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,890
we need some more utility classes to

00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:10,780
deal with spacing or when you are the

00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:13,420
fieldset in a row that has a dark

00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:16,600
background the text color doesn't work

00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:18,720
how can we fix that or maybe someone

00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,550
would say we are we created this new

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,380
accordion pattern for this other product

00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:27,370
and we think it would it would be useful

00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:29,560
for the library how you revise these

00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,780
proposals and evaluate them it's

00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:36,940
something if something needs to be added

00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:38,230
or an easily changed is is up to you but

00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,900
having this

00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:44,050
time in everyone's calendar that is not

00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:46,360
canceled at the last minute even if some

00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:48,820
people can't attend this was really

00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,620
important to us and it worked extremely

00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:53,220
well and everyone was always very

00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:56,530
excited about these meetings

00:22:53,220 --> 00:23:00,300
something else that we also did was we

00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:04,330
worked in regular two-week sprints where

00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:06,910
we worked with with epics a normal epic

00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:10,060
could be something like implement the

00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:12,640
new vertical spacing but also in every

00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:15,910
sprint we had an epic that was just

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,400
called scheduled maintenance works and I

00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:23,740
got that name from Transport for London

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:26,170
of course inside this epic we we could

00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,970
include just any random github issue

00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:30,550
that we wanted to complete in that

00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:32,560
two-week period so it was like small

00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:36,250
things that didn't really merit their

00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:37,960
own epic they weren't associated they

00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,910
weren't associated to any theme that we

00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,620
were working on at that time and this

00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:43,540
also worked really well and it gave us

00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:47,410
some flexibility to just keep fixing

00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:49,420
smaller things so remember that even

00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:52,890
teams at large companies that you might

00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:56,140
think always do everything right and

00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:58,810
they change their minds and they change

00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:00,160
the way that they do things made the way

00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:02,620
through their projects because they

00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,500
learn new things so you should always

00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:10,600
expect change whether it's big or

00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:12,520
whether it's small so to recap make sure

00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:15,670
that you put someone in charge have a

00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:19,000
roadmap be open define your contribution

00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:21,430
process look very carefully after your

00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,200
documentation make things very easy to

00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:30,450
find and plan for maintenance design

00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:35,080
systems as you can see are a lot of work

00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:36,460
but they're also a lot of fun I hope

00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,650
that you can try at least a couple of

00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:40,720
these ideas on in your own projects I

00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:45,650
would love to talk to you about this

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:50,300
more if you want to I'm usually in the

00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:52,840
Design Systems slack channel I don't

00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:57,170
think it's called channel this workspace

00:24:52,840 --> 00:25:01,850
well anyway I'm on it a lot of other

00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:03,890
really cool design systems people like

00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,870
Gina and Nathan Curtis they're always on

00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:08,600
it answering lots of questions it's

00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:11,360
really cool so I'm there if you want to

00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,950
catch me and I'm also on Twitter also if

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,860
you're looking for a new job we're

00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,400
hiring designers and developers so there

00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,490
you go

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,250
and those are all the links and github

00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:24,080
for my for everything that I mentioned

00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:26,960
including all the credits for the

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:31,839
filters as well and that's me

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,839
