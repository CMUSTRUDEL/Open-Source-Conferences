	00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:06,620
so this talk will be a little bit

00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,260
different than probably most of the ones

00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,519
today I will be discussing technology

00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,010
but more broadly and I will be

00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:14,809
discussing the technology industry how

00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:18,710
it intersects with the world that we

00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:23,750
live in in 2017 and it's also a personal

00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:26,570
story of my life in my ear and how I

00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,939
used my position as a technologist to

00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,230
try to make change in the world and some

00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:34,550
of the fallout that has happened from

00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:37,160
that some of the topics in this talk are

00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:40,640
going to be very heavy there's going to

00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,280
be imagery video and discussions that

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,420
are going to be unpleasant to see and I

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,629
don't blame you if you want to leave

00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,760
during it because to be frank if I could

00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:51,980
have left the last two and a half months

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,050
of my life I would have but I have to

00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:57,370
tell this story and part of telling the

00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:00,590
story means showing the real violent

00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:03,050
images of what we have gone through and

00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:08,509
how that relates to our industry in

00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:10,340
general so before I was a data scientist

00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:12,049
I was actually an engineer I worked in

00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,950
medical devices I worked in aerospace

00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:18,020
and one of the things that we do in

00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,359
those industries is we have to deal with

00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,509
quite a bit of regulation in how we

00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:26,029
write software and how we design

00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:29,389
machines components programs operating

00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:31,069
systems algorithms and one case that

00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:33,919
always struck me as very interesting is

00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:35,869
the case of the-- rack 25 the wreck 25

00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:39,079
was an electron beam radiation machine

00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:40,669
built in the 1970s it was programmed

00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:44,419
with pdp-11

00:01:40,669 --> 00:01:47,389
assembly code and over the course of a

00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:49,429
couple of I'd say a decade decade and a

00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:52,340
half there were a number of incidents

00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:55,399
where patients received a dose of

00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:58,579
radiation that was orders of magnitude

00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:01,670
stronger than what they were prescribed

00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:04,189
six patients were overall were affected

00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:08,629
by this and four of them died from their

00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:11,870
injuries when looking into the issue it

00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:14,480
was found that a software bug caused

00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:17,959
this problem this is one of the first

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:22,120
cases of a software bug killing people

00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:26,810
in the in just sort of real-world

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,670
real-life scenarios and in the wake of

00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,019
the investigations and this took many

00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,090
years to figure out what happened

00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:34,970
because it wasn't a very easy software

00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,769
bug to find in order to make it happen

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,590
you had to press a certain key sequence

00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:42,890
with this very specific timing at a very

00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:45,500
specific stage of the process so it was

00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:49,130
very difficult to replicate it was very

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,829
nearly a non-deterministic bug and when

00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:53,930
they found out what happened software

00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:56,540
regulations for medical devices were

00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:59,209
created and I found this fascinating and

00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,549
in my career doing medical device

00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:03,230
development which I no longer do I got

00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:05,239
very involved in the process of how to

00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,650
use certify medical devices how do you

00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:09,410
deal with different classes of medical

00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,780
devices and so when the election

00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:13,609
happened in the United States last year

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,950
I was very interested in the voting

00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:19,730
machines that I used to vote for

00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:22,549
president for other representatives and

00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,620
in my government and I decided a few

00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:27,019
weeks after the election right when we

00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:31,519
were in the height of the recount drama

00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:34,220
and wondering how what just happened

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,230
actually happened I decided to look and

00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,209
see what are the regulatory processes

00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,609
for voting machines are there any and

00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:42,739
what I found was actually quite

00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:44,810
terrifying and this is what kind of

00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:48,230
kicked off my path to being a

00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:49,700
technological activist and it started

00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,489
with a tweet and no good things ever

00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,620
start with a tweet but I'm going to read

00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:55,700
part of one of the test reports for one

00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,720
of these voting machines I'm not going

00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,329
to read the whole thing just the

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,970
important parts as the source code is

00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:04,489
reviewed a sha-256 hash value will be

00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,720
created for each source code file the

00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:08,120
source code team will then conduct

00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,200
automated source code review using czech

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,130
style

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,830
that's it they've partially

00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:18,709
reimplemented get and then they run a

00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,780
linter and that's it so there is no

00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,700
review of the security there is no

00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,940
review of the vote handling pathways

00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:28,220
there's no review that your actual vote

00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,260
gets recorded that it gets recorded

00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,419
properly and they don't actually test

00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,610
for this when they test these machines

00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:37,040
most of the testing that is done is

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,350
Hardware related is it shock protected

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,030
does it work in high humidity what if

00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,919
the paper is creased what if there's a

00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,200
paper jam that kind of thing and that's

00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:46,580
all very important but they only run

00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,700
about a hundred ballots through each

00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:52,700
machine so you could very easily if you

00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,729
were a developer sneaked in some code

00:04:52,700 --> 00:05:00,560
that said after a thousand votes change

00:04:55,729 --> 00:05:02,180
every third vote to candidate X and this

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,880
would not get caught what's even more

00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,290
concerning is when you look at what the

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,600
process by which they go through the

00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:11,750
review they only review source code

00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:15,020
comments and because they're actually

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,850
had failures at line length in the

00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,979
linting process not during the

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,260
development cycle but during the very

00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:22,820
expensive review procedure it tells me

00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,970
that these companies are not using

00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:28,520
proper version control techniques

00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:30,470
because a linter a line length check

00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,630
would be you know you could implement

00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:35,539
that was naively with three lines of

00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,130
Python and trivially implement that into

00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:39,440
a Jenkins build or something like that

00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:41,330
they're not doing that which means if

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,400
they're not doing that it is super easy

00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:47,630
for any skilled developer to put in

00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,160
malicious code so just to give you an

00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,990
example of the kind of code that these

00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,020
voting machines are on this is one

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,700
voting machine one one model this is

00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,470
these are the languages that it uses and

00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,479
C and C++ that makes sense like there's

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,890
embedded stuff and C++ has been around

00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:04,610
for a while everything right has some

00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:07,120
C++ so that's fine and then there's Java

00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,120
and c-sharp

00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:16,090
don't really know why you need both of

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:17,560
those and then there's COBOL and VB and

00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,960
then we're gonna throw some sequel in

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,180
there for good measure really hoping

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,169
that there's a COBOL - sequel or COBOL

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:28,330
the Postgres adapter so when going

00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:31,960
through this I had this realization that

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:34,480
as a technologist I had not just the

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,880
ability to but a duty to preserve

00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,130
democracy because our world isn't

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,950
becoming increasingly increasingly

00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:45,130
technical and if we don't have skilled

00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:46,830
people holding our devices and their

00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,810
manufacturers and their users

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:53,050
accountable for what they are doing then

00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:55,840
we are failing as a society but there's

00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,669
a problem and the problem is that I did

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,860
this in November of 2016 after the u.s.

00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:01,510
presidential election and earlier in

00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,130
that year there was a little bit of a

00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,630
brouhaha that you might have heard of in

00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,510
the in the United States and the tech

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:09,960
industry where a known white supremacist

00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,760
was invited to speak at a conference and

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,830
people tried to shut this down that the

00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,840
conference was lambda comm and it became

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,669
quite controversial and a petition went

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,660
around and I was one of the many

00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:25,479
signatories of that petition punitive ly

00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:28,260
because the tech industry has quite a

00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:31,570
few white supremacists inside of it a

00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,919
site was created to generate a list of

00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,900
all the people who dared speak out

00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:38,229
against this and this was very

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:43,030
explicitly created as an industry hit

00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:44,410
list a list to target individuals to

00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,530
prevent them from getting gaining

00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:50,620
employment to specifically call them out

00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:53,440
to docs them and to harass them and I

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,880
was one of the people on this list and I

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,169
was a little bit proud of this like when

00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,370
you actually get on a list like this

00:07:56,169 --> 00:07:58,820
you're like alright I'm doing the right

00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:01,040
thing

00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:04,700
but the problem is that in looking at

00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:09,350
this list it was compiled with the

00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:10,580
guidance of meelo you nablus and Milo or

00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,080
meelo I'm not really sure how to

00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,600
pronounce his name and I don't really

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,540
care that much worked for Steve been and

00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:20,810
who at the time was the president or CEO

00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:24,200
of Breitbart a media organization in the

00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:27,920
United States that is known for peddling

00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:31,640
a lot of hate stories and conspiracy

00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,830
theories and he was also named as the

00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:37,070
chief strategist of the President of the

00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:39,740
United States so here I am having this

00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,780
realization that I'm on a hit list that

00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,220
is two handshakes away from the desk of

00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,250
the President of the United States and

00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:48,380
now I'm openly questioning whether the

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,320
election was legitimate and it's making

00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:54,320
international news so what do you do

00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,470
when you've got that situation so my

00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,140
answer is I fled the country I went to

00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:03,310
Prague Prague is a lovely City and I

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:08,620
lived there for as long as I could and

00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:13,100
was there watching as my country

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:16,040
implemented horrific policies ban on

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:19,150
Muslims from entering the country there

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,650
was talk of anti-lgbt discrimination

00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:24,200
that what may have led to my passport

00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,860
being revoked this was a terrifying

00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,020
thing to watch

00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,600
I watched friends of mine get arrested

00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,640
in Washington DC they now face 70 years

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,890
in prison because they had the temerity

00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:39,920
beat to be on the same street block as

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:42,230
some people who broke five windows well

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,720
I was in Prague I decided that I needed

00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:47,240
to do more with my activism and I

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,210
decided to route myself in the history

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:53,360
of the place and I spent a lot of time

00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:57,190
at the Yan pelota memorial Yong block

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,940
was a student who in 1969 in January

00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,790
self-immolated at the steps of the

00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:04,070
national museum in Prague to protest the

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,130
Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia at

00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:08,140
the time

00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:10,690
this was a very dramatic moment and what

00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:13,480
struck me because I had to think about

00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,730
what it would be like to be in a system

00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,089
so oppressive to be in a situation so

00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:22,330
dire that the way to use your voice

00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:25,990
would be to literally kill yourself to

00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:28,270
stop existing and so that routed my

00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:32,410
activism because I never wanted to get

00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:34,959
to that point so the question was how do

00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:38,260
I focus my activism to make real change

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,540
how do I use my privilege as a

00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:42,370
technologist to make change in the world

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,980
I was able to do something when I talked

00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,540
about the voting machines and it made

00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,130
waves but it ultimately didn't do

00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,950
anything because nobody has gone and

00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:53,320
fixed it yet we still don't have paper

00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:56,050
ballots we still don't have random audit

00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,180
procedures we still have private

00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:00,550
companies writing closed-source voting

00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:03,040
machine software how do we fix that

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:06,430
well I didn't have the energy to create

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,350
a movement to change that but what I did

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,779
have is a blue checkmark in a Twitter

00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:13,839
profile and so I would speak out against

00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:17,200
industry sexism and racism and try to

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,540
stay in my lane and when I when the

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,790
James d'amore memo came out I might have

00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,320
crossed a little bit of a boundary but

00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:26,080
it actually made a difference because

00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,320
here was somebody saying that they have

00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:31,300
had enough of the sexism and bigotry in

00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:35,260
the industry that they would be willing

00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:40,000
to go to jail to try to stop it from

00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:42,310
happening and of course when I wrote

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,279
this I managed to get my very own

00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:49,420
Breitbart headline Steve Bannon has a

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,820
recurring theme in this story and so

00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:55,959
this wasn't you know exactly the best

00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:58,690
timing but what it really led me to to

00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:01,990
draw my attention to was what does

00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:04,390
activism look like when it is focused

00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:06,760
and effective where can an ordinary

00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:10,149
person like me best make a difference

00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,579
and so the answer to that is to act

00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:14,589
locally there are always problems in our

00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:16,029
communities that need more voices need

00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:18,550
more support need more money

00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:22,270
need more creativity

00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:24,700
or just need somebody to show up and so

00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:27,790
I said all right well once I get back

00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,410
from Prague I'm going to get more

00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:32,830
involved in local activism this whole

00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:34,930
like kicking the Oval Office and

00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:37,240
annoying it and then fleeing the country

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,730
thing is really not my not my strong

00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,280
suit let's stay a little bit more

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,380
low-key I live in Charlottesville

00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,620
Virginia what's the worst that can

00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,620
happen

00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:55,060
and it was great for for a minute we had

00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:58,320
a couple of rallies to talk about some

00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:03,160
things and you know we have some some

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,600
issues in in in that city that are a

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,190
little bit more mundane than what's been

00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,740
on the news and I really wanted to route

00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:12,160
route myself in those and make a

00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:16,480
difference there but Charlottesville had

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,800
other plans because somebody who lives

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,630
in Charlottesville by the name of Jason

00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,560
Kessler decided that it was going to be

00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:25,930
the perfect place to hold a rally to

00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,050
unite the right it was called unite the

00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,820
right and he somehow managed to bring

00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,500
all of these big names together and

00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,050
what's interesting about all of these

00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,260
people is these are not people these are

00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:39,700
not speakers in the traditional mold of

00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:42,040
political thought these are people who

00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:44,950
have built their presence online using

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:47,770
the same systems the same techniques the

00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:51,010
same platforms that we have seen in the

00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:54,370
industry for quite some time Richard

00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:56,710
Spencer 65,000 Twitter followers Baked

00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:59,110
Alaska 170 thousand Twitter followers a

00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:01,540
million YouTube subscribers these are

00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:05,020
people whose entire movement has been

00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:08,320
built on the very platforms that we

00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:11,530
create that we optimize that we plan

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,840
around that we implement as features so

00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:18,890
as technologists we are complicit in

00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:20,970
this how do we make that not happen

00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:23,940
so this was really interesting to me

00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:25,890
because here it was and if you look at

00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:30,600
this poster and it may be hard to see

00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:33,240
but these are memes that are up there

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,330
the the Pepe Miam that is common among

00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:40,130
bright weighing trolls online that's how

00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:42,630
this was being advertised this was an

00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:44,370
evolution of what we had been witnessing

00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:46,890
for the past five years with gamergate

00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:49,140
and now it was going to come and it was

00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:52,380
going to finally manifest itself in

00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:57,450
physical space and it was going to do it

00:14:52,380 --> 00:15:01,770
half a mile from where I live and it

00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:03,330
manifested and this was the night of

00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:10,290
August 11th at the University of

00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:13,740
Virginia 300 to 350 people carrying

00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:16,560
torches marched through the University

00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:21,390
of Virginia grounds they chanted Nazi

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:24,510
slogans they chanted Jews will not

00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:26,070
replace us and when they get to their

00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:28,770
destination the Statue of Thomas

00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:32,730
Jefferson out front of UVA is famous

00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:35,970
Rotonda they found a small group of

00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:39,540
counter-protesters students 19 20 years

00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:43,250
old and some community members maybe

00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:47,010
about 30 people tops I was one of them

00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:48,870
and what they did was they marched down

00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:51,400
the steps and they immediately

00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:55,720
surrounded us

00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:58,120
with torches with weapons and as they

00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,930
surrounded us they get closer and closer

00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:04,680
and closer I'm going to play what it

00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,680
sounded like

00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:44,640
as they encroached upon us they yelled

00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:47,670
things like die commie they were

00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:51,240
chanting white lives matter in response

00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:54,120
to our black lives matter chant and then

00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,040
they maced us and they poured fuel on us

00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,200
and then they started swinging lit

00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,720
torches at us and when they fail to

00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:07,770
light us on fire they decided to beat us

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:10,589
with those torches the next day was the

00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:13,290
rally proper this is an image from that

00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:15,000
day these men are not soldiers and if

00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:18,030
you're not from the United States maybe

00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,100
you don't have a really strong grasp of

00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:23,360
what gun culture is like in the United

00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:26,640
States these are private citizens

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:30,780
they're not police they're not National

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:34,560
Guard these are people who just live in

00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:40,980
the area and decided to come load it to

00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:46,230
bed with assault rifles handguns who

00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:51,540
knows what and in the resistance to this

00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:56,730
rally we had to deal with six different

00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:58,059
militias seven different armed police

00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:02,229
forces

00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:05,259
and that doesn't even count the Nazis

00:18:02,229 --> 00:18:10,899
that were carrying shields and clubs and

00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:12,639
flag poles what was interesting about

00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:16,330
this rally was that it was organized

00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:20,369
entirely online and so if you have spent

00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:25,090
time online you know that patrolling is

00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:27,009
egregious sometimes ridiculous and it's

00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:29,649
out there and it's easy to dismiss it's

00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:31,450
easy to think this isn't real nobody

00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:33,940
actually thinks that nobody it would

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,919
actually do that and so when they joked

00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,859
about running down protesters with a car

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,539
we compiled a document and we brought it

00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:42,460
to our city and to our police and we

00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:44,019
said this is what they're going to do

00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:49,119
they're going to come here and do this

00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:52,239
and the city waited and they said well

00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,710
there's nothing we can do and then

00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:57,779
finally they took it to a court and the

00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,779
judge said these threats aren't real and

00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:02,820
then that happens

00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:11,570
a Nazi drove his car down a road 50

00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:16,279
miles an hour into a group of peaceful

00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:18,559
protesters who were celebrating that the

00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:20,480
rally had ended who were causing no

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:26,450
violence and who were walking on a

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:28,249
street that was supposed to be closed 30

00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:33,799
people were hurt including many of my

00:19:28,249 --> 00:19:36,399
friends and one person died that online

00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:40,489
rhetoric became real

00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:44,090
everything about online trolling became

00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:45,109
real and I was right there and that's me

00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:51,379
and that striped shirt in the blue

00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:54,830
backpack and I talked about gun culture

00:19:51,379 --> 00:19:58,009
in the United States and the six

00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:59,679
militias that we had my arm is like this

00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:01,909
because I had to be carrying a gun

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,950
because all of the threats that were

00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:05,720
being made against our community we're

00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:10,070
also being made against me personally

00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:12,769
and for the weeks leading up to unite

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:15,049
the right and specifically in response

00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:17,899
to my comments about James d'amour

00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:22,489
I spent the week before receiving dozens

00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:27,739
of direct death threats a day that was

00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:30,710
15 feet away when he attacked us and had

00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:33,859
he come out of that car with a gun I was

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:37,789
the only person on site that could have

00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:42,919
stopped him that's how real this has

00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:46,249
gotten but what's interesting is this

00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:48,129
isn't just abstract in the link between

00:20:46,249 --> 00:20:52,070
these things

00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:54,350
there's actually a direct link and if

00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:56,509
you haven't read the BuzzFeed story that

00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:59,720
came out two weeks ago three weeks ago

00:20:56,509 --> 00:21:02,659
whatever it was that talks about the

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:05,989
links between gamergate and journalists

00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:08,899
and people in politics you should read

00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:11,960
it because there is a direct link

00:21:08,899 --> 00:21:14,330
between gamergate between lambda cops

00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,240
and between unite the right

00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:20,450
all of these people are related this was

00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:24,140
all part of one movement this was all

00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:25,909
part of one design my low yen appleís is

00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,769
connected with Steve Bannon and Kurtis

00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:29,690
Arvind who's connected to Richard

00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:32,450
Spencer who is connected to Jason

00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:34,159
Kessler and so what happened in

00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,019
Charlottesville might have been news to

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:41,539
you but I have been living this for

00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:47,120
three years this is very very real and

00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:50,090
as technologists this is our space we

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:54,429
have the ability to control this we have

00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:54,429
the power to stop this from happening

00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,389
there is a little bit of good news that

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,159
came out of this because for all of the

00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:03,769
grief that Steve Bannon has caused me

00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:05,570
personally over the past few years it

00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:09,649
was Charlottesville that took him out of

00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:14,360
power it was what we did that led to him

00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:18,380
leaving and it's a hollow victory

00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:20,720
because so many people are hurt three

00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,580
people are dead when you count the two

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,260
State Police troopers who died when

00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,260
their helicopter crashed on August 12

00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:34,240
but that's what it took and every time I

00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:37,190
think about this I just think about this

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,860
that is technologists we have a duty not

00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:43,610
just to preserve democracy but actually

00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:45,669
to fight white supremacy because we

00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:49,309
built the tools that make this possible

00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:52,760
we work for the companies that give

00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:56,019
these people platforms we designed the

00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:59,960
integrations that make it easy for them

00:22:56,019 --> 00:23:03,350
we are the data scientists who can

00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:06,460
design the algorithms we are the UX

00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:09,470
designers that can build better tools

00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:15,850
for blocking and reporting and ending

00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:15,850
harassment it needs to be our priority

00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:25,710
and as was introduced I guess along

00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:28,410
those lines I will say that in a minor

00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:30,800
victory for this I had to fly in late

00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:33,660
yesterday because I had to be in court

00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:36,270
because the organizer of unite the right

00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:38,520
Jason Kessler I managed to actually get

00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:39,400
him arrested for online harassment which

00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:48,919
is such a rare

00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:53,009
[Applause]

00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:56,249
which is such a rare victory in this

00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:58,739
world because we don't have the tools

00:23:56,249 --> 00:24:01,379
because it's so easy to hide it is so

00:23:58,739 --> 00:24:03,149
easy to be anonymous it is so easy to

00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:07,769
just bury ourselves in a discord server

00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:10,649
or to use an alt twitter account and to

00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:11,369
get away with it and so he made a

00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:14,849
mistake

00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:18,599
and now he's facing jail time possibly

00:24:14,849 --> 00:24:21,210
for it but what else can we do what else

00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:22,440
can we build to make this better

00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,809
for the people who are out there

00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,969
fighting and if you're not out there

00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:29,190
fighting this is my call to action

00:24:26,969 --> 00:24:30,690
whatever it is that you can do whatever

00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,070
it is and I'm not saying that you have

00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:34,080
to be out in the streets because that

00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,489
was horrible but whatever you do

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,289
whatever your privilege is whatever your

00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:41,070
platform is whatever your skills are

00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:44,599
please please please consider using them

00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:48,350
to fight this and if nothing else

00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:52,580
let's fix voting machines thank you

00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:52,580
