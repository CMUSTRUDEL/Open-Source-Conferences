thank you thank you very much much I

00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:15,469
agree this is a quite a lineup that's

00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:18,260
been set for today a very very exciting

00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:20,029
day full of action-packed stuff so I'm

00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,310
supposed to open the show I got to talk

00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:23,539
about exciting stuff as well so okay and

00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,009
that's beer you're gonna learn a lot of

00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:27,140
exciting stuff today let's kick it off

00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:30,800
with some exciting stuff let's talk

00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:36,380
about economics let's talk about

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:39,110
capitalism so there are competing

00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:42,170
theories of economies and how to run an

00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:44,240
economy capitalism being one of them

00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:47,060
and the theory with capitalism is that

00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,760
if you have an open market that

00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:52,060
competition healthy competition kind of

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,710
keeps things in check some

00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:57,980
self-regulating economy through this

00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,180
invisible hand right and the idea is

00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,640
that if you have that if you have this

00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,680
this this healthy marketplace you end up

00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,750
with a distribution of wealth that's

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,490
somewhat like a bell curve bell curve

00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,909
distributions show up a lot right in

00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:14,060
like school tests or you know IQ or

00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:14,960
height or weight aid right it's

00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,820
generally a bell curve distribution

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,859
which means yes some people have more

00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,069
than others some people have less but it

00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:24,140
all more or less kind of evens out so

00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:25,880
the theory with capitalism is you some

00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,950
people will have more wealth than others

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,140
but it's fairly evenly distributed

00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:34,249
because of this this healthy competition

00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:36,829
that the market self-regulates but what

00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:38,450
tends to happen when you leave it to

00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:40,100
self-regulation is you get a

00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:43,340
distribution more like this a power-law

00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,530
distribution where you got like the one

00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:50,979
percent right having a whole lot more

00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:50,979
wealth and then a long tail of poverty

00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:55,159
so bell curve distribution would be

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,139
great what we end up with a power-law

00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:59,299
distribution like I said it's because

00:01:57,139 --> 00:02:00,619
what what we what gets lost is the

00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:03,319
healthy competition the healthy

00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:08,270
marketplace the kind of self-regulating

00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:10,580
part so so capitalism sounds great in

00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,970
theory but doesn't really work in

00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,410
practice

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,000
and personally actually leave the

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:19,230
theories the theory is pretty good

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,690
because competition I think is good I

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,540
think a healthy marketplace of

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,580
competition is good and the alternative

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,080
where you get monopolies do you opera Li

00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,420
right where you get power concentrated

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,420
in a small number of players we get

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:36,000
companies that are too big to fail is

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,640
not good right that that this kind of

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,590
distribution of power doesn't work out

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,140
that well and I say that because we've

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:47,250
all been here we've seen this play out

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:50,850
in our own industry when the browser

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,190
Wars happened when when Internet

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:56,760
Explorer ended up with absolute monopoly

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:59,130
of browser sharing over 90% very much in

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,470
that you know power law distribution

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:05,040
shooting off right and that happened

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:07,980
because they had an existing monopoly in

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,390
the desktop operating system world right

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,400
and then they were able to bundle their

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,950
web browser with their operating system

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,020
which itself enjoyed over 90% market

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,760
share so this is the problem when

00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,050
capitalism goes from being this bell

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,970
curve distribution to power law

00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:24,540
distribution is that the people in that

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,520
in that narrow margin they can do oh

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,230
basically whatever they want and there's

00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,810
no accountability there's no no

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:32,580
regulation now we met have to dodged a

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,440
bullet here right we managed to pull it

00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,560
back from the brink I mean Firefox was a

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:42,090
direct result answer to this this

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,860
situation and since then I'm very much

00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,430
at the belief that the more web browsers

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,650
the better

00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,090
I know sometimes web developers like

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,430
think how life would be so much easier

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,470
if we just had like one web browser to

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,700
develop for us like no no we've been

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:59,760
there it was not a good scene right it

00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,709
you know it was comfortable in a way you

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,519
only had one browser to code for right

00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:06,720
ie6 that was it and even Microsoft

00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:08,870
stopped developing browsers they're like

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,430
that's it there's only one web browser

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:13,470
but it was not good for the web and in

00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,790
you know wasn't good for us so be

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,109
careful what you wish for right next

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,340
time you think there's all these

00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:20,130
different browsers I wish there was just

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,530
one browser it's like no no that's

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,750
- be careful what you wish for but we

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,130
dodged a bullet here right we managed to

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,470
manage to pull it back and we have a

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,510
fairly healthy amount of competition in

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,700
the browser market today I wish there

00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,590
were more like I said more browsers -

00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:38,340
better so I kind of feel like the web in

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:41,880
interpreted this monopoly is damaged and

00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,410
and routed around it there was a there

00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,310
was a bit of an invisible hand happening

00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,870
there and this idea of interpreting

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,450
something is damaged and rooting around

00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:53,220
it that's the term that comes from from

00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:56,160
networks right this idea that a network

00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:59,520
can can route around damage and like

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,460
economics there's varying competing

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,990
theories of how to build a network how

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,610
to construct a network just like there's

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,180
competing theories and how to build an

00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,700
economy so one of the models you could

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:16,770
choose if you're building a network is

00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:18,360
this hub-and-spoke model so not all

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,220
nodes on the network are equal right

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,390
you've got these kind of smaller nodes

00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,520
in the outside all connecting to a

00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,380
central hub and then the central hubs

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,910
can connect to one another so this would

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,920
have been how the telegraph system

00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,750
worked and then that was picked up at a

00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,840
phone system right we literally had the

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:36,600
operators doing the switching this is

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,050
still the way that airports work like

00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,070
globally so you've lots of regional

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,080
airports that connect to the central

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,990
hubs and then the central hubs connect

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,920
to one another and it works it works it

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,980
works really well

00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,330
until you lose the central hub right so

00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,610
what you've got is a single point of

00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:56,130
failure and if that central hub gets

00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,600
knocked out those those regional nodes

00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,300
are stranded

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,760
there's no way to communicate so you got

00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:06,570
a single point of failure in form of

00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,400
this monopolistic node on the network of

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:11,400
course that vulnerability was the the

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,080
impetus behind the ARPANET all right

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,670
which is sort of a precursor to the

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,590
internet the city if you got a

00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:18,720
communications network like this which

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:22,230
is exactly what the phone system was

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,390
then you are vulnerable to attack right

00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:27,990
an enemy power just needs to knock out

00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:32,090
your hub and now your nodes are stranded

00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:33,930
right so an alternative approach is to

00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,240
distribute the connection

00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,949
this is a distributed network and this

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,130
is much more like a bell curve

00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:43,979
distribution in that some nodes do have

00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:44,520
more connections than others but not by

00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,320
much

00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,970
some have a few more some of a few less

00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,259
but it evens out

00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:52,050
you know most of nodes are relatively

00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:55,020
even so even if you were to knock out a

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,580
relatively well-connected node the other

00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,979
nodes can still communicate not as

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,110
efficiently as they could before but

00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:02,850
they can still route signals around this

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,460
is the genius of packet switching right

00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:08,099
it's like you just get a signal from one

00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,349
node to another using whatever path you

00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:11,849
want and this this idea of packet

00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:14,039
switching which is at the heart of the

00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:16,349
ARPANET and then led to the internet

00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:19,860
that came out as a direct result of the

00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:22,380
problem of a centralized communication

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,970
network which you probably heard earlier

00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,860
the internet was built to withstand a

00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,930
nuclear attack it's not it's not as

00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,509
simple as that but the initial impetus

00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,610
for this sort of distributed network did

00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:34,590
come from the fear of having a

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:37,440
centralized communication hub it did

00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:39,270
come from command and control I think

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,070
some people you know sometimes used that

00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,539
to say like oh there's there's blood on

00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,590
the hands of the internet because it

00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:46,620
came out of this kind of you know

00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:49,440
warlike idea that it was about having

00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,690
step up on the enemy but actually know

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,000
if you if you go back and read what Paul

00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,919
Baran and the other people at ARPANET

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,240
were talking about it was the exact

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,039
opposite because there's thing if you

00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,930
have a communication network with that

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,270
hub-and-spoke model and you've got that

00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,740
single to the hub and that could be

00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:08,009
taken out in your whole communication

00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:11,340
network goes down then in case of

00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:13,080
possible conflict you're more likely to

00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,220
launch a first strike because you know

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,400
if the enemy gets in there and gets your

00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,080
hub you're screwed if however you've got

00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,970
a distributed network and you know you

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,330
could actually withstand an attack and

00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,919
and then decide what to do in the case

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,630
of that just you know first decision

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,080
you're less likely to launch a first

00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:32,909
strike provided that both sides have

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,020
this distributed network so Paul Baran

00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:36,329
and the other people who came up with

00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,130
this sort of model we're in favor of

00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:39,719
sharing this technology with the

00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,180
Russians even though this was like the

00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,769
height of the Cold War so it wasn't

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,480
built to get an upper hand in

00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:48,910
case of nuclear war it was actually

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,999
built to reduce the possibility of

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:54,429
nuclear war even happening so this

00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:56,889
network architecture this distributed

00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:59,259
architecture was then inherited by the

00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:02,829
internet which was sort of a successor

00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:03,670
to the ARPANET and it's it's kind of

00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:06,779
like the opposite of the hub-and-spoke

00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:10,059
which has the idea of you know central

00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:11,739
powerful nodes is that like anybody can

00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:12,339
join right you can just keep adding to

00:09:11,739 --> 00:09:13,989
the network

00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:16,089
it's scale-free it doesn't matter how

00:09:13,989 --> 00:09:18,249
big or how small the overall network is

00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:19,899
you can just keep adding nodes and all

00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:22,420
the nodes are more or less equal and

00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:24,910
then that same architecture again is

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:27,699
pretty much what we use on the web you

00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,829
don't need to apply to add a new website

00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:32,309
to the web you just make a new website

00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:35,199
right you don't need permission to link

00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:37,569
to another node on the network you just

00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:39,730
link and so again it's the scale-free

00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:41,619
network the the web could be small the

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:45,850
web could be big it doesn't have a

00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:47,829
planned architecture so more every URL

00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,019
as far as the web is concerned this is

00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:51,999
equal course some URL to more popular

00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:56,319
than other URLs but in theory and the

00:09:51,999 --> 00:10:00,309
network layer every URL is equal so it's

00:09:56,319 --> 00:10:03,189
a mess it's a beautiful mess but it's

00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:04,629
wild and sprawling and chaotic

00:10:03,189 --> 00:10:07,299
that's kind of what makes it so great

00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:10,389
this this wild sprawling chaotic world

00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:13,179
wide web but in the early days of the

00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:17,379
web there was competition these kind of

00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:20,679
much more constrained curated places

00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:22,600
safer places as you had CompuServe AOL I

00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:24,910
don't mean AOL the web site now before

00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,100
it was a web site AOL was literally like

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:29,529
an alternative to the web

00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:33,369
you had its own web browser could you

00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:37,959
remember the AOL web browser yeah as old

00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:40,959
people yeah yeah in fact it's kind of

00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:42,939
like I kind of that there's maybe a an

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,230
analogy to be drawn with native apps as

00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:47,230
well like these these things were

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,999
slicker and better you know in many ways

00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,459
but they couldn't compete with that the

00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:54,369
sprawling Masand of the World Wide Web

00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:56,980
right so CompuServe AOL these these sort

00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:58,540
of walled gardens they're producing the

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,160
content for you say no no say

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,810
read these articles here's this

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,510
wonderful stuff we're making for you

00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:06,820
you know beware when you go out into the

00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:10,780
wild lawless world wide web and stay

00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:12,550
within the the gated community of AOL or

00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:15,070
CompuServe but they couldn't compete

00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:17,680
they couldn't compete with the wild

00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:20,710
lawless world wide web and all the the

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,370
wonderful stuff being produced there so

00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:26,100
the web

00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:29,320
absolutely won over these walled gardens

00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,030
and yet fast forward a few years and

00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:35,730
everyone's back inside some walled

00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:37,840
gardens Facebook Twitter medium right

00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,270
and here's the crazy thing that a o L

00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,790
and CompuServe had loads of staff trying

00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:44,230
to produce really you know good content

00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,030
that would keep people within the walled

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,210
gardens so that people wouldn't you know

00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:50,590
go out to the World Wide Web and

00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:54,190
Facebook and Twitter I mean they don't

00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:56,440
even produce the content we do they're

00:11:54,190 --> 00:12:00,370
the biggest media companies in the world

00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:03,760
and they don't produce any media we make

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:06,430
the media for them but then they get to

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:10,150
decide what happens with it who sees it

00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:13,480
they get to control the hyperlinks how

00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:15,160
did this happen how do we go back into

00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,720
the walled gardens that aren't even

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,550
frankly as good as the ones we had

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,550
before because we have to make our own

00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,630
entertainment within them and I remember

00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,100
when I first came across Facebook

00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,050
because you know I was on all these

00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,100
different social networks and all of

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,900
them kind of had something in common

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,420
which was this idea of the social object

00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:34,210
that that the network was built around a

00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:36,010
thing so Flickr was a social network

00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:37,870
based around photographs the photograph

00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:40,540
was a social object it was an upcoming

00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:42,610
org was events right dopler was about

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,140
travel so you had it you had a reason

00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,430
and then the network was built around

00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,510
that and someone's telling about

00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,620
Facebook and saying you should get on

00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:50,500
Facebook and I was like oh yeah okay

00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,060
what's it for right so like you know

00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,460
expecting an answer like in the same way

00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:57,340
Flickr is for photographs or upcoming as

00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:59,110
for events so I said what's it for and

00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:02,790
the person tell me about I said everyone

00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:05,290
is on it no yeah no no but what's it for

00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:07,660
everyone is on it and now I realize

00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,550
that's exactly the reason that is what

00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,089
Facebook is for everyone is on Facebook

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:14,279
because everyone is on Facebook

00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:17,610
right and this is the classic example of

00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:19,769
Metcalfe's law that the the power of a

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,689
network is proportional to the square of

00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:23,370
the number of use something like that

00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:24,920
right that basically the more people on

00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,649
your network it doesn't get just

00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,149
linearly better like the network is

00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:34,529
exponential you get you get a power law

00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:36,420
distribution that with every extra user

00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:38,249
of that network it's like whoever had

00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,709
the first fax machine basically had a

00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:42,089
lump it's useless but as soon as there

00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:45,360
was one more fax machine

00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:46,680
it was exponentially more useful it's

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,920
kind of like that so everyone is on

00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,329
Facebook because everyone is on Facebook

00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,699
which is powerful to absolutely making

00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:57,389
use of Metcalfe's law you get that power

00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:58,800
law distribution that's great but this

00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:00,899
also suffers from the hub-and-spoke

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,220
problem is that you now have a single

00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,279
point of failure

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:09,180
so for example if this is where everyone

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:12,899
is is producing and consuming media if

00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:14,550
you if you want to attack media instead

00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:16,740
of having to take out like hundreds of

00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:19,139
media outlets you can just go for the

00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,660
hub so let's say oh I don't know let's

00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:23,819
say you're Russian propagandists and you

00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,259
want to attack Western democracy you

00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:26,819
don't have to take out hundreds of

00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:30,720
different outlets you just need to

00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:33,389
target the hub's Facebook Twitter jobs a

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,439
good'un right it's it's it's a I guess

00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:36,509
in the security world they talk about

00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:39,209
large attack vectors right this is it's

00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:41,370
a large attack vector it's like you know

00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:42,779
you have a wordpress install you really

00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,999
need to keep it past because there's all

00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:47,040
sorts of attacks made on WordPress it's

00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:49,019
not that WordPress is any any more

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,179
vulnerable than other CMS's it's just

00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:53,670
it's really popular and that makes it a

00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:54,870
large attack vector same with with

00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,879
something like Facebook or Twitter it's

00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:59,069
very popular which gives you all these

00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,959
benefits gives you Metcalfe's law right

00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:03,329
it's exponentially more powerful than a

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,689
smaller network but it's a large attack

00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:08,970
vector which is a shame so you get you

00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:11,850
suffer from the hub-and-spoke model so

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:13,829
but why is everybody on Facebook way on

00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,559
Twitter it's actually not that hard a

00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:18,449
question to answer as convenient the

00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,579
friction is really low if you want to

00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:23,309
publish something on the web it's so

00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:25,120
much more easier to you know shoot

00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:28,300
something off on Facebook or Twitter

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,310
then to you know get your own domain and

00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,870
make your own website and you know

00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:34,720
you've got to deal with keeping that

00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:36,670
that WordPress install patched right and

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,610
all that stuff so you get a whole lot of

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:43,570
convenience by staying within a walled

00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:45,610
garden the downside is you get you you

00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,620
lose the control the control you would

00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:50,260
have if if you were in charge of the

00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,930
hyperlinks you've ceded that control now

00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:55,810
to to the walled garden to Facebook to

00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:57,100
Twitter to whatever it might be so this

00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,490
is the fundamental problem is you've got

00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,750
the hassle and the friction of

00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,970
publishing your own content compared to

00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:06,670
the convenience of letting someone else

00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:09,339
take care of that but what you give up

00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:11,290
is control you cede control to those

00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:15,880
same people they control the hyperlinks

00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:18,190
data side who sees what right so that's

00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,750
where the indie web comes in is to try

00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,240
and bridge this gap it's not that you

00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,890
know we think everybody should be

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,420
installing their own operating systems

00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:28,000
and running their own computers in their

00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:30,160
kitchens you can do that if you want but

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,970
if somehow I have both the convenience

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,260
and the control at the same time which

00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,630
is a challenge that's a real challenge

00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,610
how can we get control publishing our

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,890
own sites control of owning our own data

00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:44,290
without sacrificing the convenience of

00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:46,900
the walled gardens so the basic idea of

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,330
the disc indie web sort of movement is a

00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:52,120
shocker is that you should have a

00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:54,580
website right time was that would not

00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,990
have been an uncontroversial idea but

00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:59,230
these days it's it's it's downright

00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:01,270
disruptive now personally I have another

00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,920
reason why I want to have control and

00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:06,670
published from my own website and that's

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:09,250
the longevity of what I publish been

00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:11,740
around long enough now that trust no one

00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,199
is my manager when it comes to giving

00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,120
someone else content right giving

00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:19,050
someone else your your writings your

00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:21,520
your thoughts your dreams your hopes

00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:25,720
if you ever published and blogged on

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:28,559
MySpace sorry it's gone right and what

00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,150
myspace was the Facebook of its days a

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,190
possible to imagine a web without

00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,680
myspace just as it's impossible to

00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,500
imagine

00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,900
a web without facebook but anything you

00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:43,520
published there is gone play with geo

00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:47,780
city's delicious magnolia pounds doppler

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,950
I could go on right been there man now

00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,940
I'm not saying that everything should be

00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,860
online forever

00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,770
far from it what I'm saying is that the

00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:57,260
decision about when something disappears

00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:58,850
should be in the hands of the person who

00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,280
put that thing online it should be your

00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:03,170
decision how long something is online I

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,030
want things to be online for a long time

00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:07,040
that's my decision you might want things

00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:09,620
to be online for a short time it's your

00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:14,210
decision point is you should have that

00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:17,210
decision making control longevity on the

00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:20,270
web is a big problem anyway link rot is

00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:22,040
is as a really big issue with the web

00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:25,280
the average lifespan of a web page is

00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:27,710
100 days it's kind of built into the

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,020
architecture of the web in a way when

00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:32,090
Tim berners-lee and Robo Caillou first

00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,070
had this world wide web project they

00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:36,320
submitted a paper to a hypertext

00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:38,060
conference saying yeah we want to talk

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:42,440
about this worldwide web project we've

00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:44,240
built and the paper was rejected know

00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,670
it's stupid what you're proposing

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,560
because for one thing there was no

00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:51,350
concept of two-way links on the web

00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:54,020
every other theoretical hypertext system

00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:55,850
had this idea of two-way links that you

00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,250
know you're connecting a node over there

00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:03,080
but also that node has knowledge of the

00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:06,470
connection so that then if if the linked

00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,030
resource were to move the the connection

00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,260
could be maintained there was because

00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:12,530
there's that two-way linking which is a

00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:14,450
group you know great in theory not so

00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:17,300
good in practices much like capitalism

00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:18,860
because this is so much more complex to

00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,290
implement which the web has a

00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:23,330
ridiculously simple model which is you

00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:26,780
just link to something it's a one-way

00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:27,830
link that's it you don't need to set

00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,760
anything special up you don't need to

00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,500
ask for permission you just link to

00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,850
something but then if that linked

00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:36,470
resource were to move oh well tough luck

00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:38,810
404 right you got you got bit rock so

00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:40,880
it's kind of the price we pay for the

00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:43,210
simplicity and ease of the web is that

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,350
link rot seems to be built into the web

00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:46,880
but um

00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,429
that's kind of a technique that if you

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:53,140
if you squinted it just right it sort of

00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:57,260
seems like two-way linking on the web

00:19:53,140 --> 00:20:01,100
and it's down to a very humble bit of

00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:03,380
HTML the rel attribute which you're all

00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,450
probably familiar with from you know the

00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,940
link element rel is short for a

00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:10,039
relationship and the attribute says the

00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,100
relationship of the linked document so

00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:14,630
whatever is in the href attribute is

00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,520
whatever the value of rel is so you've

00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,340
probably all done this where you link

00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,870
off to a stylesheet you put the URL in

00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:24,409
the href and you say link rel equals

00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:26,750
stylesheet this the linked document CSS

00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:29,710
file has the relationship of being a

00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:32,630
stylesheet for the current document and

00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:34,909
it doesn't just happen on a link element

00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:37,190
you can use it on a elements as well how

00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:38,900
many people do but just so you know it's

00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,909
a valid attribute so you can say things

00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,980
like oh the link document what's in the

00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:45,110
href is the previous document to this

00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,030
one right it has that relationship or

00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,890
it's the next document so these are very

00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:51,440
useful in like search results pages you

00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,549
can say rel equals Preval equals next so

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,830
there's a whole bunch of these values

00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:55,789
you can you can throw in there and and

00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,760
there's one that on the face of it

00:20:55,789 --> 00:21:01,340
sounds really silly actually rel equals

00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:04,400
me and the linked document has a

00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:07,850
relationship of being me right doesn't

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,990
seem to make sense at first but I use it

00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:12,049
I use in my own website and here's how

00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:15,679
I'd use it I'd link off to another URL

00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:17,000
that also represents me on the web that

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,669
isn't my own website so here I'm looking

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,770
to the Twitter profile that I have

00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:24,470
control over and saying that's me over

00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:27,730
there on Twitter and that's me on Flickr

00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:30,110
that's me on github

00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,880
okay fine but these are still just

00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:34,429
regular one way links I'm just pointing

00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,460
out to something saying here's a here's

00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:40,340
a hyperlink it's got a relatively it's

00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:42,559
so what well the interesting thing is if

00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,390
you go to all those URLs my profile on

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,940
Twitter my profile on Flickr my profile

00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:51,169
on github all of those sites allow you

00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:54,110
to in your info specify your web page

00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:56,570
and so on Twitter if you were to view

00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:58,870
source on the link back to my web page

00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,700
you would see that they also

00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,750
use rel equals me so they're saying that

00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,710
website there doc teo calm my website

00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,750
has a relationship of being another

00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:10,090
representation of this twitter account

00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,100
and so now you've got both of them

00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:14,920
claiming control right saying this these

00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,670
are the same person and they're it's

00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,420
verified now that it's kind of a two-way

00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,640
verification happening there there's a

00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,930
two way claim i claim to have control

00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,250
over their Twitter profile a Twitter

00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:26,860
profile claims the same person was

00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:31,570
control over my site but what can you do

00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:35,500
with that well each of those services

00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:37,900
Twitter github Flickr and many more they

00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,970
all offer authentication part of their

00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:43,030
API layers that you authenticate against

00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:45,910
it using OAuth now I do not want to

00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:49,330
become an OAuth provider I I'm just not

00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:51,309
smart enough to set that up but thanks

00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,650
to the mutual rel equals me links I

00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:56,410
don't have to I can piggyback on the

00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:58,860
fact that Twitter github Flickr they've

00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:01,840
already built that authentication layer

00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:05,320
and I can make use of that using this

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,559
rel me authentication so you can set up

00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,970
a service like this one called India

00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:21,190
where you you literally sign in with

00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:24,970
with your own website there we go so I

00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:27,190
can be putting my web address now I'll

00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,200
get it'll it'll look through my page

00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,190
find those rel me links check that this

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,200
reciprocal ones

00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:34,179
I'll choose which provider today I feel

00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,559
like logging with Twitter now I have to

00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:37,360
make you know I have to be logged in and

00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:40,140
do the authentication dance and I'm back

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,220
I have authenticated as my own website

00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,650
right don't need to have an account I

00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,660
just need to have my own website so I've

00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:49,660
logged in using my own website and all I

00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:52,420
had to do was add an attribute to some

00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:55,330
hyperlinks rel equals me but why would I

00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:56,140
want to authenticate with something what

00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,750
does that give me

00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:03,520
okay so authentication is one part of

00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:05,559
having an API another part is is having

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,270
a something people can write to so

00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:08,679
there's this standard called micro pub

00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:11,040
that's I think it's candidate

00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:13,560
recommendation now to w3c

00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,330
and it's an endpoint that you can have

00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,400
on your website so this is much this is

00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:18,870
more complicated than simply adding rel

00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,580
equals me now you've got to build an

00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:22,050
endpoint on your website but it's a

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,160
server-side thing so you can build it in

00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:26,340
whatever language you're comfortable

00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:30,840
with right node or PHP or whatever you

00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:32,130
want and it accepts post requests you

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,050
don't have to build your authentication

00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:36,150
part though right just have to build its

00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:39,540
endpoint so once you've done that you

00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:47,520
can login to services using your own

00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:49,530
website so yeah I'm doing a sign and

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,530
again doing the authentication and now

00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:55,860
I'm logged into somebody else's posting

00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:57,510
interface right so I can post from

00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:00,990
somebody else's interface into my

00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:02,340
website I did have to build a microp of

00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,320
endpoint but I didn't have to take care

00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,150
of the authentication so now I can I can

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,710
use other people's posting interface as

00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,750
long as they have to micro pub support

00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,950
to post to my own site this was an

00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:14,280
example of one called

00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:16,140
quill was built by Erin perky and it's

00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,610
really nice because you can if you want

00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,200
to do more longer form content he's

00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:21,060
built an interface that's just like

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,170
medium because that's a lot the reason

00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,280
why a lot of people use medium is they

00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:25,320
say oh it's such a lovely writing

00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,170
experience so he's basically built that

00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,400
experience but you can post a microp up

00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:31,710
endpoint and he's built these other

00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,740
services to cold own your graham and own

00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:36,750
your swarm that allow you to use

00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:41,430
Instagram to post to your own website or

00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:44,130
use swarm to post to your own website so

00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:47,220
I authenticate with onea Graham or own

00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:49,650
your swarm using rel me off right I do

00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:52,530
that stop that flow and that's it and

00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:55,590
then from then on if I post something to

00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:57,600
swarm then that service is sort of

00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:00,300
listening for that and and also sends it

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,550
to my microprobe endpoint so now that's

00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:05,130
gone to my website as well so I used

00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:07,200
swarm as an interface for posting to my

00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,720
own site or I post something on

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,020
Instagram and then that also gets sent

00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:16,350
to my own website right so I'm now

00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:19,050
piggybacking on all the hard work of all

00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:21,090
those engineers and designers that have

00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:23,790
built swarm and built Instagram to post

00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:25,159
to my own website so there's an acronym

00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:29,190
for

00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:34,440
pesos posting elsewhere syndicating to

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:36,179
your own site okay which is which is

00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,940
fine and that's good and that's an

00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:41,970
option but there's a better alternative

00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:45,950
which is also an acronym and that's

00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:50,070
Posse and published on your own site and

00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:51,630
syndicate elsewhere now this this option

00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:54,809
sometimes just isn't available in the

00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:57,149
case of Instagram there is no way to

00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:59,460
post something to Instagram other than

00:26:57,149 --> 00:27:01,080
through the app they have an API but

00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,820
there's a very important API method

00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,399
missing which is the ability to actually

00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:07,350
post a photograph you must post through

00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:11,340
Instagram so in the case of Instagram

00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:12,960
you can only do the pesos but in lots of

00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,929
other services you could do the the

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,490
posse right you can syndicate to medium

00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:19,350
you can syndicate to Facebook you can

00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:21,510
syndicate to Twitter and Flickr and and

00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:23,909
many many more so by doing that what you

00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:25,260
do is you benefit from the reach right

00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:26,940
when some people talk about why they

00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:29,070
publish on medium or why they publish

00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:31,200
elsewhere so our reach they've got reach

00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:34,049
well now you got the reach right because

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,789
you're you're giving them copies the

00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:38,820
canonical version is still on your site

00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:40,200
but you're giving copies to these other

00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,870
services kind of like you'd publish an

00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,130
RSS feed right so on my side I've got my

00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,899
own posting interface and you can see

00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,389
I've got set up a little sort of UI

00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:49,830
toggles like they I feel like posting

00:27:48,389 --> 00:27:52,889
this to Twitter I feel like posting mr.

00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:54,419
flicker wherever it's my decision so

00:27:52,889 --> 00:27:56,250
this is a section of my site called

00:27:54,419 --> 00:28:00,840
notes worse this short little updates

00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:03,029
mmm say 140 characters and I publish on

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,980
my own website so here I've I put up a

00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:07,409
photograph of Huxley the awesome dog

00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:10,590
came into the office and that appears on

00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:12,179
my website and it also gets syndicated

00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:14,100
out to Flickr because I had that option

00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:15,630
done and it gets syndicated out to

00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,490
Facebook I'm kind of cheating with the

00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:19,289
Facebook syndication it's simply in the

00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,610
if this then that recipe

00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:22,470
it just looks at my site and every time

00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:25,380
I post something throw it on Facebook

00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:27,840
right or Twitter right I'm posting to

00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:30,330
Twitter so it goes from my side to to

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,830
all these sort of end points I got the

00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:35,039
reach right aha

00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:37,490
you say but what about when over on one

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,470
of these end points somebody responds

00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:44,120
somebody's leaves a comment or they like

00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:46,130
it or they retweet it well I get those

00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:48,500
on my website too I get all of those

00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:50,450
those sent back to me and that's thanks

00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,950
to another building block called web

00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:54,260
mention which is actually much simpler

00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:57,260
than the micro pub again it's it's an

00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,090
endpoint and it accepts post requests

00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:01,010
but it's it's super simple request is

00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:03,860
just this URL over here

00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:05,990
claims to be linking to a URL on your

00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:10,130
website that's it it's basically a ping

00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:13,280
it's like I'm pinging your website so

00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:15,440
you link to URL on my site great but I

00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,760
don't know about this link right because

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,540
that's the way the web is designed one

00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:22,160
way links but then again I get a ping

00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,750
and now I know oh okay then I can

00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,610
investigate and I can say is it really

00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,710
linking to something in my site what do

00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:30,410
I want to do with that right so you can

00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:32,750
ping my web mention endpoint and I can

00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:34,130
verify that link and then it's up to me

00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:36,410
what I do with that information do I

00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:38,440
publish it as a comment do I do I

00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:40,520
mention it somehow so that's of me um

00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,200
and you don't actually even have to host

00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,200
your own web mention endpoint as a

00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,540
service called web mention I oh it's

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,010
kind of like a an answering center for

00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,660
your pings right you can sort of check

00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:52,910
in and say you know any pings for me

00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:54,800
today kind of like a you know an

00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:57,200
old-school telephone operator I guess

00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:00,350
right an answering service and there's a

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,559
really great service called bridgie

00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:04,970
which acts as a translation service so I

00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:06,980
pointed out that you know somebody

00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:09,410
leaves a comment on Twitter or Flickr or

00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:12,110
something and I receive that on my site

00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:14,120
Twitter is not sending web mention pings

00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:16,790
to my site that is not something that

00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:19,490
Twitter provides by default but this

00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:21,290
bridgie service will do that for you so

00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:23,360
you authenticate with bridgie using

00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:25,040
exactly the same flow using the as long

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,080
as you have the rel equals me links on

00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,840
your website you're good to go and then

00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:32,330
it monitors the activity on Twitter

00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:34,990
Flickr and a bunch of other places it

00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:37,880
lists there and then translates a

00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:41,320
response on Twitter or like or retweet

00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,910
into a into a ping or web mention ping

00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,190
so and then I get to decide what I do

00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:48,080
with that and things my endpoint so in

00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:50,900
this case you know people respond I get

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,480
these I get those pings into my site and

00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,250
I'm

00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,350
I'm displaying them in a fairly dull

00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:57,570
boring way it was like little comments

00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:59,610
and there's a share and Alexis it's it's

00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:01,650
doesn't look great but you can do

00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:03,300
whatever you like this is from the

00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:05,610
website of Drew McClellan and he's got

00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:08,190
this kind of face pile of all the people

00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:09,540
who retweeted or reposted and then it

00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:11,520
displays actual comment slightly

00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:12,750
differently completely up to you what

00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,820
you do with it

00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:17,010
drew along with Rachel is going to be

00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:21,060
speaking later one of the people behind

00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:24,270
the perch CMS which is a whole bunch of

00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:26,160
these technologies now built in and many

00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:29,100
CMS's do so if you if you are interested

00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,660
in having a web mention end point and a

00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,770
micro pub end point you don't

00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,240
necessarily have to build it from

00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,490
scratch somebody's probably already done

00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:39,180
it for you if you're using a CMS like

00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:40,950
perch or Jekyll or WordPress or Kirby

00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,150
some somebody's probably done the work

00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:45,750
for you so you don't have to make

00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:48,140
everything from scratch so with a few

00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:51,900
building blocks right rel equals me

00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:54,480
micro pub web mentions you get to have

00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:56,400
that control of your own data but you

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,530
get to take advantage of the the

00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,600
convenience you get to take advantage of

00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:03,930
the fact that everyone's on Facebook or

00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:07,500
everyone's on Twitter you get to benefit

00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:10,860
from Metcalfe's law right balancing that

00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,090
control with that convenience but I just

00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:14,610
want to end by saying that these these

00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:17,730
technologies I've shown rel equals me

00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:20,550
micro pub web mentions they're actually

00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:23,100
not the real building blocks of the web

00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:24,450
or the indie web you can find the real

00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,850
building blocks when you go to this URL

00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:29,490
which is the design principles of of the

00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:31,470
indie web and they're very clear to say

00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,880
like don't focus on the technologies

00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:34,710
it's not actually the technologies that

00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,950
matter you know we can switch up our

00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:40,440
technologies you know focus on the

00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:42,900
experience and make tools for yourself

00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,940
first right and then see about helping

00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,110
others take advantage of that like I

00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,460
said all these people who build plug-ins

00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:50,220
for these CMS's right

00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:52,110
they were scratching their own itch but

00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:55,020
I think that the most important design

00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:56,610
principle on the list is the final one

00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:59,670
which is

00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:03,059
have fun and the emoji is part of the

00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:05,760
design principle that the web can still

00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:09,570
be this wild and wonderful place right

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:11,970
yeah lawless and chaotic but but fun

00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,960
and one of the reasons for having your

00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,520
own website you know I mentioned some

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,100
earlier the longevity having control

00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:19,140
over your data sure but just having a

00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,630
