00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:12,854
today is March 9th, thank you for joining us

00:00:12,854 --> 00:00:14,501
for the third presentation of the

00:00:14,501 --> 00:00:16,354
Tech Speakers Master Class Series,

00:00:16,354 --> 00:00:19,851
in the fifth week of the Winter 2017 Tech Speakers Cohort,

00:00:19,851 --> 00:00:22,375

00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,091
Our Tech Speakers may remember Denise from Berlin,

00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:35,187
she's served as a professional speaking coach,

00:00:35,187 --> 00:00:37,944
for our Tech Speakers, over the last summer.

00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:39,712
Today, as I mentioned, she'll be presenting

00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:41,109
Graceful Ways with Q & A,

00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:43,661
and Denise is a professional speaking consultant,

00:00:43,661 --> 00:00:44,736

we'll be monitoring questions,

00:00:55,827 --> 00:00:57,759
in the Tech Speakers IRC Channel,

00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,534
additionally, we'll be monitoring questions

00:00:59,534 --> 00:01:02,319
in the Telegram Channel for our Tech Speakers as well,

00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:04,499
so please join me in welcoming Denise.

00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:06,749
(applause)

00:01:08,732 --> 00:01:11,947
- Thanks Michael, and I have a question before we start

00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:14,653
talking about questions, and that is,

00:01:14,653 --> 00:01:18,353
does anyone have any questions for my answers?

00:01:18,353 --> 00:01:20,662
That's something that a U.S. Secretary of State

00:01:20,662 --> 00:01:24,488
said before a news conference a long time ago,

00:01:24,488 --> 00:01:25,803
and it was little bit of a joke,

00:01:25,803 --> 00:01:28,148
he was trying to get the reporters to laugh.

00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:31,477
But I think he actually gave away a secret,

00:01:31,477 --> 00:01:33,701
and that is that most speakers

00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:35,639
would really love Q & A,

00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:37,946
if they thought that people had questions

00:01:37,946 --> 00:01:42,105
that fit their answers perfectly, right.

00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:44,736
And it's where we don't have questions

00:01:44,736 --> 00:01:46,583
that fit our answers perfectly,

00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:49,214
that speakers get nervous about Q & A.

00:01:49,214 --> 00:01:51,438
Now some speakers love Q & A,

00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:52,794
I've worked with a lot of speakers,

00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:54,820
and some of them say me,

00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,737
I hate presenting, but I love Q & A.

00:01:57,737 --> 00:01:58,645
And why is that?

00:01:58,645 --> 00:02:00,494
I think that's because they don't,

00:02:00,494 --> 00:02:03,255
they feel confined by the presentation,

00:02:03,255 --> 00:02:04,730
they feel they have to memorize,

00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,575
they feel they have to look and sound like an expert.

00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:11,253
But they feel more like an expert during Q & A,

00:02:11,253 --> 00:02:13,474
and it's true that Q & A is a great way

00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:14,960
for you to establish yourself

00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,614
and your expertise, with great credibility.

00:02:18,614 --> 00:02:20,873
So I think that's why some speakers love it,

00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:25,040
but others really worry that Q & A is not predictable.

00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:28,008
So they worry they can embarrass themselves,

00:02:28,008 --> 00:02:30,186
they may not know the answer to a question,

00:02:30,186 --> 00:02:32,317
they may not look like an expert, right,

00:02:32,317 --> 00:02:34,781
they may not feel like an expert.

00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:35,724
So that's a big issue,

00:02:35,724 --> 00:02:38,643
and it's a big issue early in your career as well,

00:02:38,643 --> 00:02:39,921
you know, but it's,

00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:42,424
I have to tell the people who are early in their careers,

00:02:42,424 --> 00:02:44,275
there are people who are very senior,

00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:46,774
who feel the same way for the rest of their lives.

00:02:46,774 --> 00:02:49,104
I think you don't have to feel that way,

00:02:49,104 --> 00:02:53,255
and a lot of it involves preparation for Q & A.

00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:56,537
When you ask a question, or you answer a question,

00:02:56,537 --> 00:02:59,865
you are actually giving a very short speech.

00:02:59,865 --> 00:03:03,184
But most of us don't think about it that way, right,

00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:04,406
and you should plan,

00:03:04,406 --> 00:03:06,872
if you're in the audience asking questions,

00:03:06,872 --> 00:03:08,434
you should plan your question.

00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:09,868
If you're standing up

00:03:09,868 --> 00:03:11,957
in front of the room answering questions,

00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:13,766
you should be planning your answers as well,

00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:15,944
and we'll talk about that today.

00:03:15,944 --> 00:03:19,141
You also get to moderate the discussion in the room,

00:03:19,141 --> 00:03:22,505
generally, if you're a single speaker,

00:03:22,505 --> 00:03:24,181
you'll be moderating the questions,

00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:27,098
you'll be choosing the people who ask the questions,

00:03:27,098 --> 00:03:30,028
you'll be deciding how long your answers are.

00:03:30,028 --> 00:03:32,658
So all of that involves planning as well.

00:03:32,658 --> 00:03:34,667
And you know, Q & A is an opportunity

00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:36,267
to make yourself look great,

00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:38,807
you can look casual and relaxed,

00:03:38,807 --> 00:03:41,272
you can look on point,

00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:43,367
you can be very decisive sounding,

00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:45,869
and you can be very expert in, you know,

00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:48,001
expert like to the audience,

00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:50,917
by looking knowledgeable, by looking insightful,

00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:52,477
by sharing your perspective.

00:03:52,477 --> 00:03:54,903
So I think there is a world of possibility for Q & A,

00:03:54,903 --> 00:03:59,070
and today, I've got three things I really want to focus on,

00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:02,555
for how to have Graceful Ways with Q & A,

00:04:03,488 --> 00:04:06,234
and that's to plan your Q & A,

00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:09,238
to predict the questions that you're going to get,

00:04:09,238 --> 00:04:12,725
and I believe you can, very easily predict them

00:04:12,725 --> 00:04:14,164
maybe not in the way you think.

00:04:14,164 --> 00:04:18,331
And then to problem solve question and answer time,

00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,333
both in advance and in real time,

00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,389
because in fact, no matter how much planning you do,

00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:25,394
there's is always going to be

00:04:25,394 --> 00:04:27,160
a question you didn't anticipate.

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,595
So we'll talk about all of that.

00:04:28,595 --> 00:04:30,730
So first, let's talk about planning,

00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,559
and by planning Q & A, really what I mean is,

00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:36,019
you need to start planning your presentation

00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:39,552
by planning the question time first.

00:04:39,552 --> 00:04:42,259
And this is something that most speakers do not do,

00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:45,787
so I would say 99% of my clients,

00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:48,175
make the presentation and then sit down and say,

00:04:48,175 --> 00:04:50,099
what kind of questions am I going to get?

00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:53,634
Or, if they anticipate the questions first, they say,

00:04:53,634 --> 00:04:56,014
ah, I'm going to get a question about this,

00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:57,533
so I'll put it in the presentation,

00:04:57,533 --> 00:05:00,244
and that way, I won't get a question about this, right.

00:05:00,244 --> 00:05:02,583
So they try to inoculate the presentation

00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,249
against getting that question.

00:05:05,249 --> 00:05:08,402
But in fact, I also have clients

00:05:08,402 --> 00:05:09,510
who come to me and say, you know what,

00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,214
I didn't get any questions,

00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:14,234
the last time that I spoke.

00:05:14,234 --> 00:05:15,875
Why is that?

00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,130
And part of the reason you don't get questions is

00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,874
that you included too much information in your presentation.

00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:25,569
You didn't leave the audience anything to ask,

00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:27,956
so you know, there's no presentation that really

00:05:27,956 --> 00:05:31,823
can contain 100% of the knowledge on that topic.

00:05:31,823 --> 00:05:35,108
No matter how much you try, right.

00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:37,816
But you need to be able to leave some things

00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:39,832
for the audience to ask.

00:05:39,832 --> 00:05:42,783
So the first step is to say,

00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,226
you know, what questions do I believe I'm going to

00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:48,726
get from this particular audience.

00:05:48,726 --> 00:05:52,585
If you know the audience, sometimes that's easy to guess,

00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,550
sometimes people will tell you,

00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,594
sometimes you have a tool that will let you solicit

00:05:57,594 --> 00:06:01,495
questions in advance, and you should always use that.

00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:05,662
You can also think about questions that you expect,

00:06:06,303 --> 00:06:09,170
and leave that content out of your presentation.

00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:13,337
Now I know that's a bit of challenge for some people,

00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:16,067
and some people would say, that doesn't make sense to them,

00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:17,092
and that's fine.

00:06:17,092 --> 00:06:19,724
But I guarantee you, if you know that you're to get

00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:21,940
a question about something,

00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,745
and you leave it our of your presentation,

00:06:23,745 --> 00:06:26,496
you will get that question, and guess what,

00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:28,386
then you already know the answer.

00:06:28,386 --> 00:06:31,312
So far from being in the position

00:06:31,312 --> 00:06:33,810
of not having an answer ready,

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,414
you look great, you look smart,

00:06:35,414 --> 00:06:38,204
because you've anticipated that you will get that question,

00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:40,996
you've anticipated you will get that answer.

00:06:40,996 --> 00:06:44,579
And then you can proceed to plan the Q & A,

00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:47,808
in a way that makes sense to you.

00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:48,961
Now a lot of speakers,

00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:50,967
when they're planning their presentations,

00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:54,493
just choose to leave out Q & A time entirely,

00:06:54,493 --> 00:06:57,072
they take up the entire amount of time

00:06:57,072 --> 00:06:58,672
that's stated on the program,

00:06:58,672 --> 00:07:02,534
or if the organizer says, we're going to speak,

00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:05,327
you're going to speak for an hour,

00:07:05,327 --> 00:07:09,494
they take up 59 minutes and 32 seconds of the hour, right.

00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:12,108
So there's really no time for questions.

00:07:12,108 --> 00:07:16,275
And that's a tactic, so it's a tactic for a couple reasons,

00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:19,409
there are speakers who believe that they must

00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:23,181
get as much time as possible out of every presentation.

00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:26,501
And they believe that time for you to ask a question,

00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:29,209
is time they don't get to talk,

00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:33,188
this is incorrect, but that's the feeling with some.

00:07:33,188 --> 00:07:35,891
There's also, I see a couple of other trends,

00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:38,737
one is, the TED Conference, I coach speakers for the

00:07:38,737 --> 00:07:42,106
TEDMED Conference and for a lot of TEDx Conferences,

00:07:42,106 --> 00:07:46,273
and as you probably know, for the last 25 or 30 years,

00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,933
TED has simply had no Q & A,

00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:51,320
there is not an opportunity for Q & A.

00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,174
The only exception to that,

00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:55,560
is when we have a speaker who is a celebrity,

00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,581
typically, who is interviewed on stage by somebody

00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:02,007
from the, from the show, right.

00:08:02,007 --> 00:08:04,017
So that's the only questioning

00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,316
that really happens at a TED Conference.

00:08:06,316 --> 00:08:07,670
And there's a reason for that,

00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,278
the people who created TED,

00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:11,124
decided the Q & A was not something

00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,361
that they wanted to include,

00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:14,860
so they very decidedly left it out.

00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,429
I see a lot of conferences now that do the same,

00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:20,445
so they're going for shorter talks,

00:08:20,445 --> 00:08:24,112
less Q & A, less interaction from the stage,

00:08:25,278 --> 00:08:26,714
but as at the TED Conferences,

00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,645
speakers are expected to mingle,

00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:32,587
and connect in real, you know, in person,

00:08:32,587 --> 00:08:35,333
off the stage, at breaks, or at meals,

00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,758
or other parts of the event.

00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:40,881
So it's possible to have that interaction, you know,

00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:45,048
one to one, as opposed to one to 1,000, or 1,500.

00:08:45,237 --> 00:08:46,720
But for some people,

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,898
they really would like to ask questions, right.

00:08:48,898 --> 00:08:52,545
So when you have big ideas, like you do at TED Conferences,

00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:55,427
they provoke a lot of thinking in the audience,

00:08:55,427 --> 00:08:57,522
and people do want Q & A,

00:08:57,522 --> 00:09:00,477
they're not going to be satisfied at a TED Conference.

00:09:00,477 --> 00:09:01,790
I also see, you know,

00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,800
I blog about women and public speaking, as Michael said,

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,050
and I see a lot of my clients in other,

00:09:08,137 --> 00:09:11,307
particularly young women in tech,

00:09:11,307 --> 00:09:13,031
in this industry in particular,

00:09:13,031 --> 00:09:16,604
who omit Q & A, because they're afraid of getting

00:09:16,604 --> 00:09:20,546
trolled or harassed during the question time.

00:09:20,546 --> 00:09:22,837
And it's true that some people

00:09:22,837 --> 00:09:25,219
take advantage of the open opportunity

00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:29,386
to ask questions to bedevil the speaker, right.

00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:31,664
This doesn't happen exclusively to women,

00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:33,550
but it happens a lot to women,

00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:36,546
and so as a protective measure,

00:09:36,546 --> 00:09:38,064
many women are saying that's it,

00:09:38,064 --> 00:09:39,628
I'm going to speak for all 60 minutes

00:09:39,628 --> 00:09:41,105
of my 60 minute talk,

00:09:41,105 --> 00:09:43,480
or all 20 minutes of my 20 minute talk.

00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,318
And that's certainly a decision you can make for yourself,

00:09:46,318 --> 00:09:48,261
if you feel at risk, and I've certainly had

00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:52,428
clients who have been harassed during and after their talks,

00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:55,330
I don't blame them one moment

00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,350
for protecting themselves in such a way,

00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,895
however, what I will say to you is,

00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:04,343
you're losing an opportunity with Q & A.

00:10:04,343 --> 00:10:06,473
To establish your credibility,

00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:09,106
to figure out how to deal with that questioner

00:10:09,106 --> 00:10:12,056
in a powerful way, and believe me,

00:10:12,056 --> 00:10:14,149
the rest of the audience would, you know,

00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:16,484
if you get a harassing or a trolling question,

00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:18,663
the rest of the audience is going to be on your side,

00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:20,347
not on that person's side.

00:10:20,347 --> 00:10:22,641
So sometimes it's very powerful

00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:26,808
for you to find a way to keep them under control in Q & A,

00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:31,145
or make it clear that what they're doing is unacceptable.

00:10:31,145 --> 00:10:33,852
And that's certainly your right as well as a speaker.

00:10:33,852 --> 00:10:36,396
I often encourage people to take the time

00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:38,204
to look for a code of conduct

00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,426
of the conferences you're speaking at,

00:10:40,426 --> 00:10:43,212
where that kind of behavior should not be allowed,

00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:45,752
and if you are moderating at such a conference,

00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:48,053
you should be announcing the code of conduct,

00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:49,529
or someone who's introducing you,

00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:51,504
should be announcing that code of conduct

00:10:51,504 --> 00:10:52,902
before you begin speaking,

00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,433
just to make those rules perfectly clear to the room.

00:10:56,433 --> 00:10:58,351
So I would advocate for you

00:10:58,351 --> 00:11:00,777
to think about planning your Q & A,

00:11:00,777 --> 00:11:03,033
and including in your plan,

00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:07,200
two or three answers that you can have in your back pocket,

00:11:07,345 --> 00:11:09,606
for that interruption that's

00:11:09,606 --> 00:11:12,191
going to cause you trouble or pain,

00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:13,546
and to figure out how you,

00:11:13,546 --> 00:11:15,814
sometimes you can do it in a funny way,

00:11:15,814 --> 00:11:19,600
sometimes you can do it in a more forceful way.

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,806
But if you've rehearsed ahead of time, a few answers,

00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:25,969
you may want to do this with a partner or a friend,

00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:28,356
figure out some things that you can say,

00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:32,213
that would be a counter to that person.

00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:36,380
I had a colleague who worked in an academic department,

00:11:37,966 --> 00:11:41,787
and for about the first five years of her post

00:11:41,787 --> 00:11:43,918
on this particular faculty,

00:11:43,918 --> 00:11:47,998
a male colleague would come, sit in the back of the room,

00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,748
and ask the very first question all the time.

00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:53,659
My first question to her was,

00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:56,581
why do you keep calling on him?

00:11:56,581 --> 00:11:58,139
Right, so you do have some control

00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:02,306
in terms of whom you indicate can ask a question,

00:12:02,412 --> 00:12:06,318
but every single time he would begin to berate her,

00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:10,485
in front of all of her colleagues, for leaving things out.

00:12:10,578 --> 00:12:13,654
And of course, you're not up here to be an encyclopedia,

00:12:13,654 --> 00:12:16,322
you're here to curate a particular

00:12:16,322 --> 00:12:18,209
experience as the speaker.

00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:19,856
But in her case,

00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:23,670
it would just cause her to blush very deeply.

00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,773
And we worked on some things that she could say to him,

00:12:27,773 --> 00:12:29,170
and it turned out that he really showed up

00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,595
so routinely to her talks,

00:12:31,595 --> 00:12:33,888
and I know some of you may have had this experience,

00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:38,055
you have your own personal troll, who shows up.

00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,718
So I gave her a line that actually comes

00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,182
from President Ronald Reagan, which is,

00:12:43,182 --> 00:12:45,192
and I don't often quote him but,

00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:47,950
during the debates with Jimmy Carter,

00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,777
Jimmy Carter would make a point,

00:12:49,777 --> 00:12:52,538
and very effectively, Ronald Reagan would shake his head,

00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:56,705
with a big smile and say, there you go again.

00:12:57,032 --> 00:12:58,615
There you go again.

00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:01,848
And it would get a big laugh.

00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,164
And what are you doing there?

00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:04,720
Let's break that down,

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,112
so everybody understands what I'm talking about.

00:13:07,112 --> 00:13:09,409
First of all, you're being non-anxious,

00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:11,256
which is the role of the speaker,

00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:13,395
and I know those of you who are anxious speakers

00:13:13,395 --> 00:13:15,949
are thinking, how can I possibly be non-anxious,

00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:18,873
but you need to at least appear non-anxious.

00:13:18,873 --> 00:13:22,326
And using humor is one way to do that.

00:13:22,326 --> 00:13:24,660
When you say, there you go again,

00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,103
it's an acknowledgement that Fred or Jim

00:13:28,103 --> 00:13:32,256
is doing this repeatedly, without you having to say,

00:13:32,256 --> 00:13:35,132
Fred, you're always doing that to me repeatedly, right.

00:13:35,132 --> 00:13:36,647
So you don't have to be that way.

00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:38,984
And it signals the audience,

00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,556
it's a way of connecting with the audience to say,

00:13:41,556 --> 00:13:45,723
hey everybody, I know what's going on here, and so do you.

00:13:45,907 --> 00:13:48,038
And that's why the audience laughs,

00:13:48,038 --> 00:13:50,092
most audiences want the speaker

00:13:50,092 --> 00:13:51,484
to be in control of the room,

00:13:51,484 --> 00:13:53,292
they don't want the troll in the back

00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,146
to be in control of the room.

00:13:55,146 --> 00:13:56,676
So the audience will generally be with you

00:13:56,676 --> 00:14:00,773
for that kind of experience, it's a great way to handle it.

00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,866
When you're planning your presentation and your Q & A,

00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:06,821
you also may want to consider a couple of novel ways

00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:08,009
of handling Q & A.

00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:11,993
One of those, would be to begin with questions,

00:14:11,993 --> 00:14:15,111
before you ever do your presentation.

00:14:15,111 --> 00:14:17,290
I recommend this a lot for situations

00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,430
where you are speaking to an audience,

00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:23,597
and you're not sure about the knowledge level in the room.

00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:25,584
So that would be an audience where you have

00:14:25,584 --> 00:14:29,751
lots of novices, as well as people with deep expertise,

00:14:30,096 --> 00:14:31,979
and for most expert speakers,

00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:34,363
that's a really challenging audience.

00:14:34,363 --> 00:14:37,975
You can't make it simple enough for the novices,

00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:39,700
and you don't want to bore the people

00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,654
who have the same level of knowledge as you.

00:14:42,654 --> 00:14:45,364
So the easiest way to solve that,

00:14:45,364 --> 00:14:47,581
is to start with questions,

00:14:47,581 --> 00:14:49,675
and I generally will say,

00:14:49,675 --> 00:14:52,879
I'm going to start with about five minutes of questions,

00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:54,968
so I'll take a few questions now,

00:14:54,968 --> 00:14:58,301
if I can answer them easily, or quickly,

00:14:58,301 --> 00:14:59,898
I'll do that right away,

00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:02,411
if I can't answer them quickly,

00:15:02,411 --> 00:15:04,629
I want you to come back and ask me at the,

00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:07,212
again, at the end of the presentation.

00:15:07,212 --> 00:15:09,020
And after about five minutes of questions,

00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,946
you wrap up that Q & A,

00:15:10,946 --> 00:15:12,877
and go into your presentation.

00:15:12,877 --> 00:15:14,925
Now what does that do for you as a speaker?

00:15:14,925 --> 00:15:18,974
It gives you a clue about who's in the room,

00:15:18,974 --> 00:15:21,515
it gives you a sense of what you may need to add

00:15:21,515 --> 00:15:24,263
to your presentation on the fly.

00:15:24,263 --> 00:15:27,507
And then it releases some tension from the audience,

00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:29,890
so if the audience is anxious,

00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,064
about wanting to ask a particular question,

00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,116
as many audience members are.

00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:36,044
Many people come to your presentation

00:15:36,044 --> 00:15:38,624
with questions in hand, that they want to ask,

00:15:38,624 --> 00:15:41,988
it let's them do that, so it satisfies them.

00:15:41,988 --> 00:15:44,624
You can also use this tactic really effectively,

00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:48,791
if you think you're speaking to an audience that is angry,

00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:51,647
for some reason, whatever reason that would be,

00:15:51,647 --> 00:15:54,654
not necessarily at you, but about the topic.

00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:58,757
So if it's a topic that people have strong feelings about,

00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,344
sometimes you can let that emotion out at the beginning

00:16:01,344 --> 00:16:05,511
by having three to five minutes of questions or comments.

00:16:05,728 --> 00:16:08,561
And the launch into your presentation, right.

00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:10,774
So you can think about doing that.

00:16:10,774 --> 00:16:13,074
You also can consider planning a program

00:16:13,074 --> 00:16:15,245
that's entirely Q & A,

00:16:15,245 --> 00:16:16,555
I thought about that for this,

00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:18,441
but I didn't think it would work as well.

00:16:18,441 --> 00:16:20,695
And I've done many talks where,

00:16:20,695 --> 00:16:22,704
if you are solid in your expertise,

00:16:22,704 --> 00:16:25,366
and you know your topic very well,

00:16:25,366 --> 00:16:28,484
sometimes it's great for the audience to be in charge of

00:16:28,484 --> 00:16:31,685
which way the presentation will go.

00:16:31,685 --> 00:16:34,395
You have to be ready to answer questions of all types,

00:16:34,395 --> 00:16:35,829
in that presentation,

00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:39,996
so it takes, you know, it takes less preparation for you,

00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:42,813
in one sense, and in another sense,

00:16:42,813 --> 00:16:46,510
it's all the preparation you've had in your entire career,

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,561
that comes out in a session like that.

00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:52,092
Audiences really love all Q & A programs,

00:16:52,092 --> 00:16:53,610
they don't get them enough,

00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,040
so it's really an opportunity where

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,243
people come in and feel, wow, I really have a chance

00:16:58,243 --> 00:17:00,336
to get my question answered,

00:17:00,336 --> 00:17:02,305
and, you know, we're not going to be limited

00:17:02,305 --> 00:17:03,987
to three minutes of questions at the end,

00:17:03,987 --> 00:17:06,164
we have the entire hour for questions.

00:17:06,164 --> 00:17:08,136
So that's actually a really effective way

00:17:08,136 --> 00:17:10,516
to get audiences on your side.

00:17:10,516 --> 00:17:11,830
So I think in all those ways,

00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,292
you can plan for a traditional Q & A,

00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:17,861
you can leave questions out that you anticipate happening,

00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:19,994
to make sure that you get questions,

00:17:19,994 --> 00:17:23,521
and you can also manage your questions,

00:17:23,521 --> 00:17:26,397
you can plan an entire session of questions,

00:17:26,397 --> 00:17:28,083
or you can start with questions.

00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,771
So I think, I would encourage everyone to be

00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:32,724
a little more creative with how you use questions

00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:36,665
in your presentations and how you think about them.

00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:39,578
And I want to talk a little bit about predicting questions,

00:17:39,578 --> 00:17:41,711
because I really think you can do this,

00:17:41,711 --> 00:17:44,743
and I think there are three kinds of questions,

00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:46,757
that you can think about in advance.

00:17:46,757 --> 00:17:49,960
And those are the questions you want,

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,547
the questions, because you all, you know you have questions,

00:17:52,547 --> 00:17:54,931
you wish you would get, right.

00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:58,752
Then there are the questions you expect,

00:17:58,752 --> 00:18:01,460
and then everyone's favorite, the questions you fear,

00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,250
or that you're anticipating with dread.

00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,057
And I have a secret to tell you,

00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:07,739
in all the time I've been coaching speakers,

00:18:07,739 --> 00:18:09,872
which is about 30 years,

00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:13,487
most people never get the questions they fear.

00:18:13,487 --> 00:18:15,127
But they spend an enormous amount of time

00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,094
thinking about then in advance.

00:18:17,094 --> 00:18:20,172
And the downside is, they spend a lot less time

00:18:20,172 --> 00:18:23,039
thinking about the questions they want,

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,093
or the questions they expect,

00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:28,004
and then when they get the question that they want,

00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:30,813
they don't know how to answer it,

00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:33,442
or they don't have something ready.

00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:35,244
And so they don't sound prepared,

00:18:35,244 --> 00:18:36,884
but if it's a question you really want,

00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:38,569
you want to be able to pounce on that question

00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:40,914
and give a really great, really strong answer,

00:18:40,914 --> 00:18:44,441
so I would encourage you to think about the nice questions,

00:18:44,441 --> 00:18:46,452
the questions you want first.

00:18:46,452 --> 00:18:48,586
And think about the questions that you're afraid of,

00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,296
but don't let them overtake you,

00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,452
in terms of creating anxiety before your presentation.

00:18:54,452 --> 00:18:55,805
I think a lot of people overthink

00:18:55,805 --> 00:18:57,942
that part of the presentation,

00:18:57,942 --> 00:18:59,051
we're all really good at the

00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:01,515
critical part of critical thinking.

00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,768
So don't be too critical,

00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,558
don't be too questioning of your questions,

00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:08,689
and I think that will make a difference.

00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,492
You know, I mentioned earlier,

00:19:10,492 --> 00:19:13,733
your presentation really should not include

00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:15,337
the questions you expect,

00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:18,944
or answers to the questions you expect.

00:19:18,944 --> 00:19:23,111
Some people also get themselves into an anxiety situation,

00:19:24,607 --> 00:19:27,686
because they anticipate no questions,

00:19:27,686 --> 00:19:30,332
and I've had this discussion back and forth

00:19:30,332 --> 00:19:33,573
with readers of my blog, who will say,

00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:35,956
what if I don't get any questions?

00:19:35,956 --> 00:19:37,928
And the way I would normally answer that would be

00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:41,174
to talk about planning and preparing ahead of time.

00:19:41,174 --> 00:19:43,146
So I've done posts about that,

00:19:43,146 --> 00:19:44,740
and then I'll get mail that says, no, really,

00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,746
what if I don't get any questions?

00:19:46,746 --> 00:19:49,039
So there are some people who spend

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,710
a lot of time anticipating everything that might go wrong,

00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,914
and that's useful up to a point,

00:19:54,914 --> 00:19:56,888
but if you don't get any questions, you know,

00:19:56,888 --> 00:19:59,594
first of all, if you haven't planned your presentation

00:19:59,594 --> 00:20:01,677
to leave some things out,

00:20:02,793 --> 00:20:05,829
and you don't get any actual questions,

00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,122
the crowd is just quiet.

00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:11,239
The first thing you need to do is wait,

00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:14,923
right, because just as it's tough for speakers to get up

00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:18,042
and speak here at a lectern,

00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:20,464
it's difficult for people to get up and say,

00:20:20,464 --> 00:20:21,857
I have a question.

00:20:21,857 --> 00:20:24,198
So you need to give them a little bit of time,

00:20:24,198 --> 00:20:27,066
and if you wait and there is still no questions,

00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:30,636
invite some questions with something specific.

00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:32,893
So say, for example,

00:20:32,893 --> 00:20:37,060
I'm wondering how many of you really take the time

00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:40,489
to think about leaving out particular information

00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,689
in your presentations, can I have a show of hands?

00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:45,660
So you might want to take a poll of the room.

00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,969
That might be an easier way for people

00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:49,970
to take part in the conversation.

00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,225
Or you may want to ask a more specific question

00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:53,952
and get things going.

00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,883
And if in fact, there really are no questions,

00:20:55,883 --> 00:20:58,260
after you've done all of those things,

00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,929
say, thank you so much, I'm going to be hanging around

00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:02,652
in the hallway after the talk,

00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:04,830
so if anyone wants to come see me,

00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,062
please feel free to ask your question privately.

00:21:08,062 --> 00:21:09,864
Please know, that there are a lot of people

00:21:09,864 --> 00:21:12,372
who will never get up to ask you a question, right.

00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:14,629
So 100% of your audience

00:21:14,629 --> 00:21:16,965
is not going to raise their hands,

00:21:16,965 --> 00:21:18,654
at any point in time.

00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,503
There are a lot of people who are too introverted

00:21:20,503 --> 00:21:22,556
to ask a question in front of others,

00:21:22,556 --> 00:21:24,480
but they will come see you afterwards.

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,820
So it's not a fault,

00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,537
but I would say you should aim to have questions,

00:21:29,537 --> 00:21:31,623
you should hope to have questions,

00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,385
and you should plan to have questions,

00:21:33,385 --> 00:21:35,438
and that really makes a difference.

00:21:35,438 --> 00:21:36,298
But I do think you can take

00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:39,535
anticipating the questions too far,

00:21:39,535 --> 00:21:43,319
I have a lot of clients who refer to practicing

00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:45,120
their presentations, and they practice Q & A,

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,294
with colleagues, and they say,

00:21:47,294 --> 00:21:49,546
we're going to have a murder board.

00:21:49,546 --> 00:21:51,717
And I said, that's great, very pleasant, you know,

00:21:51,717 --> 00:21:53,481
that's, that tells me you have the right attitude

00:21:53,481 --> 00:21:55,655
about Q & A, not really.

00:21:55,655 --> 00:21:59,265
So you want to think about it as a time when

00:21:59,265 --> 00:22:02,932
you can be relaxed, be open to the question,

00:22:04,393 --> 00:22:05,711
and show what you know,

00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:07,270
and not necessarily spend all your time

00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:11,437
anticipating a negative experience with your questions.

00:22:12,227 --> 00:22:14,398
So let me talk now about problem solving,

00:22:14,398 --> 00:22:16,659
because I think that's really the biggest part of Q & A,

00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:19,164
for speakers, whether you're problem solving in advance,

00:22:19,164 --> 00:22:21,313
and we've talked about a few ways to do that.

00:22:21,313 --> 00:22:23,236
Or you're problem solving on the fly,

00:22:23,236 --> 00:22:26,684
which is much more common for speakers.

00:22:26,684 --> 00:22:29,393
I think one of the biggest problems for most speakers,

00:22:29,393 --> 00:22:31,775
is that they fear or they worry,

00:22:31,775 --> 00:22:35,298
that they have to be the expert on their topic.

00:22:35,298 --> 00:22:38,536
So they have to be 100% knowledgeable

00:22:38,536 --> 00:22:40,998
about 100% of the facts in the field,

00:22:40,998 --> 00:22:42,680
and that's just not the case.

00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,374
So we want you to be not the expert,

00:22:46,374 --> 00:22:50,026
but we expect you to be an expert, right,

00:22:50,026 --> 00:22:52,411
so I hope that takes some pressure off of you.

00:22:52,411 --> 00:22:55,695
You know, you're sharing your own perspective,

00:22:55,695 --> 00:22:59,350
which is unique, that's enough for most presentations.

00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:03,249
We're not actually expecting you to be the encyclopedia.

00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:07,416
I mentioned earlier that if you can develop a non-anxious

00:23:07,936 --> 00:23:12,103
feeling within yourself, about questions, that's the best.

00:23:12,621 --> 00:23:14,590
Because I think, too often,

00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,840
the person receiving the questions,

00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,041
ends up reacting to the content of the question,

00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:22,632
or the emotion of the question.

00:23:22,632 --> 00:23:25,388
And that's just really difficult,

00:23:25,388 --> 00:23:28,225
your goal should be not to react to the question,

00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:32,392
but to respond to the question, two different things.

00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:33,331
In my world,

00:23:33,331 --> 00:23:37,498
reacting to the question has a lot more emotion.

00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:41,412
Responding to the question doesn't have much emotion at all.

00:23:41,412 --> 00:23:42,930
So be a little more neutral

00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,345
in the way that you handle the question,

00:23:45,345 --> 00:23:47,770
and the way you think about the question.

00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,863
You may hate the question, right,

00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:51,214
you may despise the question,

00:23:51,214 --> 00:23:53,388
or maybe the question you fear the most.

00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:55,316
But the way you handle the answer

00:23:55,316 --> 00:23:58,067
should be to simply respond to the question,

00:23:58,067 --> 00:24:00,656
and not to make the question bigger or smaller

00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:03,323
than what the person asks, okay.

00:24:05,293 --> 00:24:07,965
When you're moderating the room for questions,

00:24:07,965 --> 00:24:09,611
I also want to make a plea to everybody,

00:24:09,611 --> 00:24:13,138
to think about gender and diversity

00:24:13,138 --> 00:24:16,172
in your calling on audience members.

00:24:16,172 --> 00:24:20,339
There are reams of stories about women being ignored,

00:24:21,422 --> 00:24:22,533
when they have their hands up

00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:24,358
to ask questions in audiences.

00:24:24,358 --> 00:24:26,408
Cheryl Sandberg, the CEO of Facebook,

00:24:26,408 --> 00:24:29,531
tells a story about this in one of her talks,

00:24:29,531 --> 00:24:32,408
where a young woman came up to her after the talk,

00:24:32,408 --> 00:24:36,140
and said, you know, I had my hand up the whole time,

00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,809
and then you said, she said to Cheryl Sandberg,

00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:42,964
and then you said, I'm only going to take one more question,

00:24:42,964 --> 00:24:46,450
and you called on a guy, and then you called on another guy,

00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,244
but I had already put my hand down.

00:24:49,244 --> 00:24:52,448
And so that just woke her up to, you know,

00:24:52,448 --> 00:24:53,311
I have to pay attention to

00:24:53,311 --> 00:24:56,386
who I'm calling on in the audience.

00:24:56,386 --> 00:24:58,566
So I think a great, there's a simple way to do this,

00:24:58,566 --> 00:25:01,067
you can announce it, if you want to,

00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:03,079
that would be a great thing for the people in your audience,

00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:05,784
you can say, I'm going to call on a guy and a gal,

00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:07,097
and a guy and a gal,

00:25:07,097 --> 00:25:09,516
or a gal and guy, and a gal and a guy.

00:25:09,516 --> 00:25:11,529
Or you don't have to say anything at all,

00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:13,542
but just do it, right,

00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:16,045
just make sure that you're being inclusive

00:25:16,045 --> 00:25:17,809
when you're calling on different people.

00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:20,889
And do call on people from all the way around the room,

00:25:20,889 --> 00:25:24,502
one of the common complaints I hear from audiences,

00:25:24,502 --> 00:25:26,633
is that the speaker only dealt with the people

00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:28,765
in front of her or him.

00:25:28,765 --> 00:25:31,648
So make sure you're looking at that person in the back row,

00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,534
or on the side of the room as well.

00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:36,585
Let's talk about some other kinds of problem solving,

00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:40,752
so sometimes, you get a question, and it's very cryptic,

00:25:42,611 --> 00:25:45,241
and it's not really clear where the speaker

00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:47,324
of the question is going.

00:25:48,611 --> 00:25:51,072
So it's totally fair for the speaker then,

00:25:51,072 --> 00:25:53,982
to ask some questions of your own, right.

00:25:53,982 --> 00:25:55,707
Tell me what you mean by that?

00:25:55,707 --> 00:25:58,005
Tell me a little bit more about that question,

00:25:58,005 --> 00:25:59,319
help me understand what it is you're really

00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:01,494
trying to get at here.

00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:04,245
Why to ask it in just that way?

00:26:04,245 --> 00:26:06,382
And if you lead these open ended questions

00:26:06,382 --> 00:26:09,625
back to the questioner, you're starting a conversation,

00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:12,091
which is a great way to connect with an audience.

00:26:12,091 --> 00:26:15,128
But you're also learning about what they really meant,

00:26:15,128 --> 00:26:17,718
rather than jumping to a conclusion.

00:26:17,718 --> 00:26:20,136
So it's really important as the speaker,

00:26:20,136 --> 00:26:21,655
not to make too many assumptions

00:26:21,655 --> 00:26:23,712
about the question you're getting, okay.

00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:26,014
Again, if you have a non-anxious,

00:26:26,014 --> 00:26:29,664
nonreactive stance to any question,

00:26:29,664 --> 00:26:32,283
you should be welcoming of all questions,

00:26:32,283 --> 00:26:33,847
and not feeling like you know what

00:26:33,847 --> 00:26:36,226
the question is really about.

00:26:36,226 --> 00:26:38,868
There's a wonderful new book out, by Frank Sesno,

00:26:38,868 --> 00:26:41,908
who's a former CNN reporter,

00:26:41,908 --> 00:26:44,047
and it's called Ask More.

00:26:44,047 --> 00:26:45,444
And what I like about is,

00:26:45,444 --> 00:26:47,738
he describes, he spent a lifetime

00:26:47,738 --> 00:26:49,870
asking people questions for a living,

00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:52,293
so he spends different chapters talking about

00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:54,551
different types of questions.

00:26:54,551 --> 00:26:56,273
And I really recommend it to people

00:26:56,273 --> 00:26:58,698
who are going to be doing a lot of Q & A sessions,

00:26:58,698 --> 00:27:02,838
because, I didn't personally realize or think about,

00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:05,339
how many types of questions there are.

00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:07,059
And some of these, he gives you,

00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,452
you can use them in real life,

00:27:08,452 --> 00:27:10,752
you can use them in personal relationships,

00:27:10,752 --> 00:27:12,679
but I read the book with the filter of

00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:14,612
looking what speakers can learn.

00:27:14,612 --> 00:27:15,762
And I think it's useful,

00:27:15,762 --> 00:27:17,610
because it just helps you understand,

00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:20,484
there are some questions that are diagnostic,

00:27:20,484 --> 00:27:22,903
there are some that are confrontational,

00:27:22,903 --> 00:27:24,957
and they have different qualities to them.

00:27:24,957 --> 00:27:26,230
So you can actually get good at

00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,820
recognizing types of questions,

00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,897
and then figuring out how you should answer them.

00:27:31,897 --> 00:27:35,064
And he has a wonderful section in the back of the book

00:27:35,064 --> 00:27:37,567
that actually takes each type of question,

00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:39,737
and gives you examples of what they sound like,

00:27:39,737 --> 00:27:42,534
so that you can recognize them.

00:27:42,534 --> 00:27:45,459
No matter what type of question you're talking about,

00:27:45,459 --> 00:27:48,864
confrontational, empathetic, diagnostic,

00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,389
any of those things,

00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:54,452
there actually is a formula for answering questions,

00:27:54,452 --> 00:27:56,384
it's the simplest formula you will ever learn

00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:58,803
in your whole career, guaranteed.

00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:01,065
Here's the formula, it's three parts,

00:28:01,065 --> 00:28:02,815
step one is to pause,

00:28:03,984 --> 00:28:07,357
step two is to answer the question,

00:28:07,357 --> 00:28:10,023
step three is to stop.

00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:14,046
Step three is the hardest step, for any speaker,

00:28:14,046 --> 00:28:15,764
and you know, often what happens,

00:28:15,764 --> 00:28:17,365
and I think everybody has seen this

00:28:17,365 --> 00:28:19,704
in presentations they've gone to,

00:28:19,704 --> 00:28:22,659
you get a question, often the first question,

00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,628
and the speaker is off to the races,

00:28:24,628 --> 00:28:27,785
and talks about, you know, five,

00:28:27,785 --> 00:28:30,372
10 minutes worth of answer,

00:28:30,372 --> 00:28:32,421
when really all the person wanted was

00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:33,736
maybe a yes or a no, right.

00:28:33,736 --> 00:28:35,782
So you have to think about stopping,

00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:39,949
and not making you answer a complete lecture

00:28:39,973 --> 00:28:43,137
on whatever the person has asked.

00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:45,152
This is also a really fantastic formula

00:28:45,152 --> 00:28:47,789
if you're ever in a media interview,

00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:50,006
and certainly if you're testifying before Congress

00:28:50,006 --> 00:28:51,608
or the Legislature, it's really good,

00:28:51,608 --> 00:28:53,295
pause, answer, stop,

00:28:53,295 --> 00:28:55,429
don't go too far with that answer.

00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:57,647
And think about, it's worth practicing,

00:28:57,647 --> 00:29:01,625
because I think it's actually difficult to do in real time.

00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:04,619
Another thing for you to think about problem solving,

00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:07,083
and this is also good if you have questions

00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:10,858
that you're not, where you think someone's

00:29:10,858 --> 00:29:13,685
setting up a confrontation with you.

00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:16,229
Try to remember, is this an actual question,

00:29:16,229 --> 00:29:19,176
should there be a question mark at the end of it?

00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:21,347
Or is it just a statement?

00:29:21,347 --> 00:29:24,146
So, I'm sure none of you has ever

00:29:24,146 --> 00:29:27,346
been to a presentation, I'm joking here,

00:29:27,346 --> 00:29:31,013
where people got up, and in their questions,

00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:35,235
never asked a question, but wanted to show you that

00:29:35,235 --> 00:29:38,346
they know everything about the topic.

00:29:38,346 --> 00:29:40,557
So that, "show what you know"

00:29:40,557 --> 00:29:43,974
questioner, is lurking in every audience.

00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:48,997
And this is group psychology, so I'm not making this up,

00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:51,842
there's at least one person in every group,

00:29:51,842 --> 00:29:53,564
who's going to say,

00:29:53,564 --> 00:29:56,515
"I know something about that, and let me share."

00:29:56,515 --> 00:29:58,567
And it may or may not be germane

00:29:58,567 --> 00:30:01,558
to your topic, as the presenter, right,

00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:03,895
it might be to one side of your point,

00:30:03,895 --> 00:30:07,251
and it might be, have no relation to your point,

00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:08,852
or your presentation.

00:30:08,852 --> 00:30:11,604
And so what do you do with a question like that?

00:30:11,604 --> 00:30:13,778
Most speakers get really annoyed,

00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:16,612
and then they start having a debate with the person

00:30:16,612 --> 00:30:20,105
who is trying to compete with them

00:30:20,105 --> 00:30:22,605
for expertise acknowledgement.

00:30:23,472 --> 00:30:27,117
Better would be, simply to let them have their say,

00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,094
because they're going to have it anyhow,

00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:30,447
and you can't, you really can't tell

00:30:30,447 --> 00:30:33,204
who that person will be, unless you know them.

00:30:33,204 --> 00:30:35,952
And a better way for you to handle it would be,

00:30:35,952 --> 00:30:39,151
to listen to them, and acknowledge and thank them,

00:30:39,151 --> 00:30:42,100
and say, thank you, that's a very useful perspective,

00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,646
next question, (laughs), right.

00:30:44,646 --> 00:30:48,813
So sometimes, if the person's going on quite a bit,

00:30:48,961 --> 00:30:53,128
and they're giving us a small lecture in lieu of a question,

00:30:53,891 --> 00:30:57,339
you can stop them, and use the kind of tactic

00:30:57,339 --> 00:30:59,392
that you hear on talk radio,

00:30:59,392 --> 00:31:00,992
which is when the host says,

00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:04,854
is there a question? Do you have a question?

00:31:04,854 --> 00:31:07,852
Right, so it's a question to ask your questioner,

00:31:07,852 --> 00:31:10,109
to call, you know, in effect, call the question,

00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:11,914
and get them to ask a question.

00:31:11,914 --> 00:31:14,533
And sometimes, they will then have a question,

00:31:14,533 --> 00:31:16,379
and other times, they'll simply say no,

00:31:16,379 --> 00:31:18,511
I just wanted to make that point.

00:31:18,511 --> 00:31:20,525
And you say, well, thank you so much for sharing that,

00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:22,573
next question, right.

00:31:22,573 --> 00:31:24,177
Does anyone have a question,

00:31:24,177 --> 00:31:26,763
to indicate that what you're looking for are questions.

00:31:26,763 --> 00:31:28,978
So when you're moderating a group,

00:31:28,978 --> 00:31:33,145
that's another good tool to have in your back pocket.

00:31:33,698 --> 00:31:35,011
The other thing I'll say,

00:31:35,011 --> 00:31:37,759
and this goes back to people who decide to

00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:41,235
exclude Q & A from their presentations

00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:42,137
for whatever reason,

00:31:42,137 --> 00:31:45,997
often times I work with people who eventually tell me

00:31:45,997 --> 00:31:49,845
that they feel that the questions are like a threat to them,

00:31:49,845 --> 00:31:53,169
or they feel that any question is a threat to them.

00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:55,547
And I think it's so useful if you can avoid

00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:58,675
thinking of questions that way,

00:31:58,675 --> 00:32:01,305
you know, not all questions are a threat.

00:32:01,305 --> 00:32:03,724
Sometimes, you know, let's think about,

00:32:03,724 --> 00:32:05,320
what the reasons are people ask questions,

00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,500
they just don't know.

00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,144
They may have no knowledge in your area,

00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:10,709
and they're going to ask a question

00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:13,584
that really doesn't make a lot of sense.

00:32:13,584 --> 00:32:15,801
They may have a lot of knowledge in your area,

00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:17,935
and they just want to share it, right,

00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:20,150
or they want to disagree with you,

00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,666
and they're entitled to do that.

00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:25,235
You don't have to agree with your questioner,

00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:26,757
you know, so the point of questions is

00:32:26,757 --> 00:32:28,439
not to wrestle the speaker to the ground

00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:31,398
and make you cry for help.

00:32:31,398 --> 00:32:34,480
You know, your questioner is allowed to have an opinion,

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,647
and you're allowed to have your opinion as well.

00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:41,092
The last kind of problem solving I want to talk about,

00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:44,339
is the one that really bedevils speakers,

00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:46,432
I think, the most, and that's,

00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:49,521
getting a question to which the only correct answer is,

00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:51,188
I don't know, right.

00:32:52,309 --> 00:32:54,654
Many, many speakers fear this question,

00:32:54,654 --> 00:32:57,489
even if it's their business not to know

00:32:57,489 --> 00:32:59,957
the answer to that question, they fear that question.

00:32:59,957 --> 00:33:01,842
To be honest, I don't know why "I don't know"

00:33:01,842 --> 00:33:04,009
is such a problem, really.

00:33:05,457 --> 00:33:08,577
Because we can't know everything, right,

00:33:08,577 --> 00:33:10,955
so hopefully we all understand that.

00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:12,392
So I've come up with some ways

00:33:12,392 --> 00:33:14,781
for you to think about saying, I don't know,

00:33:14,781 --> 00:33:16,257
because you're going to have to, at some point,

00:33:16,257 --> 00:33:19,829
say "I don't know" in relation to a question.

00:33:19,829 --> 00:33:23,439
So you want to think about a two-part construction,

00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:27,220
take a novel way, and I'll give you a couple in a minute,

00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,312
a novel way to say "I don't know"

00:33:29,312 --> 00:33:32,552
in a way that's funny, or interesting,

00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,318
or that helps you make a point,

00:33:34,318 --> 00:33:37,225
and bridge it into why you don't know.

00:33:37,225 --> 00:33:39,435
So don't just say, I don't know,

00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:41,526
explain why you don't know,

00:33:41,526 --> 00:33:43,618
because that context may be useful.

00:33:43,618 --> 00:33:47,062
So some of the ways that I like to say "I don't know"

00:33:47,062 --> 00:33:49,729
and I have six or eight of them,

00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,659
my very favorite is, I wish I knew that.

00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:56,675
I wish I knew that, right.

00:33:56,675 --> 00:33:58,811
And it needs to be genuine, right,

00:33:58,811 --> 00:34:01,688
so if someone says, what's the secret to buying

00:34:01,688 --> 00:34:03,534
a winning lottery ticket?

00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:05,524
You know you wish you knew that, don't you,

00:34:05,524 --> 00:34:06,960
right, so say it.

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,836
Or you could say, you could make it more plaintive,

00:34:09,836 --> 00:34:12,707
and say, you know, if only I knew that.

00:34:12,707 --> 00:34:14,553
Or if you want to be funny,

00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,470
and it's a really good idea, right,

00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:21,450
think of some elusive solution in tech,

00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,333
that nobody has come up with yet.

00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:26,949
You can say, "if I knew that, I'd be a billionaire", right.

00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:28,506
And you know, you need to mean it,

00:34:28,506 --> 00:34:30,641
it needs to suit the topic.

00:34:30,641 --> 00:34:32,819
You also can say, who knows?

00:34:32,819 --> 00:34:34,542
You know, I'm not sure anybody

00:34:34,542 --> 00:34:37,737
knows the answer to that question.

00:34:37,737 --> 00:34:40,777
In technology, and science and engineering,

00:34:40,777 --> 00:34:44,804
sometimes it's appropriate for you to use this as a lesson,

00:34:44,804 --> 00:34:45,637
and say, you know,

00:34:45,637 --> 00:34:49,804
that's just one of the many things we don't know about x,

00:34:49,809 --> 00:34:51,246
whatever your topic is.

00:34:51,246 --> 00:34:53,668
And then tell us, what are some of the things we don't know

00:34:53,668 --> 00:34:57,121
about the topic you have, just so that people understand,

00:34:57,121 --> 00:35:00,367
that you're not being a know it all, standing up here.

00:35:00,367 --> 00:35:01,845
You could do a very simple,

00:35:01,845 --> 00:35:05,207
"I don't know, and here's why I don't know."

00:35:05,207 --> 00:35:07,296
Or, "wouldn't it be nice to know that?"

00:35:07,296 --> 00:35:09,356
But I'm not sure we're ever going to know that,

00:35:09,356 --> 00:35:10,952
and explain again, if you're going to say,

00:35:10,952 --> 00:35:13,291
I'm not sure we're ever going to know something,

00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:16,297
be sure you explain why you think that is,

00:35:16,297 --> 00:35:19,173
because not everyone in audience may know.

00:35:19,173 --> 00:35:22,915
And I love to use a solution that Gloria Steinem uses

00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:25,660
when she speaks to audiences,

00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,551
because it's the perfect kind of crowdsourcing

00:35:27,551 --> 00:35:29,521
for speakers to do.

00:35:29,521 --> 00:35:32,846
Instead of being the expert, and answering a question,

00:35:32,846 --> 00:35:35,682
and very often she's getting questions from people

00:35:35,682 --> 00:35:38,473
about very specific personal experiences

00:35:38,473 --> 00:35:40,809
that they've had, she'll say,

00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:43,883
"I don't know, but maybe someone else here does."

00:35:43,883 --> 00:35:46,471
Who has an answer for this?

00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:48,447
And what she has written is that,

00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:52,614
she looks at Q & A as a problem-solving by the group.

00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,645
So it's perfectly fair game for you, as the expert,

00:35:56,645 --> 00:35:58,984
not to be the expert, and to say, "you know,

00:35:58,984 --> 00:36:01,370
we have a lot talented people in this room,

00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,878
I'm curious as to what they would say,

00:36:03,878 --> 00:36:07,040
an answer to this question that she has just posed."

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,166
That's a really graceful way for you to moderate the room,

00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:14,107
it takes the pressure off you as the expert in question,

00:36:14,107 --> 00:36:18,274
and it lets you bring other people into the conversation.

00:36:19,195 --> 00:36:21,990
I think the last problem-solving, again,

00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:25,105
is one where you have to prepare yourself mentally,

00:36:25,105 --> 00:36:26,706
there are an awful lot of people I know

00:36:26,706 --> 00:36:29,450
who are presenting as junior professionals

00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,954
in front of very senior people.

00:36:31,954 --> 00:36:35,698
And they say, "but they all know more than me,

00:36:35,698 --> 00:36:39,021
I can't give this talk, I can't do Q & A,

00:36:39,021 --> 00:36:40,420
because they all know more than me,

00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,185
and they're going to ask me really hard questions,

00:36:42,185 --> 00:36:44,190
I don't know the answers to."

00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,673
And I think, the way to think about it is,

00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:50,957
again, no one has your perspective, right,

00:36:50,957 --> 00:36:53,128
so your perspective is valid.

00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,837
And you don't have, you're not trying to match wits

00:36:55,837 --> 00:36:57,353
with the audience,

00:36:57,353 --> 00:37:00,233
you're trying to share your unique perspective.

00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:02,042
And if someone doesn't have that perspective,

00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:06,209
that's okay, you have to be ready to deal with that.

00:37:06,513 --> 00:37:08,149
So those are, you know, again,

00:37:08,149 --> 00:37:11,141
planning, predicting your questions, and problem solving,

00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:12,987
whether you do it in advance or on the fly.

00:37:12,987 --> 00:37:15,243
That's my formula for Q & A.

00:37:15,243 --> 00:37:18,938
And now, I'd love to hear some questions,

00:37:18,938 --> 00:37:21,438
whether I have answers or not.

00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:25,478
[Michael]- Well thank you very much, Denise.

00:37:25,478 --> 00:37:26,829
First, I'd like to ask the room

00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:30,579
if we have any questions inside the commons.

00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:34,512
Okay, we'll take it to the Etherpad.

00:37:35,498 --> 00:37:38,617
One question you were just addressing, came in,

00:37:38,617 --> 00:37:40,222
"is it good to pass the question to the audience,

00:37:40,222 --> 00:37:42,155
if I do not know the answer?"

00:37:42,155 --> 00:37:43,298
I think you addressed this quite well,

00:37:43,298 --> 00:37:44,268
but building upon that,

00:37:44,268 --> 00:37:46,370
are there any special considerations,

00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,036
if you were to pass the audience back to the question,

00:37:49,036 --> 00:37:51,460
or excuse me, pass the question back to the audience?

00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,387
[Denise]- I think you just have to assume that,

00:37:53,387 --> 00:37:56,383
maybe no one in the audience knows either, right.

00:37:56,383 --> 00:37:58,317
And then it's an opportunity to say, okay,

00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:02,135
so it's clear that all these bright minds

00:38:02,135 --> 00:38:03,739
don't know the answer to this,

00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:07,638
there's a challenge for all of us to address going forward.

00:38:07,638 --> 00:38:09,782
Right, and then, next question, right,

00:38:09,782 --> 00:38:11,877
you can always call for the next question.

00:38:11,877 --> 00:38:15,447
But I think it also is a generous thing

00:38:15,447 --> 00:38:18,276
for a speaker to do, to include the audience,

00:38:18,276 --> 00:38:20,532
because you never know who's sitting in your audience,

00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:22,293
most of the time.

00:38:22,293 --> 00:38:23,364
[Michael]- Great, thank you.

00:38:23,364 --> 00:38:25,134
Another question that we had come in,

00:38:25,134 --> 00:38:28,876
"how do you like to measure audience satisfaction,

00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:32,528
when you're answering a question from an attendee,

00:38:32,528 --> 00:38:35,515
in terms of whether or not it was properly addressed?"

00:38:35,515 --> 00:38:37,080
[Denise] - Right, so sometimes,

00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,541
and I certainly had this experience myself as a speaker,

00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:42,758
you answer the question with the wrong answer,

00:38:42,758 --> 00:38:44,819
and it's not wrong because it's not factual,

00:38:44,819 --> 00:38:47,331
it's not the question they were asking,

00:38:47,331 --> 00:38:49,060
you misunderstood the question, right.

00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,524
So you may answer a question,

00:38:51,524 --> 00:38:52,557
and the person will come back and say,

00:38:52,557 --> 00:38:54,489
"no, what I really meant was this."

00:38:54,489 --> 00:38:57,371
That's an invitation for you to pause,

00:38:57,371 --> 00:38:59,143
and ask some more questions

00:38:59,143 --> 00:39:02,424
before you jump in and answer again, right.

00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:03,703
So that's a signal that, guess what,

00:39:03,703 --> 00:39:06,007
you didn't quite get it right on the first try,

00:39:06,007 --> 00:39:08,629
work with me, the audience member.

00:39:08,629 --> 00:39:11,013
It may be that there is no answer to their question,

00:39:11,013 --> 00:39:13,313
that may be frustrating to them, right.

00:39:13,313 --> 00:39:16,555
It's hard to control for audience satisfaction, right,

00:39:16,555 --> 00:39:18,321
there's no way to do that.

00:39:18,321 --> 00:39:19,710
But I think if you're honest,

00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,437
and you give them a process where they feel

00:39:21,437 --> 00:39:23,126
as if they've been heard,

00:39:23,126 --> 00:39:25,308
your satisfaction and your rating as a speaker

00:39:25,308 --> 00:39:26,627
are going to go up.

00:39:26,627 --> 00:39:28,435
[Michael] - Absolutely.

00:39:28,435 --> 00:39:29,268
Thank you.

00:39:30,361 --> 00:39:31,194
Certainly.

00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:40,872
- Hi.

00:39:40,872 --> 00:39:41,705
- Hi.

00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,298
[Potch]- Something I've always had trouble with

00:39:45,298 --> 00:39:48,382
when giving presentations is,

00:39:48,382 --> 00:39:52,278
gauging whether I spoke over the audience's head,

00:39:52,278 --> 00:39:53,871
or way under their feet,

00:39:53,871 --> 00:39:56,213
making sure that they understood, you know, things.

00:39:56,213 --> 00:39:58,558
Is there a, do you feel,

00:39:58,558 --> 00:40:01,802
or do you know how to let the Q & A,

00:40:01,802 --> 00:40:03,563
like how to almost influence a Q & A session

00:40:03,563 --> 00:40:06,761
to give you an impression of whether you met

00:40:06,761 --> 00:40:09,640
the sort of knowledge of the room,

00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,249
or enhanced the knowledge of the room,

00:40:11,249 --> 00:40:13,428
or if they all glazed over, kind of stuff.

00:40:13,428 --> 00:40:14,705
[Denise] - Right, well you know,

00:40:14,705 --> 00:40:17,416
some of them won't want to tell you, right...

00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:20,574
Among other things, one solution for,

00:40:20,574 --> 00:40:23,207
if you know it's that kind of room in advance,

00:40:23,207 --> 00:40:26,744
I would start with some Q & A, even a little bit,

00:40:26,744 --> 00:40:29,575
even a little bit, because the people who have

00:40:29,575 --> 00:40:33,189
urgent questions will want to get them out early, right.

00:40:33,189 --> 00:40:37,356
So that's where you can find the super expert,

00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,297
and the novice, right.

00:40:39,297 --> 00:40:40,900
And you'll find people who'll put their hand up and say,

00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,825
"well, I don't know as much as he does,

00:40:42,825 --> 00:40:44,053
but I just really want to know

00:40:44,053 --> 00:40:46,553
how you get started doing this, right."

00:40:46,553 --> 00:40:48,239
Then you know you have some novices,

00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:51,602
and then you're going to bifurcate your answers,

00:40:51,602 --> 00:40:54,884
or your presentation points throughout the presentation.

00:40:54,884 --> 00:40:57,467
If you haven't done Q & A in advance,

00:40:57,467 --> 00:41:00,919
and you're really looking for some feedback,

00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:04,006
you might start the Q & A by saying,

00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:07,173
now, I've given this talk in this way,

00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,602
I've been aiming for people who do this,

00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,812
but if you're more junior or more senior,

00:41:13,812 --> 00:41:15,408
and you want to have a more in depth

00:41:15,408 --> 00:41:18,566
or more basic discussion, now's the time,

00:41:18,566 --> 00:41:20,459
let me have your questions, right.

00:41:20,459 --> 00:41:23,219
So don't be afraid to kind of

00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:25,724
be the impresario of the Q & A,

00:41:25,724 --> 00:41:27,946
and say, "I've spoken about this,

00:41:27,946 --> 00:41:30,568
but you may think this, or you may think this,

00:41:30,568 --> 00:41:33,443
I'm happy to take all levels of questions."

00:41:33,443 --> 00:41:36,027
I think that's a really thoughtful thing to do.

00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:36,860
[Potch] Thank you.

00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,453
- Hi.

00:41:41,453 --> 00:41:42,286
- Hi.

00:41:42,286 --> 00:41:46,453
- You have said a few times about starting with questions,

00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:47,804
[Denise] - Mm hmm.

00:41:47,804 --> 00:41:49,107
[Attendee] - In the beginning,

00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:51,439
so when you start with questions,

00:41:51,439 --> 00:41:52,998
and you don't get the participation

00:41:52,998 --> 00:41:56,483
that you were wanting, how do you move from there?

00:41:56,483 --> 00:41:57,506
[Denise]- All you have to do,

00:41:57,506 --> 00:41:59,432
so I use it for very specific,

00:41:59,432 --> 00:42:00,914
I don't do it all the time.

00:42:00,914 --> 00:42:03,859
I use it for very, very specific situations,

00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:06,528
often when I don't know who's in the audience,

00:42:06,528 --> 00:42:08,903
when I know very little about the audience,

00:42:08,903 --> 00:42:11,697
or, if I'm talking about a topic,

00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:13,011
you know, I'm sometimes asked to come

00:42:13,011 --> 00:42:14,777
talk about social media,

00:42:14,777 --> 00:42:16,705
and many times, with a large group,

00:42:16,705 --> 00:42:20,231
it's impossible for the organizers to tell me

00:42:20,231 --> 00:42:22,326
the level of expertise.

00:42:22,326 --> 00:42:23,721
And I find with a topic like that,

00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:24,989
you get a lot of novices,

00:42:24,989 --> 00:42:27,414
and you get a lot of people with a lot of expertise.

00:42:27,414 --> 00:42:29,464
And so it's very difficult to figure out

00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:32,539
how to plan a talk for those two audiences,

00:42:32,539 --> 00:42:34,504
so that's when I would use, open with questions,

00:42:34,504 --> 00:42:35,903
but if you get no questions,

00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:38,492
whether it's at the beginning or at the end,

00:42:38,492 --> 00:42:40,663
you want to wait, right.

00:42:40,663 --> 00:42:42,265
And then you can say, okay, great,

00:42:42,265 --> 00:42:44,111
I'll get started with my presentation,

00:42:44,111 --> 00:42:46,576
and perhaps some more questions will occur to you.

00:42:46,576 --> 00:42:48,299
Let me begin.

00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:51,168
Alright, so you're almost introducing yourself,

00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,474
and letting yourself go into the presentation,

00:42:53,474 --> 00:42:55,239
that's really all you have to do.

00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,005
If there are no questions at the beginning,

00:42:57,005 --> 00:42:59,472
that's not a problem, people will,

00:42:59,472 --> 00:43:02,267
questions will occur to people during you talk,

00:43:02,267 --> 00:43:03,167
I guarantee it.

00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:04,466
You know there are really a couple kinds

00:43:04,466 --> 00:43:05,299
of audience members,

00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:07,957
some come with a list of questions

00:43:07,957 --> 00:43:09,594
that they want to ask right away,

00:43:09,594 --> 00:43:12,351
and some people want to hear what you have to say,

00:43:12,351 --> 00:43:15,187
and then formulate their question, or their reaction,

00:43:15,187 --> 00:43:16,707
to what you want to say.

00:43:16,707 --> 00:43:19,057
- And just very specific, for a question,

00:43:19,057 --> 00:43:21,274
when you want to, you know,

00:43:21,274 --> 00:43:23,569
you want to start your presentation,

00:43:23,569 --> 00:43:27,590
with a question to engage the audience.

00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:29,844
You know, in particular.

00:43:29,844 --> 00:43:31,325
- You mean ask them questions?

00:43:31,325 --> 00:43:32,158
- Yes.

00:43:32,158 --> 00:43:33,217
- Yeah, okay.

00:43:33,217 --> 00:43:36,218
- So and, so is that the same approach,

00:43:36,218 --> 00:43:39,176
to just leave it aside and move to your presentation.

00:43:39,176 --> 00:43:41,758
[Denise] - Yes, it's very common, it's almost too common

00:43:41,758 --> 00:43:45,904
for people to say, let me take a poll, right.

00:43:45,904 --> 00:43:48,822
Let me ask for everybody, for a show of hands.

00:43:48,822 --> 00:43:51,411
But it's okay, audiences are used to that, right,

00:43:51,411 --> 00:43:54,027
so we've conditioned audiences that

00:43:54,027 --> 00:43:58,194
there may be some forms of limited, you know, participation.

00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:02,385
And so it's entirely possible for you to ask first,

00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:05,887
ask for some questions, ask some questions of the audience,

00:44:05,887 --> 00:44:08,396
if no one responds, you can make a joke.

00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:10,908
You know, have a joke ready, to say,

00:44:10,908 --> 00:44:13,462
obviously, you're all hiding your opinions from me,

00:44:13,462 --> 00:44:16,911
and that's okay, let me begin my talk, right.

00:44:16,911 --> 00:44:18,348
So as long as you're comfortable with it,

00:44:18,348 --> 00:44:20,599
we'll be comfortable with it, right,

00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:23,564
even if it seems like it should be awkward,

00:44:23,564 --> 00:44:25,616
you get to be the gracious host, and say,

00:44:25,616 --> 00:44:29,533
great, no questions, let me go ahead and start.

00:44:32,398 --> 00:44:34,454
[Havi]- I've got one from the Etherpad,

00:44:34,454 --> 00:44:37,574
so Srushtika would like know

00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:39,629
how to deal with questioners whose

00:44:39,629 --> 00:44:43,082
sole purpose is to criticize the technology

00:44:43,082 --> 00:44:45,582
that you are presenting about?

00:44:46,775 --> 00:44:50,259
So what if the questioner does not

00:44:50,259 --> 00:44:53,872
want to buy the answer that you can provide?

00:44:53,872 --> 00:44:57,161
Even it it's correct, and makes sense?

00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:58,968
[Denise] - Right, that's okay, right,

00:44:58,968 --> 00:45:00,653
they're entitled to their opinion,

00:45:00,653 --> 00:45:02,500
you know, you don't have to--

00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,778
Q & A is not something you can win, right.

00:45:05,778 --> 00:45:07,416
It's not a competition,

00:45:07,416 --> 00:45:10,868
even if your questioner is treating it like a competition,

00:45:10,868 --> 00:45:13,088
you don't have to play, right.

00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:16,138
So it's entirely possible for you to answer

00:45:16,138 --> 00:45:17,991
the question and if they say,

00:45:17,991 --> 00:45:19,346
I still don't like your product,

00:45:19,346 --> 00:45:20,825
say, thank you so much for your feedback,

00:45:20,825 --> 00:45:22,712
next question, right.

00:45:22,712 --> 00:45:23,901
Move on to another question,

00:45:23,901 --> 00:45:25,009
you don't have to continue

00:45:25,009 --> 00:45:27,888
to wrestle with that person, right.

00:45:27,888 --> 00:45:29,369
And frankly, the rest of your audience

00:45:29,369 --> 00:45:30,811
will thank you if you don't.

00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,903
So, you know, don't,

00:45:32,903 --> 00:45:36,351
I see a lot of speakers who somehow think,

00:45:36,351 --> 00:45:39,308
oh, I have to amend my position,

00:45:39,308 --> 00:45:41,775
or I have to change what I'm saying,

00:45:41,775 --> 00:45:43,827
because they're upset with me,

00:45:43,827 --> 00:45:45,306
but no, you don't, right,

00:45:45,306 --> 00:45:46,973
and often you can't.

00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:51,096
[Havi]- So another one from the Etherpad,

00:45:51,096 --> 00:45:53,564
this one's from Gloria, who asks,

00:45:53,564 --> 00:45:56,273
what do we do if we pass on a question to the audience,

00:45:56,273 --> 00:45:58,280
and someone gives an answer that is incorrect,

00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,949
or based in a misconception?

00:46:00,949 --> 00:46:03,532
[Denise]- That happens to me all the time,

00:46:03,532 --> 00:46:05,173
I just want you to know.

00:46:05,173 --> 00:46:06,937
Because there is a lot of mythology

00:46:06,937 --> 00:46:09,966
about what's good to do as a public speaker,

00:46:09,966 --> 00:46:12,963
and so, one of the things that's useful to do,

00:46:12,963 --> 00:46:15,059
that I myself don't always do,

00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:19,226
is try not to let your face give away what you're thinking,

00:46:19,737 --> 00:46:20,883
right, during that time,

00:46:20,883 --> 00:46:23,590
and the best way to do that is to smile, right.

00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,714
A smile is great, it's very neutral, it's very neutral,

00:46:26,714 --> 00:46:28,522
you're listening, you're listening,

00:46:28,522 --> 00:46:31,678
and then you say something like this,

00:46:31,678 --> 00:46:34,184
thank you so much Fred, for sharing your perspective,

00:46:34,184 --> 00:46:37,258
I have to disagree, in my experience,

00:46:37,258 --> 00:46:40,260
speakers should do this, da, da, da, da, da, da.

00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,815
Next question, right.

00:46:41,815 --> 00:46:43,614
So don't be afraid to move it on.

00:46:43,614 --> 00:46:45,215
Don't be afraid to disagree,

00:46:45,215 --> 00:46:49,382
this is a, it's not consensus that you're trying to build,

00:46:49,412 --> 00:46:51,709
it's conversation you're trying to have.

00:46:51,709 --> 00:46:55,876
So Fred, whoever Fred is, can have his perspective,

00:46:56,793 --> 00:46:58,431
and you can have yours, and by the way,

00:46:58,431 --> 00:47:00,233
you have the microphone, right.

00:47:00,233 --> 00:47:02,150
So, take it from there.

00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,390
[Michael]- Daniele asks,

00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:09,563
"what do you think of incorporating

00:47:09,563 --> 00:47:13,069
an asking questions slide at the end of your presentation,

00:47:13,069 --> 00:47:14,736
with a few examples?"

00:47:16,426 --> 00:47:18,093
So I'm not a fan of,

00:47:20,158 --> 00:47:23,068
slides that say things like questions,

00:47:23,068 --> 00:47:25,897
or here are questions, or it's time for questions,

00:47:25,897 --> 00:47:27,005
or anything like that.

00:47:27,005 --> 00:47:28,891
I think it's fine just for you to say,

00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:30,619
and now I'm ready to take your questions.

00:47:30,619 --> 00:47:34,140
I don't know that any audience would use

00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:37,092
questions that were suggested by the speaker,

00:47:37,092 --> 00:47:39,757
I'm not sure I would either, right.

00:47:39,757 --> 00:47:43,077
People really want to be able to ask their own questions,

00:47:43,077 --> 00:47:44,759
whatever those may be.

00:47:44,759 --> 00:47:48,254
So I'm not sure that, that would be as successful.

00:47:48,254 --> 00:47:51,205
Sometimes speakers have actually said to me,

00:47:51,205 --> 00:47:54,037
I know what I'll do, I'll plant three friends of mine

00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,583
in the audience and get them to ask really

00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:58,508
thoughtful questions that I want to answer.

00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:00,604
And here's the problem with that,

00:48:00,604 --> 00:48:02,984
we can tell, right.

00:48:02,984 --> 00:48:06,930
So try not to fake it, right, try not to fake it.

00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:11,097
It's much more electric and interesting, and connecting,

00:48:11,161 --> 00:48:15,328
to let people ask the real questions that they have.

00:48:16,867 --> 00:48:19,867
[Michael]- Great advice, thank you very much.

00:48:21,914 --> 00:48:25,831
Do we have any other questions inside the room?

00:48:29,292 --> 00:48:31,762
[Havi]- I've got one. One more from the Etherpad,

00:48:31,762 --> 00:48:34,094
from Manel, and she wants to know,

00:48:34,094 --> 00:48:37,173
this is a little bit like a nuance of an earlier question,

00:48:37,173 --> 00:48:39,100
but let's go for it.

00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:43,158
How to you know if you answered well to a question,

00:48:43,158 --> 00:48:44,468
when you feel like the person

00:48:44,468 --> 00:48:46,891
isn't satisfied with your answer?

00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:48,653
Where to take it from there?

00:48:48,653 --> 00:48:50,872
[Denise]- So you mean they're kind of fidgeting,

00:48:50,872 --> 00:48:53,461
or looking at you funny, or they're giving you

00:48:53,461 --> 00:48:57,287
some kind of physical cue that they're not happy,

00:48:57,287 --> 00:48:59,635
as opposed to just arguing with you?

00:48:59,635 --> 00:49:01,151
[Havi]- Sounds good.

00:49:01,151 --> 00:49:01,984
- Yeah, okay.

00:49:01,984 --> 00:49:02,817
[Denise] - Okay.

00:49:02,817 --> 00:49:05,734
- So, if you sense some discomfort,

00:49:06,696 --> 00:49:09,449
be aware that your perception of what's happening

00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:12,764
in the mind of that person may just be your perception.

00:49:12,764 --> 00:49:13,954
Right, so again, I would say,

00:49:13,954 --> 00:49:17,033
never assume that you know what people are thinking,

00:49:17,033 --> 00:49:19,162
until they tell you, right.

00:49:19,162 --> 00:49:20,638
That would be step one.

00:49:20,638 --> 00:49:24,579
So you could say, does that answer your question?

00:49:24,579 --> 00:49:26,549
That's a nice, neutral thing to say.

00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:29,542
You finish answering, right, pause, answer, stop,

00:49:29,542 --> 00:49:32,215
and then say, did that answer your question?

00:49:32,215 --> 00:49:35,165
And they will say, "actually, no it didn't,

00:49:35,165 --> 00:49:38,284
I really wish you'd talk about such and so, right.

00:49:38,284 --> 00:49:42,179
Or I disagree completely with your approach to x."

00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:45,055
And say, "thank you, that's really useful feedback for me.

00:49:45,055 --> 00:49:48,505
You know, that's my opinion, and I'm sticking with it,

00:49:48,505 --> 00:49:51,010
and it's good to know that you disagree.

00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:52,650
Next question, right."

00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:56,754
So you can acknowledge, without agreeing,

00:49:56,754 --> 00:50:00,575
and you can thank people for contributing to the discussion,

00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,719
you're not thanking them

00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:03,153
because you agree with their opinion,

00:50:03,153 --> 00:50:05,491
you're just thanking them for participating.

00:50:05,491 --> 00:50:07,333
And what are doing when you do that?

00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:09,425
You're giving a signal to the rest of the audience

00:50:09,425 --> 00:50:12,822
that it's okay to ask a contrary question,

00:50:12,822 --> 00:50:13,655
and that you're going to

00:50:13,655 --> 00:50:16,110
handle them politely and professionally,

00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:20,277
as opposed to getting in a fist fight with them, right.

00:50:21,161 --> 00:50:22,718
[Michael]- Could you give us a couple of quick examples

00:50:22,718 --> 00:50:26,738
of how to interject to regain control of a conversation?

00:50:26,738 --> 00:50:29,610
If somebody is perhaps speaking a little too long?

00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,932
[Denise]- So every speaker and every moderator,

00:50:32,932 --> 00:50:35,438
I also write a blog about moderating panels,

00:50:35,438 --> 00:50:37,363
at ModeratingPanels.com,

00:50:37,363 --> 00:50:41,530
and that's the, you know, the devil in the details

00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,500
for the panel moderator, among others,

00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,667
is the longwinded off-topic question that doesn't end.

00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,885
Or it seems like it, right.

00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:54,307
And so again, I refer you to,

00:50:54,307 --> 00:50:55,624
I think it's a wonderful practice

00:50:55,624 --> 00:50:57,921
for people who are handling questions,

00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:01,861
to listen to journalists who are good at asking questions,

00:51:01,861 --> 00:51:04,403
and listen to moderators,

00:51:04,403 --> 00:51:06,824
so you might watch Meet the Press, or Face the Nation,

00:51:06,824 --> 00:51:08,879
where they're moderating a panel of journalists,

00:51:08,879 --> 00:51:10,480
sometimes, to see how they do it.

00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,688
Or, if you prefer, talk radio,

00:51:12,688 --> 00:51:16,127
because talk radio hosts have been doing this for decades.

00:51:16,127 --> 00:51:19,985
And so on talk radio, you'll often hear a radio host say,

00:51:19,985 --> 00:51:23,844
"do you have a question, in the middle of a long answer,

00:51:23,844 --> 00:51:27,214
that's really kind of a sermon on the topic.

00:51:27,214 --> 00:51:28,610
Is there a question?

00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:30,009
Do you have a question?"

00:51:30,009 --> 00:51:32,101
To get them to formulate a question.

00:51:32,101 --> 00:51:34,273
If they're just making a long observation,

00:51:34,273 --> 00:51:36,612
you can say, "thank you so much for sharing that,

00:51:36,612 --> 00:51:38,784
I want to make sure we have time for other people,

00:51:38,784 --> 00:51:40,546
who have questions," right,

00:51:40,546 --> 00:51:43,010
so that other people will ask questions, right.

00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:44,365
So you can suggest to the audience,

00:51:44,365 --> 00:51:46,662
what you would like them to do.

00:51:46,662 --> 00:51:49,937
On BBC Woman's Hour, which is a podcast I listen to a lot,

00:51:49,937 --> 00:51:52,069
it's a great, great show,

00:51:52,069 --> 00:51:53,506
one of the hosts, Jane Garvey,

00:51:53,506 --> 00:51:57,280
was just interviewing a politician, a member of Parliament,

00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,153
who, I think, thought her question was

00:52:00,153 --> 00:52:03,236
an invitation to give a speech,

00:52:03,236 --> 00:52:05,286
like a really long one.

00:52:05,286 --> 00:52:09,151
And so, she sort of let him go on for a bit,

00:52:09,151 --> 00:52:12,635
and she then politely jumped in,

00:52:12,635 --> 00:52:15,222
because she knew his name, she said his name, she said,

00:52:15,222 --> 00:52:17,234
you know, "Mr. Jones," and he said,

00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:19,285
"well, I'm not finished."

00:52:19,285 --> 00:52:21,211
And she said, "won't you then?"

00:52:21,211 --> 00:52:22,044
(laughs)

00:52:22,044 --> 00:52:22,877
(laughter)

00:52:22,877 --> 00:52:26,464
[Denise] Right, so that's a clever way to get it in there,

00:52:26,464 --> 00:52:28,520
you know, the thing is that,

00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,490
the rest of the audience, keep in mind that,

00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:31,719
the rest of the audience,

00:52:31,719 --> 00:52:35,359
who is not giving you that long-winded question,

00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,825
also would like this person to wrap it up,

00:52:37,825 --> 00:52:39,709
so they have a chance to ask.

00:52:39,709 --> 00:52:41,551
So keep in mind the entire room

00:52:41,551 --> 00:52:44,381
when you're handling people like this, right.

00:52:44,381 --> 00:52:47,381
And you can say, "can you wrap it up,

00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:50,366
can you get to the questions?,

00:52:50,366 --> 00:52:52,170
because I know we have a lot of people waiting,"

00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:53,686
and you look at the room,

00:52:53,686 --> 00:52:56,595
and you'll see a lot of people doing this, right,

00:52:56,595 --> 00:52:58,178
in acknowledgement.

00:52:59,261 --> 00:53:01,312
[Michael] - It looks like we have one final question,

00:53:01,312 --> 00:53:03,814
coming in from IRC, Alex asks,

00:53:03,814 --> 00:53:05,500
what's your favorite first question

00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,989
for when you open with a five minute Q & A session?

00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:12,481
[Denise]- What's my favorite first question?

00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:14,453
Well it really depends on the topic,

00:53:14,453 --> 00:53:18,114
but I actually love getting someone

00:53:18,114 --> 00:53:21,896
who asks a question that I can answer quickly,

00:53:21,896 --> 00:53:23,542
in that situation.

00:53:23,542 --> 00:53:26,008
Because people do come with different kinds of things,

00:53:26,008 --> 00:53:28,188
there is the long-winded question, of course,

00:53:28,188 --> 00:53:30,443
but some people really just have a quick,

00:53:30,443 --> 00:53:34,555
short question, they just want a quick, short answer to.

00:53:34,555 --> 00:53:37,060
It's a wonderful way to kick that off,

00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:37,893
it's harder, I think,

00:53:37,893 --> 00:53:40,587
if you start with a question that's really complicated,

00:53:40,587 --> 00:53:42,312
that you can't answer in real time,

00:53:42,312 --> 00:53:43,666
and you have to put the person off.

00:53:43,666 --> 00:53:46,216
But you can, in that situation,

00:53:46,216 --> 00:53:49,003
say, I'm going to, that's such a good question,

00:53:49,003 --> 00:53:50,519
I need to leave that until later,

00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:52,777
because it's a big part of my presentation, right.

00:53:52,777 --> 00:53:54,610
So, and then go to it.

00:53:57,542 --> 00:53:59,592
[Michael]- Well, it looks like that's all of our questions for today,

00:53:59,592 --> 00:54:01,073
Denise, I thank you very much for making time

00:54:01,073 --> 00:54:03,574
to come and speak with us here at Mountain View.

00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:04,519
[Denise]- My pleasure.

00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:05,352
- Absolutely.

00:54:05,352 --> 00:54:06,533
- Thanks everyone.

00:54:06,533 --> 00:54:08,783
(applause)

00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:33,891
