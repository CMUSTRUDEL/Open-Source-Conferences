- Hello everyone.

00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,950
Welcome to our second tech briefing with Josh.

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,734
Today's the 12th July, 2018,

00:00:16,734 --> 00:00:21,734
and Josh is here to present about Mixed Reality update.

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,850
So as you know, Josh is a coder, author, and

00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,810
and all around client-side wonk,

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,450
and also, he's an advocate on Mozilla evangelizing

00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,950
for VR now, and most of his work

00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,120
is focusing on Mixed Reality.

00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,700
We are looking for your questions.

00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,690
Please write them in the Etherpad.

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,710
We share everything on Telegram channel.

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,710
If you have any questions, you can write to me or Havi,

00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,760
and Josh, whenever you are ready, you can start.

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,580
- Okay, thank you.

00:01:03,844 --> 00:01:05,190
Thank you for that introduction.

00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,880
Yeah I'm excited to be here.

00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,290
I'll see if my screen share is working here.

00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,580
Hopefully you can all see my web browser now.

00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,970
Hopefully you should see my presentation here.

00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,960
There we go, okay.

00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:32,280
I'm gonna start with kind of a summary

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,190
of what I did last time and then talk about

00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,846
everything that's new, because Mixed Reality

00:01:37,846 --> 00:01:40,513
and especially Mixed Reality on the web

00:01:40,513 --> 00:01:44,040
is a vary rapidly changing field.

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,854
So things just, it's totally different than it was

00:01:46,854 --> 00:01:50,070
even six months ago.

00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,590
So I'll skip, you know what Mozilla is.

00:01:54,736 --> 00:01:56,880
I'll talk a little bit about the Emerging Tech Group.

00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,700
So this is kind of a research group at Mozilla

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,260
and all of the Mixed Reality work we've been doing is

00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,550
part of that Emerging Technology Group.

00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:09,660
In addition to Mixed Reality, we also have researchers

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,610
working on speech recognition, deep learning,

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,250
Project Things, which is a Web of Things toolkit,

00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,910
and of course Developer Relations is part of

00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,010
Emerging Tech as well.

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,850
My name is Josh.

00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,340
I'm a senior developer advocate.

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,980
And my job is really to educate outside developers

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,240
and what I would call proto-developers,

00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,950
meaning people who might not consider themselves developers

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,310
but they still are creators of things.

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,950
Even if they're not creating with code,

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,090
they're still creating.

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,230
They might be artists.

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,180
They might just be, they might be hobbyists,

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,370
they might be students taking a class.

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,370
People want to learn and build things,

00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,730
so my job is to help educate

00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,055
and I do that through blogs, through videos,

00:02:57,055 --> 00:02:59,200
like these slide streams.

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,840
I should mention I just recently started experimenting

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,230
with Twitch, doing some livestreaming there on Twitch.

00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,990
Twitch is interesting.

00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,017
It's different than doing like a pre-recorded YouTube thing

00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:16,010
but yeah it's interesting.

00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,080
We'll see how it goes.

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,945
I of course also create a lot of demos and presentations

00:03:21,945 --> 00:03:24,680
like some of the stuff you're seeing right now.

00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,680
On the other hand also my job is to bring feedback

00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,950
from outside developers back into the company.

00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,640
So that we need this feedback,

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,550
so that we can improve our products

00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,079
that we can chart new directions, which means like,

00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:48,230
are we making the right thing.

00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,220
Maybe there's a totally underserved market

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,640
that we should be looking at,

00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,710
and it's both from a presentation

00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:01,130
and a software point of view and education and everything.

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,050
So our goal is to learn how we can make you successful.

00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,690
So with that in mind, number one thing to remember

00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,120
my email is me@josh.earth.

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,890
You can send it to my Mozilla email

00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,900
but it's longer and harder to spell,

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,100
so we'll get that real short one.

00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,340
What is Mixed Reality, which is the focus of my work?

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,640
We think of Mixed Reality as really a spectrum

00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,430
between the real environment through augmented reality

00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,407
to augmented virtual reality

00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,080
all the way to a pure virtual environment.

00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,980
So what does that actually mean?

00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,549
Augmented reality is when you are overlaying graphics

00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:44,400
or other information on top of the real world.

00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,948
It should be ideally anchored to the real world.

00:04:48,948 --> 00:04:50,960
And obviously if you're seeing the real world,

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,200
then it's not immersive.

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,400
There are lot of examples and things

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,430
which are kind of partial AR.

00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,680
Like the recent Google Glass, it wasn't anchored

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,220
to the world, but it did display information

00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,291
here in your glasses.

00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,860
The middle image here is a headsup display (HUD),

00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,900
which has mostly just a HUD overlaying,

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,950
but it does have a few things which are based

00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,260
on reality, like the compass directions.

00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,740
And then of course on the right here is

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,380
Pokemon Go, which is probably the most popular

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,250
AR application, which originally did not use,

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,480
it sort of overlayed on the real world because it knew about geolocations

00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,880
and would represent graphics around those locations.

00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,610
Now it is starting to use more of the camera

00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,790
to capture the physical environment.

00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,640
So that's at the AR side of Mixed Reality.

00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,160
The VR side is where you're completely immersive,

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,450
there's a wide field of view,

00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,520
a very fast refresh rate, fast sensor rate.

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,160
And there's a whole bunch of headsets

00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,047
which fit this and I'll get into those in a second.

00:05:58,047 --> 00:06:00,000
Our goal of course is that,

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,260
eventually AR will be just something built into your

00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,529
sunglasses, which seems really futuristic,

00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:10,065
but Magic Leap is shipping something this year

00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:11,490
that will do this.

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,574
Intel showed off some prototype glasses.

00:06:15,574 --> 00:06:18,500
And then on the VR side, the idea would be

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,589
like the holodeck,

00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:24,610
but we are actually getting a lot closer than you think.

00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:28,000
There are professional VR studios where people

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,420
have whole setups where multiple people can interact

00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,620
in the same physical space and the same virtual space

00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,020
at the same time.

00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,230
And this photo is from a year ago,

00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:42,010
the new HTC Vive Pro that's either coming out

00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,391
or has just come out.

00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:45,400
We'll make this even better.

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,400
You can have people wandering in VR through multiple

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,000
physical rooms all as part of one shared space.

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,890
So very, very cool.

00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,510
Alright, why is this all happening now?

00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:03,160
Well VR and AR and MR whatever we wanna call it,

00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,590
we are kind of calling it XR,

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,040
just to encompass everything.

00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:10,650
It actually has a very long history.

00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,440
People have been working on this since almost

00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,510
the dawn of computing.

00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:18,170
The Sword of Damocles project was created in 1968.

00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,200
In the 80s, VPL created the data glove and the data suit

00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,070
here and this thing on his head was actually called

00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,810
and Eye Phone with e-y-e.

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,330
In the 90s, there were 3D video games you could play,

00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,270
but the graphics were pretty limited.

00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,180
This was like high-end arcade stuff

00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,720
and it was still pretty limited.

00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,180
The reason it's happening now is because

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,110
of the smartphone revolution.

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,910
Now you can buy a phone for 500 bucks with dual cameras.

00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,270
Some have depth sensing cameras.

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,550
We are getting machine learning in the hardware.

00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,742
Mobile, very powerful GPUs and CPUs.

00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:57,240
So really we are just waiting for the technology

00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,590
to catch up.

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,400
Now these numbers are from last fall.

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,233
This has changed.

00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:07,130
The HTC Vive has gotten cheaper

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:11,060
and the Vive Pro is announced and I think shipping.

00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,545
The Oculus Rift has gotten cheaper

00:08:13,545 --> 00:08:17,420
and they have been teasing their next generation one.

00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,280
You can get a PlayStation VR, Windows partnered

00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,720
with a bunch of manufacturers to create what's called

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,760
Windows Mixed Reality.

00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,920
Despite the term mixed,

00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,790
Windows Mixed Reality is really VR.

00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,623
It's immersive.

00:08:32,623 --> 00:08:33,820
It does have cameras on it,

00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,220
but the cameras are for tracking.

00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,610
Now what's interesting is that

00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:43,470
these things required these big gigantic things called

00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,150
beacons which are gonna be you have to like

00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,276
anchor them up, super high

00:08:48,276 --> 00:08:50,810
in your room to kind of bathe the room

00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,990
in infrared so that the headset can figure out where it is.

00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,230
Well with the MR sets, they use what's called

00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,200
inside out tracking.

00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,250
So you don't need to have all the stuff in the room.

00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,660
You just put the headset on

00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,750
and through optical algorithms,

00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,486
it can figure out where it is.

00:09:05,486 --> 00:09:07,700
That also means that the systems are cheaper

00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,290
because they're offloading more to processing

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,090
but you can do that with a computer.

00:09:13,695 --> 00:09:17,110
They range from like 200 to 500 dollars.

00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,060
Since I got one of these,

00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,560
I have stopped using the ones that require

00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,729
the beacons because they were just a pain.

00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,220
Now the medium end, there is Google Daydream and

00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,690
Gear VR, which are essentially you put a phone into

00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,890
a special device and it's got a wireless controller

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,050
and now you have a VR headset,

00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,730
or all the way down to Google Cardboard

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,690
which is where you stick a phone in that thing,

00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,580
there is no input, just gaze,

00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,480
but it's entry level VR essentially for free

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,880
if you already have a phone.

00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,990
On the AR side, there is the Hololens,

00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,140
there is still about 4000 dollars,

00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,020
but the Meta 2 has come out.

00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,000
It's about $1500

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,190
and the price is gonna keep dropping.

00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,890
Again there is the kind of standalone phone version

00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,920
where if you already have a phone,

00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,697
you can do a lot of augmented reality stuff

00:10:08,697 --> 00:10:10,790
surely in software.

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,654
So Apple released the AR kit APIs

00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,020
which are continuing to improve.

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,400
Android has AR Core

00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,840
and the newest iPhone has a depth-sensing camera.

00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,680
So that's all the stuff that's shipped now.

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,812
Things keep getting cheaper and cheaper.

00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:34,560
And the Vive that people made, the HTC Vive

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,240
have this thing called the Vive Focus

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,240
which is, runs Android and has a more limited

00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,238
app selection than their desktop one,

00:10:44,238 --> 00:10:47,740
but it's completely self contained.

00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,790
You don't need a laptop.

00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,280
You don't need a phone.

00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,953
And this thing runs on, I want to say like 400ish dollars.

00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,950
And it's six degrees of freedom tracking.

00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:00,310
So it can detect when you move this way,

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,840
when you move forward and back as well as all the topping.

00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,560
For 400 bucks that's really impressive.

00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,560
Then there's the Oculus Go, which just shipped in May

00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,100
and the Oculus Go is only three degrees of tracking,

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,530
meaning it can detect when you move your head

00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,760
and tilt and the same with the controller,

00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,220
but it can't detect if you move forward or back.

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,920
However, it's self-contained and it's only $200.

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,710
It runs essentially Oculus's own version of Android

00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,410
and it has got it's own app store.

00:11:33,645 --> 00:11:37,080
You load all of the things to the app store via Wi-Fi.

00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,828
And these devices I think are really game changers

00:11:39,828 --> 00:11:42,660
for VR because not only are they cheaper,

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,545
but they remove so many of the barriers of getting in VR.

00:11:47,545 --> 00:11:50,820
You just sit down, you put it on your head

00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,800
and you are in VR.

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,060
You don't have to get your phone out of your pocket

00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,440
and set it up and this thing and then launch a

00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,273
special app.

00:11:57,273 --> 00:12:00,214
You don't have to install a whole bunch of software

00:12:00,214 --> 00:12:02,700
in your expensive gaming PC.

00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,250
You just put it on your head and you're good to go.

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,420
It's really wonderful.

00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,280
The price continues to go down and the quality

00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,300
continues to go up.

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,779
I expect the Oculus Go, probably to have a refresh

00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:19,530
by Christmas, even if not, this is like this Christmas.

00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,240
This is gonna be the thing that everyone is gonna buy.

00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,460
It's really exciting.

00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,840
Now in terms of potential users,

00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,900
a lot of people say VR is just for games and movies.

00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,010
It's true, a lot of people do use VR

00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:38,780
especially things like the Oculus Go for games and movies.

00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,400
You can play a lot of fun games, you can watch 2D movies,

00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:46,070
feel like you're in surround sound with a bit screen TV.

00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,091
You can watch 360 movies, VR movies.

00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:50,870
It is really good for that,

00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,000
but there is a lot more than just games and movies.

00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,240
There is a complete Mars simulation,

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,510
where you can simulate what it would be like to

00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,440
land on Mars with current technology.

00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:08,330
There is an amazing 360 video, it's like a 20 minute movie

00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,540
created of the White House called the People's House.

00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,250
It feels like you are in the White House

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,420
talking to the President.

00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,990
It feels like you get to go to the Situation Room.

00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,810
People are doing really amazing things.

00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,380
On the AR side for the Olympics,

00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,900
the New York Times created a special Olympics app,

00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,490
which had a lot of AR stuff in it.

00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,920
That worked really amazing,

00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,493
like I could basically drop one of the figure skaters

00:13:39,493 --> 00:13:42,760
into my house, and in fact you see here

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,360
the top of the stairs in my house,

00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,727
and you can walk around and look at how they jump

00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:50,650
and where the motion is and all those amazing quads.

00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,940
SnapChat has lenses, both Front lens and World lenses now,

00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,783
so you can create these AR environments out there.

00:14:00,783 --> 00:14:04,270
And there is a lot of really cool 360 videos.

00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,390
It's pretty easy to build these days.

00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,460
Here I'm gonna show you a little clip.

00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,610
This is from YouTube.

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,910
This is some astronauts.

00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,310
Come on, you can do it.

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,090
Alright, we may have to skip the video.

00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,518
Alright here we go.

00:14:26,518 --> 00:14:29,410
(video playing)

00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:34,410
Now it's on 3D because I'm not, wait no, it does do it right.

00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,200
So this is cosmonauts

00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,330
who are about to launch.

00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,860
They're gonna launch satellites by hand.

00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,123
So you can just look around.

00:14:59,371 --> 00:15:01,753
See everything they're doing.

00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,950
I think this is where he launches the,

00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,800
there we go.

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
He just threw out a satellite by hand.

00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,630
That is just crazy to me.

00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,600
So there's all sorts of amazing stuff.

00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,800
I think we are just tapping the surface of

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,580
what can be done with VR and AR.

00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,998
You can imagine like exhibits and museums where

00:15:29,998 --> 00:15:32,750
you would scan the poster and it would anchor

00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,930
some animated 3D graphics around the thing

00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,030
you're looking at anchored by the position of poster.

00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,963
You can get more information about the painters

00:15:40,963 --> 00:15:43,615
in art museum, not just little bits of text

00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,560
but whole video.

00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,320
I really wanna see a walking tour of Pompeii.

00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,997
I went to Pompeii about 10 years ago.

00:15:51,997 --> 00:15:53,938
And if you don't know Pompeii,

00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:58,180
it's an ancient Roman city that was destroyed by volcano

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,940
and they've slowly been excavating it.

00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:06,650
And they sold these little books with translucent overlays

00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,400
so you could see here's a photo of what it looks today

00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,244
and then the overlay which showed you what it looked like

00:16:11,244 --> 00:16:13,340
2000 years ago.

00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,160
Well we could do that now with AR,

00:16:16,503 --> 00:16:18,420
so you could actually be walking through the rooms

00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,200
of Pompeii and have real architectural diagrams,

00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,680
animations of people walking around their daily life,

00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,020
really see what it was like in Pompeii.

00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,420
Just so many amazing things.

00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,160
Now the challenge is that

00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,580
hardware is getting better and better,

00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,840
but softwares are a little bit lagging.

00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,700
There's mostly games and 360 videos,

00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,410
you need lot of specialized skills to

00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,500
create this sort of content.

00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,450
We of course suggest you do everything in the web first,

00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,350
because the web is everywhere,

00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:58,595
and the 3D support on web has gotten pretty good.

00:16:58,595 --> 00:17:01,700
WebGL it's hardware accelerated in most places,

00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,650
even on mobile.

00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,970
Web VR 1.0 gives you access to the controllers

00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,622
and the headset poses.

00:17:09,622 --> 00:17:14,622
And we are part of a working group with Google and Apple

00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:18,160
and Microsoft, to develop common specs for the

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,460
next generation of this which is called WebXR.

00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,793
And we have even created a prototype experimental browser

00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:28,680
called the XRViewer, which you can get in

00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,477
the iOS app store,

00:17:30,477 --> 00:17:33,510
which lets you run these demos.

00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:38,510
Here is one where I actually was building giant blocks

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,440
LEGO blocks in my living room.

00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,442
There you go.

00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:49,560
So actually here's a solar system in my living room.

00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,360
I did this last Christmas obviously.

00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,870
Here is the block saying I just have to keep adding

00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:00,130
more blocks and create this virtual giant LEGO structure

00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,030
in my living room.

00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,430
So super fun.

00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,060
So you can start experimenting with the stuff today.

00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,460
It is called the WebXR viewer.

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,900
It's in the iOS app store.

00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,100
Google has a similar one in the Android app store.

00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,880
Their version of WebXR is slightly different than ours

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,870
We're in the process of reconciling the two APIs.

00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,770
So that's coming along well.

00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,850
We also want to make building content easier.

00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,850
So A-Frame is the goto place for

00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,940
building simple 3D VR scenes.

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,670
And I'm pretty sure I've talked to you guys

00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,570
about this before.

00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:44,160
It has components for 3D objects, particles, physics,

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,870
importing 3D models, really good stuff.

00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,710
Now what's changed since I made this slide deck is

00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:55,490
I've been working on a few workshops

00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,590
and I discovered this thing called Glitch.

00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,290
So Glitch is really awesome.

00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,430
With Glitch, you can create your own projects.

00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,520
Here's one I created for a recent workshop I did

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,700
at my local library.

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,360
So I'm gonna edit the project and you can see

00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,010
that on the side, here's my notes.

00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:18,843
Here's my code.

00:19:18,843 --> 00:19:20,693
I have an inline code editor

00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:23,560
and I can just hit show live.

00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,270
Then it will show my creation

00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,686
and I can go back and immediately do like: "let's change

00:19:29,686 --> 00:19:33,230
that green thing on my forehead to be blue.

00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,050
Let's see, and then, oh that was the green.

00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,590
Then we'll change that one also.

00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,020
We'll change that one to be red.

00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,200
And now it's immediately updated.

00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:51,550
So Glitch is really amazing combined with A-Frame,

00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:55,030
because not only can I do all of this stuff in a web-based

00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,210
system but I can send this link to somebody else.

00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,420
They can view it and then they can hit this little

00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:04,730
button here and remix it and create our own copy,

00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,190
which means I can now create on my workshop content here

00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,780
as Glitches, and the students can just start

00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:15,140
from a working system and jump in and start hacking on it

00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,990
and building around stuff.

00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:22,990
So to help you out I did a blog on my Medium Blog

00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,960
about my experience teaching WebXR to a bunch

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,440
of eight year olds and they really enjoyed it.

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,110
I had the kind of simple things down.

00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,790
The syntax probably was the hardest part.

00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:39,240
They actually understood 3D geometry pretty well.

00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,810
So I started with this existing Glitch project.

00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,290
Another nice thing about Glitch is that

00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:48,490
you can create your remix without logging in.

00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,730
This is really important because lot of younger kids

00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,080
don't have email addresses,

00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,990
or at least they don't have email that they have unrestricted

00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,130
access to.

00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,380
So creating an account is sometimes not

00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,190
always a possibility.

00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,230
So Glitch works wonderfully for that as well.

00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,390
Syntax was still tricky,

00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,240
so we often did things as a group,

00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,820
where I would be typing on the projector that

00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,991
they would see.

00:21:14,991 --> 00:21:17,090
I also handed then all a cheatsheet.

00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:23,080
This cheatsheet is basically the very basics of

00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,300
what you need to be productive in A-Frame.

00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,770
It doesn't include everything,

00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,880
but it's a single sheet.

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,940
If I did it right, it should print front and back

00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,240
on a single piece of paper

00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,330
and it shows you the syntax.

00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,333
These are some of the common components you'd want to use.

00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,170
Here's how you're gonna load assets, images,

00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,380
and audio and video into your scene.

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,240
The syntax for position and rotation.

00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,790
After forget the positions, meters and rotations

00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,910
in degrees not radians.

00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,210
How to change the color,

00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,710
how to load GLTF models.

00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:01,180
Now finding 360 images, you can create them yourself

00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,180
with a 360 camera and I'm working on a workshop

00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,030
about how to do that,

00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,110
but the new 360 cameras are wonderful,

00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:12,290
but here's also some links for how to find 360 images

00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,530
on Flickr, where to find free sounds.

00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:19,580
I've also created a collection called,

00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,860
I've got it right here.

00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,670
That is also a demo but

00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:32,140
why is that, it's funny these links are all going to,

00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,140
good, I just need to change the text of things.

00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,370
There we go.

00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,970
This is a set of assets I created.

00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,090
These are some acro rectangular images

00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,380
which I had scaled down,

00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,870
so they're reasonable for mobile devices.

00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:49,780
They have nice short names

00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,040
that everything in here will work perfectly

00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,760
and so you can just like click on this link.

00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,840
It's called copy link location.

00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,996
Go back to my workshop.

00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:05,126
Let's change, which one was that.

00:23:05,126 --> 00:23:07,100
The one called office.

00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,950
I'll just change that here.

00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:17,840
Again, load, come on load.

00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,150
Did I get to be here?

00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:25,590
What's next to each, there we go.

00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:29,200
That's all it takes to start building 360 experiences.

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,374
So I created this set of assets.

00:23:31,374 --> 00:23:34,260
There's some beautiful images

00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,360
that can kind of convey what's possible with 360 imagery.

00:23:38,325 --> 00:23:42,090
I also prepped a few models.

00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,420
So it's easy to drop these

00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,120
and again we are just like copy the link

00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,260
and then you add it to your project

00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,400
as a GLTF model resource.

00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,690
You can get more resources,

00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,629
more 3D models on Sketchfab,

00:23:55,629 --> 00:23:57,990
but there is often a conversion process,

00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,370
which is why I added, I hosted all these guys here.

00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,640
What's new with headsets?

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,530
We went over that.

00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,060
What's new with VR cameras?

00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,860
I'm working on a blog about the 360 cameras

00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,160
which will ship next week.

00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,930
I think that'll be on Hacks Blog.

00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,320
What has Mozilla have been working on?

00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,900
So if you check out the Mixed Reality Blog,

00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,870
blogmozvr.com,

00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,340
we started doing weekly updates,

00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:32,120
and we are working on some really cool stuff.

00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,120
We first, the two big projects is first Firefox Reality.

00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,794
So Firefox Reality is a version of the Firefox browser

00:24:40,794 --> 00:24:45,794
designed specifically for a virtual reality environment.

00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,417
So it can show you 2D web pages

00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:52,111
in 3D scene with stuff around you.

00:24:52,111 --> 00:24:56,200
It can show videos with a nice black background,

00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,910
but it can also show VR content.

00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,050
So truly 3D.

00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,590
It's still a work in progress.

00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:05,370
This is a little clip, browsing

00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,720
I guess it's a YouTube video in 3D.

00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,650
We are working on features.

00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,020
So if you're watching video clips,

00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:17,500
how to switch it into scale it, make it more immersive.

00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,380
It's a 360 video, up and all around you.

00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,240
So we are doing a lot of UI experiments.

00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,530
We wanted to make a browser,

00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:29,530
that isn't just for viewing the 2D web in VR,

00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,010
but actually takes advantage of VR

00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,010
and let's you do new unique things.

00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,700
So there's lot of great work on that.

00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,490
We do have daily builds I believe,

00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:46,390
but first public release that we are encouraging

00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,610
people to try it out should be out

00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:49,771
in a week or two.

00:25:49,771 --> 00:25:54,350
And we will have an APK available for I think

00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,140
the Oculus Go and a couple of other headsets.

00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,890
I forgot the exact headsets

00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,674
that we are working on.

00:26:00,674 --> 00:26:03,130
Currently, it does have to side loaded,

00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,670
but we will get that into some app stores

00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:09,420
when we hit the 1.0.

00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:13,060
Another thing we've been working on is called Hubs.

00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,170
There we go.

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,530
Hubs you can think of it as a virtual reality meeting room

00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:24,000
so you can create a new channel or room,

00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,650
entirely hosted by Mozilla.

00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,910
So you just log in and choose a new room name

00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,540
and then you send the link to the other people

00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,930
and they can join you.

00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,350
It's true VR chat.

00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,070
You can hear each other.

00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,586
You can move around the space

00:26:38,586 --> 00:26:40,400
and because it's based on the web,

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,190
there's nothing to install and it works everywhere.

00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:46,110
If you were on your desktop, if you were on a phone

00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,720
without a headset, then it still works.

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,870
If you have a full VR getup,

00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,940
then in works total 3D interactive.

00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,490
You can move your hands around.

00:26:58,322 --> 00:27:00,070
The whole point of the web is that

00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:03,180
everybody can access it from anywhere with whatever device.

00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,790
You'll not have the same experience

00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,640
but you'll still have a usable experience.

00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,010
So Hubs is that for VR

00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,930
and we launched Hubs 1.0 in April

00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,360
and we are currently working on 2.0

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,240
which focused mostly on customization.

00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,140
So letting you customize your avatar,

00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,720
so you build your own rooms,

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,570
letting you bring maybe like a PDF in it,

00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,210
so you could have a shared presentation

00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,100
where you all talk about your slide deck.

00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,460
There is a ton of really interesting things

00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,300
that people are gonna do with Hubs.

00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,850
So I'm really excited about that.

00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,978
So I think that is all of the actual news news

00:27:41,978 --> 00:27:43,470
that I have to talk about.

00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:48,507
Now we have am Etherpad over here.

00:27:48,507 --> 00:27:51,670
So we can start taking some questions.

00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:53,823
Let's see.

00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,010
See since syntax is tricky for younger kids,

00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,940
what about having pre-typed entity in component values?

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,420
In my workshop notes, I'm planning to have a Glitch,

00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,600
where people can remix and type and then have

00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,940
basically notes on the GitHub repo,

00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,280
where you'll be able to copy and paste stuff in.

00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,100
However, I found that with kids who are like eight,

00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,770
even copying and pasting can be tricky

00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,010
because they don't always paste it

00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,133
into the right exact location.

00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:33,133
So I'm looking at some visual tools that are semantically

00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,160
the same as A-Frame.

00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,810
Maybe like the A-Frame Inspector.

00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,368
But and then host it on Glitch

00:28:41,368 --> 00:28:46,110
and see if we can make something where they can

00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,780
drag the objects around, move them in 3D space,

00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,950
set the properties through a visual tool.

00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,510
So semantically it would be the same,

00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:56,120
but for younger kids, I think a visual tool would be better.

00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,810
Is there a way to test Firefox Reality

00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:02,290
without using ADB and Android Studio?

00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,680
Currently no.

00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,600
Technically you don't have to have Android Studio

00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,970
to have ADB, but you do have to enter developer mode

00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,870
and use ADB to side load the application.

00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,100
Eventually, it will be in app stores

00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,640
just like any other app and signed by the relevant stuff,

00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,540
but not currently.

00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,960
Fabien asked how can I use custom protocol

00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,120
of the iOS XRViewer that you showcased

00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,930
in the recent business card demo?

00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:34,713
Yes, so I kind of teased this thing.

00:29:38,196 --> 00:29:39,296
Where did I post that?

00:29:41,128 --> 00:29:42,778
I need to find.

00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:44,070
I don't know where I put the original video,

00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,570
so it's easier to just go back through my Twitter.

00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,650
By the way, you should follow me on Twitter.

00:29:55,650 --> 00:30:00,650
It's all like MR and XR and educational stuff all the time.

00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,480
Did that in July,

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,060
see that was in late June.

00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:08,540
So I did that for a conference I was at.

00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,373
There we go.

00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:34,680
And boom, so what you're seeing here is first

00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,460
I created some business cards with a QR code.

00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,020
I'm scanning it just with a regular camera app.

00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,870
The iOS camera app has QR code scanning built in.

00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,770
It takes you to a special mobile page.

00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,370
But if you click on the demo link,

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,090
it does two things.

00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:54,913
First of all it is not using a regular HTTPS protocol.

00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:00,200
It is calling, I think it was WebXR or something like XRN.

00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:03,320
It's a custom protocol we created just for testing.

00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,360
So that you can have use your regular browser

00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,240
for regular browsing, but then make a link

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,690
that will force it into the XR Viewer.

00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:14,640
The XR Viewer is this experimental browser

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,280
that we have for iOS.

00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,530
That's with loading deck.

00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,430
Once that's done,

00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,080
it's loading a particular page

00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,329
that is looking for a specific image.

00:31:25,329 --> 00:31:28,039
Originally I was actually gonna look for the image

00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:32,230
of the duck on my business card.

00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:36,370
But it turns out the way this image detection works,

00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,480
it needed something like a photograph with

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,760
more feature points.

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,110
The deck was too simple.

00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:46,090
So what it is doing is looking for this particular image

00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:49,490
that I told it, I gave it a copy of the classical marble

00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,830
image, and then when it sees it,

00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,210
it just calls me back saying hey I found that

00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,620
in current 3D space.

00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,100
And then I drop a model in there.

00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,359
And this was just a model of the earth

00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:00,410
that I happened to already have.

00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,000
So how does this work?

00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:07,450
Well you wanna go to WebXR,

00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:15,472
I think for this I need to polyfill.

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,940
It's the, here we go.

00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,780
If we go to, no that's the viewer app.

00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,500
Where is the XR Viewer?

00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,220
There's all our examples.

00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,910
WebXR examples mozilla

00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:39,610
We want this one.

00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,180
Yeah, okay.

00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:47,180
So if you take a look at image detection here,

00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,550
this is one of our standard demos.

00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:55,390
This is in the WebXR polyfill reboot.

00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,900
The code is a little tricky to follow,

00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,130
so I'm gonna be working on a new version,

00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:05,130
but my colleague Blair created this demo.

00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:10,080
So we've added some new WebXR APIs for image detection.

00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,120
It's called an image anchor.

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,440
And it's platform neutral

00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,320
but it's backed by the native platform.

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,694
So since this is running on iOS,

00:33:20,694 --> 00:33:22,940
if I call it create image anchor,

00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,731
it's underneath gonna be calling some ARkit API.

00:33:26,731 --> 00:33:29,034
So you give it the image name

00:33:29,034 --> 00:33:31,987
and the data width and height.

00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,240
Basically this is how big it should be in meters.

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,310
That's one is 20 centimeters.

00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,760
So you describe the image that it should look for

00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,600
by loading up the image and getting the data.

00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Then it creates this object called,

00:33:55,411 --> 00:33:56,861
I don't know where that goes.

00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,920
It's gonna call back with,

00:34:00,898 --> 00:34:05,898
alright I really need to document this

00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,670
'cause somewhere it's creating this image detection object.

00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,470
So you get the image data,

00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,250
create the image anchor and then down here

00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,700
we call activate image detection.

00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,530
Oh I see so we're registering it under a name.

00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,940
And then we tell it to activate image detection

00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,270
for that name, and then when it finds something it's gonna

00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,340
call you back with a transform.

00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:34,020
And using that transform with some annoying math,

00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:38,150
you can now basically create an anchor in space.

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,570
And then you can start attaching things to it.

00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:47,570
So it's still way too tricky to use.

00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,190
So I'm working on an abstraction

00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,020
which will make this a little bit easier,

00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,560
but essentially I took this code

00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,250
and hacked it up for my specific demo.

00:34:58,544 --> 00:35:02,739
Let's send it back here.

00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:03,810
Let's see.

00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,500
What are you most excited about in the WebXR specifications?

00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,790
I'm most excited about things like image detection

00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:16,600
because it's the link between the virtual world

00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,980
and the real world.

00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,760
Currently we can detect the world around you

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,760
in terms of like in terms of plains like flat surfaces,

00:35:27,997 --> 00:35:31,600
but which is great, if I just want like here's the

00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,790
thing and I want to put it on a table.

00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,730
But suppose I go to the museum,

00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,070
how does my phone know which exhibit I'm at

00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,500
in the museum?

00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,294
It could use GPS but GPS is not accurate enough

00:35:43,294 --> 00:35:46,140
for the things I want especially indoors.

00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,740
It can tell you you're at the museum

00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,580
probably maybe which wing,

00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,730
but it's not going to be able to tell

00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,420
like I'm looking at this exhibit versus this exhibit.

00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,610
So with the image detection,

00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,190
we can now further narrow that down

00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,691
and say you're exactly here.

00:35:58,691 --> 00:36:00,688
And your orientation,

00:36:00,688 --> 00:36:05,190
so I can then add graphics to enhance something

00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,102
to roll out that actually lines up

00:36:07,102 --> 00:36:11,738
with something in the virtual world.

00:36:11,738 --> 00:36:13,590
We can really bring them together

00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,586
and that creates so many interesting amazing things.

00:36:16,586 --> 00:36:19,220
And it's not QR codes.

00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,140
It's just images.

00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,990
So it will look pretty.

00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:25,370
You know I imagine lot of these will have like a QR code

00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,980
in the bottom corner to get to the web page,

00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,318
but then just with this page on the museum's website

00:36:31,318 --> 00:36:34,010
I can now have this really cool experience.

00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,680
That's what I'm most excited about.

00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:42,060
What is the process to extend the Mozilla's Hubs scene

00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,620
to make your own presentation in it?

00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,530
That we are actively working on

00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,830
and you're gonna hear from us

00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:51,830
sometime in the next month with the new release

00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,830
how to actually do this.

00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,640
Who is in charge on A-Frame now?

00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,550
Nobody in our organization, specifically

00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,230
it's own governance, how do you see future

00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,320
of this successful framework?

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,261
A-Frame, even though we supported it and put resources

00:37:08,261 --> 00:37:10,380
behind it, it's always been community driven

00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,220
and that is still the case.

00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:17,560
We looked at it and decided it's really

00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:23,050
it's really the best thing in its space.

00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,830
It certainly has flaws especially as you get to building

00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,100
more complicated things.

00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:35,280
But for the space they're in,

00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,010
it works really well.

00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,990
For a certain class of applications, experiences

00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,730
and it's wonderful for learners

00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,690
and there's a rich community.

00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,503
So our goal is to continue growing the community

00:37:47,503 --> 00:37:51,280
and to invest in the underpinnings.

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
A-Frame is built on top of three.js.

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,757
So we've hired, we've gotten some more resources

00:37:56,757 --> 00:38:01,740
to improve three.js, get it running on WebGL 2,

00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,020
get it running with new WebXR APIs,

00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,122
work on performance, improvements, fix bugs,

00:38:08,122 --> 00:38:10,660
support new headsets as they come out.

00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,790
So by improving three.js, we are improving A-Frame.

00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:20,351
A-Frame itself I think is really going great.

00:38:20,351 --> 00:38:23,810
And I don't think we're gonna see many new features

00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:28,810
beyond these support for new headsets and stuff.

00:38:29,213 --> 00:38:31,880
I think all of the really cool new stuff

00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,310
is gonna come from the community.

00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,800
So our goal is to continue supporting that community

00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,100
and encourage people to build more components.

00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:44,340
What is my favorite VR to AR vice versa experience?

00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:50,789
Right now, my favorite VR experience is probably

00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:55,230
the People's House that 20 minute video of touring

00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:58,420
the White House 'cause it shows the potential of 360 video.

00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,922
There are certainly lot of fun games

00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:05,840
but most of the games could still be done on a 2D screen.

00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:11,870
Whereas the 360 view of the White House is totally new.

00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,481
For AR, I'm really excited about these education

00:39:15,481 --> 00:39:18,700
opportunities where you can walk around a space

00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,060
and have it enhanced with further information.

00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,760
There is one actually that I do want to build myself.

00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,870
We have a physical model of solar system here

00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,410
in the town where I live.

00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,077
That's owned by our science museum,

00:39:32,077 --> 00:39:34,708
and it's a one to one billion scale.

00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:39,543
So like there is a sun and like a few meters away

00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,760
is Mercury and 90 meters away is the Earth

00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,880
need if you wanna go all the way up to Neptune,

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,970
it's like four miles away.

00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,800
It is two scale, which is really cool.

00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,840
It gives you that sense of just how big solar system is

00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,678
and how far away it is.

00:39:57,678 --> 00:40:00,580
So what I wanna do is build on augmented reality experience

00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,400
on top of that, so as you go to each planet station,

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,630
you could not only see the physical model of the planet

00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,731
but maybe see zoomed in version with details

00:40:10,731 --> 00:40:14,400
or see its moons actually orbiting around it

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,700
or popup text that tells you more information.

00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:20,747
So that is something that I'm gonna try to build

00:40:20,747 --> 00:40:21,730
this weekend.

00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,160
TensorFlow.

00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,610
TensorFlow is rapidly becoming the defacto reference

00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,830
framework for image detection and more in the web

00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,900
and Mozilla will step in.

00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,250
Especially since the existing Common Voice

00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,900
machine learning research effort.

00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,960
Yes, so I don't know if we are gonna contribute

00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,690
to TensorFlow itself, but we are using it

00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,450
to build other things.

00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:49,705
And TensorFlow JS obviously is very powerful.

00:40:49,705 --> 00:40:53,778
What we're focusing on is making WebAssembly better.

00:40:53,778 --> 00:40:58,760
With WebAssembly, you can take existing

00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,560
C, C++, Rust code,

00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,330
things which are very fast and optimized

00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,600
and existing code like anything in OpenCV

00:41:07,517 --> 00:41:09,481
is gonna be using that.

00:41:09,481 --> 00:41:13,780
In fact I think we have some demos here, yeah.

00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,110
So these marker demos are actually using OpenCV

00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:19,330
like the desktop C++ version

00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:22,620
compiled into WebAssembly running in the browser.

00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:26,400
So WebAssembly gives us the ability to reuse

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,400
these amazing tools and do it fast.

00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:34,593
WebAssembly can run faster than JavaScript

00:41:34,593 --> 00:41:38,250
because it has certain limitations on it

00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:41,211
that make it faster to optimize or easier to optimize.

00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:46,211
The other thing about WebAssembly that we're working on is

00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:51,380
the hooks between WebAssembly and JavaScript and the DOM.

00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:54,220
So hey it's great that I can do all those computer vision

00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,910
processing, but if it takes 20 milliseconds

00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,690
just to get the image into it,

00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,710
to the WebAssembly side and then maybe get the image

00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:05,256
back out, then that's not really helping.

00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:08,300
We are actively working on improving

00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,980
the whole WebAssembly experience

00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,940
and making it possible to do computer vision

00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:16,994
in the browser, purely through WebAssembly library.

00:42:16,994 --> 00:42:20,910
That way vision won't be like hardcoded into the spec.

00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,780
It was like we only use this one algorithm,

00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,520
and that's the algorithm we're gonna use for 20 years.

00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,593
No it will just be a part of your web application.

00:42:28,593 --> 00:42:32,550
But it will be viable to do in the browser

00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,720
instead of having server-based solutions.

00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,193
That's really cool.

00:42:37,193 --> 00:42:38,770
We're gonna lot of exciting stuff.

00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,470
What type of MR experience you think attracts more people?

00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,510
Gaming or common apps?

00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:48,260
Currently probably gaming.

00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,480
There's two things.

00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,900
There is the people who they hear about WebR

00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,390
and they want to try that first experience.

00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:57,260
Game actually probably is not the best thing about it.

00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,400
For someone who is doing their first experience,

00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,470
I recommend something like The Blue

00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:03,933
which is one of these underwater experiences

00:43:03,933 --> 00:43:06,210
where you don't really do anything.

00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,910
You're just there looking

00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:10,360
and you can see the shining light through the water

00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,915
and a big whale swims up,

00:43:11,915 --> 00:43:15,620
and it conveys the potential of immersion.

00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:19,700
So The Blue, that Mars landing thing

00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,160
and of course the People's House video

00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,490
are what I usually start people off with.

00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:27,790
Once I come back, I wanna do more.

00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:31,421
Games are probably first just because at least half of

00:43:31,421 --> 00:43:33,522
everything out there is a game.

00:43:33,522 --> 00:43:37,900
Some early experiments with VR movies.

00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,610
They tend to be short like five to 10 minutes.

00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:44,490
I feel like VR movies aren't just movies in VR.

00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:46,660
It's a new medium and we don't know how to use it yet.

00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,570
So people are still experimenting.

00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,590
But we're gonna get some really cool stuff there.

00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,120
In terms of things more like tools,

00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,180
I think that's gonna come about more from augmented reality

00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,350
where people are gonna use,

00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:05,669
it will start in industrial phases like construction

00:44:05,669 --> 00:44:07,620
or airplane repair.

00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:10,012
Something where someone needs information

00:44:10,012 --> 00:44:11,710
and their hands are busy.

00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:15,823
Once I'm assuming Apple will eventually ship

00:44:15,823 --> 00:44:19,310
like an AR iPhone or something like that,

00:44:20,874 --> 00:44:22,460
at least according to the rumor mill

00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,160
I imagine people will start using them

00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,510
for stuff like cooking.

00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:28,380
My hands are dirty,

00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,260
but I want the cooking instructions

00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,200
or I'm video chatting or something,

00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,580
things people use their phones for today

00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,070
in a hands free space,

00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:38,320
and we're just gonna see how this evolves.

00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,320
Don't think that like you're late to the party.

00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,500
Like it's still such early days,

00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:48,730
and then what we're gonna available in five months

00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:51,990
much less, what we're gonna available by the end of the year

00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:55,290
much less five years is gonna be crazy.

00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:59,910
So don't worry about being too late,

00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:04,260
just experiment, try new things, and share.

00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:10,210
Mostly what people are doing on Twitter with Web VR is

00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,060
just sharing their experiments or cool things they found.

00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,000
It's really exciting.

00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:18,200
Last question here was

00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,780
are there stats about Mixed Reality uses

00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,680
versus personal experience that we can show people

00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,240
just to show where we are.

00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,110
We don't really have stats yet

00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:30,620
and that is something that we're trying to fix.

00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,100
It's definitely a problem.

00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,770
I'm hoping, I assume we have some statistics about

00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:40,330
like number of times the A-Frame library

00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:41,680
is loaded from the CDN.

00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,420
We want to get like a central location

00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,930
of this kind of stuff.

00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:50,310
All I can tell you right now is it's growing,

00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:51,600
but it's really early days.

00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,399
If you do like a Google Trends search for

00:45:54,399 --> 00:45:58,210
things like WebXR, it tends to spike whenever

00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:01,660
a product comes out like when we announced Hubs,

00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,116
there was a big spike and then it drops down.

00:46:04,116 --> 00:46:05,980
It's essentially noise currently

00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:09,060
because we still really are in the experimental stage.

00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,940
The good news is, this is not gonna be

00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,390
something that just disappears.

00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:16,440
This is a long-term technology.

00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,410
It's gonna be a slow burn.

00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:20,570
A lot of big companies are investing in it

00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:22,510
and making good products.

00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,590
A lot of early experiments will fail

00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:26,790
but that's how we learn.

00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:31,870
But it's this is the next part of the web

00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:35,130
and the next part of how people interact with computers.

00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,480
I'm really, really excited.

00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:43,130
Okay do we have another way of taking questions

00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,480
or all the questions they're here?

00:46:49,981 --> 00:46:50,814
I know if there's something else,

00:46:50,814 --> 00:46:51,647
I'll just check.

00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,660
- I think the question are there.

00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:58,820
I don't see any others in the Telegram channel.

00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,270
Havi, do you see anything?

00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:01,670
- No I don't see anything else.

00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:05,730
I was going to drop a last call for questions

00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:07,630
in the Telegram channel.

00:47:09,384 --> 00:47:13,160
And so Josh if,

00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:19,360
is Twitter a good way to reach you

00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,790
or do you have contact info?

00:47:23,714 --> 00:47:26,720
- The best way to reach me, yeah is Twitter

00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:31,350
or just email josh@josh.earth.

00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,950
And my streams...

00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:40,000
There we go.

00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:46,180
- This is where I'm doing all of the classes

00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,940
through the streams.

00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,350
I'm typing this at the top.

00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:50,550
- Oh terrific thank you.

00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:56,490
- And that let's see, specific resources.

00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,790
Follow the Hacks blog and the MozVR blog.

00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:02,730
This one about teaching eight year olds,

00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:05,080
this online Medium Blog.

00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,050
The link right there.

00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:11,710
And this workshop.

00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:21,180
This is the Glitch that I use for the 3D workshop

00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:23,547
or the 360 workshop, Glitch.

00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,450
The really useful part here is

00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:34,490
you can remix it and A-Frame by itself

00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:37,190
doesn't really have a way to remove the scene

00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:39,600
and replace a new one, like there's

00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,130
a prefab component for that, so either one.

00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:49,520
So here is this component, which is standard A-frame

00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,910
kind of stuff,

00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:54,610
but you can use it by saying you're creating

00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:57,915
an entity with a screen component and give it a name.

00:48:57,915 --> 00:48:59,859
And then any object in here,

00:48:59,859 --> 00:49:03,340
you can add a two screen and then the name of

00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,360
the screen that it should go to.

00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,160
And that's all it takes to make these little hotspots.

00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,560
Then you wrap it all inside the screen switch

00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,843
and tell it which screen should be the initial be shown.

00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,550
A-Frame was really easy to extend.

00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:22,280
So I can make this nice wrapped up little component

00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,680
and everything works for it.

00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:31,410
Okay, let's see what other questions.

00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:36,100
Is Linux support for headsets and WebVR on their way?

00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,050
We want it to be.

00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,590
Linux graphics and Linux has always been tricky.

00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,700
But it is a very important platform.

00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:51,305
So honestly I would have to talk to

00:49:51,305 --> 00:49:53,820
our graphics guys to find out

00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,260
what the current support is.

00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,070
It looks like Fabien said yes we hired consultants

00:49:58,070 --> 00:49:59,200
for that a few days ago.

00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:02,140
Okay sweet, that's good.

00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:04,380
So it's coming along.

00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:07,870
- It's great, wow.

00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:09,610
- Any other questions?

00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,740
- That sounded like last call to me.

00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:17,850
- Okay.

00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:20,000
- Back in the channel said you covered a lot of ground,

00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,280
thank you so much Josh.

00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,260
- Thank you all for coming.

00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,470
You guys are in many ways our feet on the ground.

00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:29,700
I can create information,

00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,040
but you're the ones who share it

00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,890
and actually teach people day to day.

00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:36,830
I love doing these updates with you

00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,977
and please email me if you're gonna do

00:50:39,977 --> 00:50:41,950
an event and you want,

00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:43,540
like if you're gonna do a workshop and you want

00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:48,540
certain resources, you want like constructions, email me.

00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,030
I'm putting all those stuff together specifically

00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:52,310
so you guys can work on workshops

00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:55,490
so let me know.

00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:56,740
With that, thank you all.

00:50:57,697 --> 00:50:58,860
- Thank you. - Have a good week.

00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,690
- You as well, stay in touch, thanks again.

00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:05,240
Alright folks you know where to find us.

00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,170
You well, bye-bye.

00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:08,683
