	00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:13,920
so for most of my life I hated giving

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:18,210
presentations as a kid as a teenager as

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,359
a university students I was so scared

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,340
and nervous in front of people that I

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,359
tried to avoid giving presentations as

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:30,449
much as possible because whenever I did

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,750
have to do one I'd basically be a bunch

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:36,719
of nerves for the entire week before the

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,059
event and often because of my nerves the

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,790
presentation would really not turn out

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,860
that great I speed through all my slides

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,050
really quickly and what was supposed to

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,930
be a 30 minute talk would often end up

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,780
as a 10 minutes walk which wasn't great

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,329
so at the time I didn't believe it was

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,760
something that I would ever do well and

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:00,629
I really didn't believe it was something

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:04,049
they were that I would ever enjoy so for

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:07,560
me the secret the magical solution came

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:11,460
from preparation so I find that whenever

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,610
I try to learn something it becomes much

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,710
much easier for me if I understand all

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,750
the different aspects all the different

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:23,100
building books of what it is that I'm

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:26,790
trying to learn so with presentations it

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,250
was about understanding my emotions and

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,420
how my face reacts and how my body a

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:36,869
voice all were affected by my nerves it

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,420
was about understanding how to tell a

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,509
compelling story and how to keep the

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,009
audience engaged it was about

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,750
discovering how often I need to practice

00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:51,899
until I feel completely comfortable with

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,450
what it is that I'm trying to say and it

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,369
was about understanding how to use the

00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:00,960
tools that I have in the most effective

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:04,729
way and alongside our voice and our

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,590
words our slides are basically the most

00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:10,160
important instruments in our kind of

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,500
presenters toolbox

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,610
and we should learn to use them as

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:18,680
effectively as we can so that's what

00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:22,870
this talk is about how to create

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:27,530
effective slides but what does that mean

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:30,440
won't make your slides effective so

00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:32,690
let's take a step back and look at why

00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,410
are we presenting in the first place so

00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:38,600
what's the goal of a presentation and at

00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:42,080
first glance you might think well every

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,990
single presentation is different some

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,170
will be about teaching a new skill or a

00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:50,870
new bit of knowledge some will be to

00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:54,410
convince people to use a specific

00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:56,780
product some will be to inspire or

00:02:54,410 --> 00:03:00,080
motivate people to change or do

00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:03,020
something specific they're kind of

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,450
endless goals of what a presentation is

00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,520
for and no two presentations will ever

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:10,070
be the same

00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:14,810
yet at the heart of it there's one thing

00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:16,760
that they all have in common no matter

00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,550
what your motivation behind the

00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:23,420
presentation is your number one goal as

00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:26,420
a presenter is to allow your audience to

00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,480
absorb your information so whether

00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:33,230
you're trying to teach convince

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:36,350
motivates frighten sell inspire it's

00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:41,090
your responsibility to make that easier

00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:44,300
for the audience so this all ties in

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,660
with the concepts of cognitive load so

00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:50,600
this is the amount of mental activity

00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:52,180
required to accomplish a goal so with

00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,580
mental activity being things like

00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:59,390
perception memory problem-solving things

00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:01,820
like that and this definition comes from

00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:04,340
this book universal principles of design

00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:06,100
and I'll be referring to it quite a

00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,980
couple of times during this presentation

00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:13,100
it's a great resource book covering 125

00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:15,609
design principles and ties it all back

00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:19,609
to psychology and physiology research

00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:21,519
and in the book we also find this quote

00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:24,370
about cognitive load

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:29,110
so design should minimize cognitive load

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:32,169
to the greatest degree possible so when

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,599
we talk about effective slides we mean

00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:38,470
slides that help reduce that cognitive

00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:40,870
load slides that help rather them

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:45,520
prevent people from consuming your

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:48,009
information so how do you create

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,099
effective slides how do you create

00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:54,940
slides that are compelling and help your

00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:57,039
audience so the answer lies I think in

00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:00,310
shifting that question to how do you

00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:03,099
design effective slides so we can get a

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,960
better understanding of sly design if we

00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:08,620
actually look at some proper design

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:12,099
theory so I want to share four

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,720
principles of slide design hoping that

00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:16,919
you can all create more compelling

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,539
slides and basically help your audience

00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:22,870
with absorbing that information that

00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:24,819
you're trying to present to them so one

00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,380
thing to bear in mind here is that I

00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:30,310
don't really believe that there's one

00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:32,620
true way of creating slides so this

00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,650
isn't about getting you all here to

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,659
create the same type of slides that I do

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,610
rather it's helping you all get a basic

00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:42,039
understanding of design theory and

00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:47,110
applying that to your own style and your

00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:50,380
own way of presenting so principle

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:55,479
number one maximize signal minimize

00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:59,169
noise so this principle comes from the

00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:01,419
fury of signal-to-noise ratio so this is

00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:04,180
the concept that in every type of

00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:06,969
communication we have there is a certain

00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,039
amount of relevant information the

00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:13,449
signal and there's a certain amount of

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:16,240
irrelevant information the noise so with

00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:19,180
good designs we want to maximize the

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,490
signal and minimize the noise so ending

00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:26,409
up with mainly relevant information

00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:28,240
rather than irrelevant information so

00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:30,779
how do we do that in our slide sites how

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,610
do we maximize ignore and minimize noise

00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:36,400
so how do we make sure that the

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:40,150
information on our slides is mainly

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,050
relevant rather than irrelevant so I

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,840
think there are a couple of things that

00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:47,139
we can do to achieve that

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:50,199
so first is focus on one purpose per

00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:53,800
slide so this is about maximizing the

00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:56,680
signal so the moments a slide has

00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,360
multiple purposes it dilutes that

00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,719
relevant information that you're trying

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:05,319
to get across surround it and have a

00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:10,300
single slide covering multiple ideas or

00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:13,629
covering different concepts split them

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,639
out over several slides so this is about

00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:17,770
making sure that your slide is as

00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:21,969
relevant as possible to what you are

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:25,180
saying at that point of time so again

00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:28,389
keep in mind that the goal of effective

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:31,840
slides is to allow your audience to

00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:35,229
consume your information so understand

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:39,430
what the purpose of the slide is for

00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:42,699
your audience so this also means two

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,589
things one your slides are not your

00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:46,389
teleprompter

00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:47,020
because at that point they have two

00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:49,389
purposes

00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,879
you're using your slides to get a point

00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:55,330
across to your audience and you're using

00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:57,520
your slides as reminders for yourself so

00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:00,159
if you really need something to help you

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,139
remember what you want to say use your

00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:04,689
presenter notes for that because that's

00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:06,370
what they're there for and doesn't help

00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:08,620
your audience if you're constantly

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:11,039
looking at your slides as a way to

00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:15,069
remind yourself

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:19,300
the second thing your slides are not

00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:22,360
meant as so as notes or references for

00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:24,279
people after your talk so they don't

00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,589
have to be stuck under standing as a

00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:28,569
standalone thing your slides are meant

00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:31,000
for the audience that are there in the

00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:33,669
room with you if you want to share

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,409
something with people afterwards use a

00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:37,779
format that actually makes sense for

00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:41,500
that like a blog post or a video of the

00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:43,599
talk or anything else like that make

00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,590
your audience the number one priority

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:49,780
when you're coming up with the

00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:54,260
purposes of your slides so focus on one

00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:57,410
purpose per slide so one thing I happen

00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:00,260
I like one thing I see happen a lot is

00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:03,350
using bullet points on one slide to

00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:06,860
cover multiple ideas so for instance

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:08,300
take this slide about cats facts so if

00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,940
you're going to be talking for a few

00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:14,600
minutes about the history of house cats

00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:16,310
and then a few minutes about why cats

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,130
sleep seventy five percent of their

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,740
lives and then a few minutes about each

00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:24,590
of all the other points you're basically

00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,840
diluting the signal of every point that

00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:29,120
you're trying to make because while you

00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,970
are talking about the brief history of

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,290
house cat your audience is reading and

00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,050
thinking about all the other stuff that

00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:40,010
you already have on that slide and they

00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:42,950
won't necessarily be listening to you so

00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:47,000
it's much better to split out those

00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:50,180
ideas over several slides so allow your

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,460
audience to focus on that one thing that

00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:55,640
you're trying to get across what is the

00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:59,030
most relevant information for the people

00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,700
at the time now I'm not saying that you

00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:03,890
shouldn't be using bullet points at all

00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:06,680
but use them to support the specific

00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:09,260
purpose of your slide so for instance in

00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:12,100
this case the bullet points are used to

00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:15,320
list a set of names that belong together

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:19,430
so all the information together is what

00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:21,560
makes it relevant another exception is

00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:23,570
when you're using it to recap or give an

00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,360
overview of all the things that you said

00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:29,690
earlier so this slide actually has the

00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,910
same exact contents as before but in

00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:35,030
this scenario you've covered each of

00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:37,220
those points already so the purpose here

00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:40,280
is to show stuff that you've covered

00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,810
before in one single slide so the

00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,810
audience doesn't have to focus as much

00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:47,780
on each of the several points because

00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:49,010
none of it is new information because

00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:55,640
they've each been dealt with separately

00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:57,650
already so with purpose context matters

00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:01,250
a huge amount

00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:03,620
so keep that in mind the second thing we

00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:06,500
want to do is make sure our slides

00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:09,589
aren't distracting so in this case we're

00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,390
trying to minimize noise so ensuring

00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:15,350
that we don't have any irrelevant

00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:18,470
information so one example of this is

00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:21,020
having way too much text on your slides

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:23,120
so in a moment you have a slide like

00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:25,220
this people stopped listening to you

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,660
because they're either distracted by

00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,150
trying to read all the stuff that's on

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,270
there or they get distracted trying to

00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:35,300
read and listen at the same time so

00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:37,040
question to everyone here did any of you

00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:40,940
just try to read all the text that was

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:44,470
on there rather than listening to what I

00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:48,740
was saying right

00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:51,620
so rather than allowing your audience to

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,930
focus on what you're saying by having

00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,880
that much text you're basically kicking

00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,589
off all these different questions or

00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,480
thoughts that are going through people's

00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:01,760
head when they're are trying to reading

00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,660
when they are trying to read that type

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,430
of text so think about what information

00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:11,570
really really matters and just distill

00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:13,970
it down to the very essential a

00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:18,529
variation of this is having too much

00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:20,000
code on a single slide I tend to see

00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:22,430
this quite a lot in technical

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,680
presentations where people just want to

00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:28,370
show everything that they have but most

00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:30,410
of the time doesn't really matter most

00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:33,350
of the time you don't need all of it

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:36,050
instead focus on the parts that's

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:38,380
actually matters to the audience what is

00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,970
the thing that you are trying to explain

00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,830
because basically by trying to force

00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,560
people to read all that stuff you're

00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:49,130
only creating a situation for people to

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,050
zone out and not listen to you another

00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,630
waste lines can be distracting is just

00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:56,510
when it's too much going all in them

00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:58,970
this is a very extreme example but I

00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:00,440
often feel that people want to use all

00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:03,440
the space that they can on a slide

00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:07,430
making things super busy and much much

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:10,860
harder to process so keep your slides

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:14,100
simple and clean so that do not vision

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,980
distracting so this shows exactly the

00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,690
same images as we saw before but because

00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,210
they're not overlapping and because

00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:23,550
there's no text laid over it's much

00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:26,190
easier for the audience to process

00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:28,280
you're reducing that cognitive load for

00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:32,940
the audience

00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:36,000
so to recap maximize signal by focusing

00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:38,220
on one purpose per slide and you can

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,830
minimize noise by reducing distractions

00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,830
or your slide so I only gave a couple

00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:46,230
examples of how these apply to each of

00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:48,450
them but in a lot of different ways that

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:51,950
your slides can be distracting or how

00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:55,470
you can maybe not focus on one purpose

00:13:51,950 --> 00:14:00,780
so principle number two make important

00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:03,360
information stand out so again let's go

00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:08,070
back to some theory so the phone

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:10,140
restorff effects is phenomenal I never

00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:12,810
can say that weird phenomenon where

00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:16,020
you're more likely to remember things

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:18,900
that are noticeably different than

00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:21,570
things in our colon so this is about

00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,760
making things look more unique or

00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:28,470
distinctive so that it stands out more

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:32,040
and that people will remember them so

00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:35,540
this is basically what the definition of

00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:39,060
contrast is so it's a state of being

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:43,650
strikingly different from something else

00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:46,290
in juxtaposition or close association so

00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:50,640
what we want is to use contrast in

00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:52,980
Airlines to make things memorable so a

00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,070
good example of using contrast comes

00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,650
from this book from Nancy Drew arts

00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:01,860
which is all about how to make good

00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:04,430
presentations in it she explains

00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:07,470
contrast through dis visualization

00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:09,660
highlighting how we can use contrasts in

00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:13,140
our slides and a couple of different

00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:15,900
ways using color shape size shade and

00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:19,230
proximity so in each of these examples

00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:22,020
you're automatically drawn to the

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:25,600
element that sounds

00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:28,300
so I'll only cover free of them here and

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,090
give examples for each of them so I

00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:34,840
think shade in a way is a variation of

00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:39,240
color and proximity I think isn't as

00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:42,850
easy to apply as some of the other cells

00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:48,130
so I'll give examples for each of these

00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:50,230
three areas starting with color so first

00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:53,050
step is choose a color palette with

00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:55,570
contrasting colors so in the case of

00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:58,840
color contrasting doesn't necessarily

00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:01,330
have to mean exact opposites it's more

00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,020
about having colors that work well

00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,090
together

00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,590
and yet are different enough from each

00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:08,530
other that you can see that they are

00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:11,260
noticeably different so I won't go into

00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:13,420
too much detail here about color theory

00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,400
because there are plenty of websites and

00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:20,230
books out there that already covered

00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:23,860
this one of them though is color supply

00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:26,410
go home with free wise and I really like

00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:29,290
this website it allows you to quickly

00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:32,620
try out various color combinations and

00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:35,290
it shows different variations of those

00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,630
colors so it allows you to play around

00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:42,910
with colors that might pop out and

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:45,400
appeal to you and also has links to

00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:47,050
various resources explaining color

00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,490
theory and stuff like that so if you

00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:52,420
don't know much about it it's a good

00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:55,420
place to start what I really like though

00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:58,750
is that it also shows you how does

00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:02,170
colors look together in patterns and

00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:04,570
icons so you can already get a sense of

00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:06,310
what type of contrast you might get if

00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:09,490
you're using those colors

00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:11,920
in your slides so it goes beyond just

00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:14,290
showing you the color palettes it

00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:18,160
actually shows you how things look like

00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:21,270
together so one way of using color

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,610
contrast in your slides is to use it

00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:27,459
within a single slide to highlight the

00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:29,130
most important phrase or kind of piece

00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:32,610
of information that you have

00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:34,320
so going a bit meta you'll have noticed

00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:38,460
that most of my own slides have been

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:42,299
following this exact pattern so we have

00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:44,580
a blue background with white text and

00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:46,799
then a nice piece of yellow text to

00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:50,760
highlight the key information on that

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:52,950
slide so as I mentioned before the

00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,410
colors don't need to be too opposite to

00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:59,580
each other so you can use the same color

00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:01,320
like green and achieve contrast from the

00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:07,380
different variations the different

00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:09,659
shades of green yeah I'm assigned using

00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:13,380
contrast within slides you can also look

00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:16,940
at contrast between slides so if you use

00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:19,409
keynotes this is the light table hue

00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:22,559
which basically gives you an overview of

00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:23,970
all your slides together and I use it

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,980
quite a lot so you just get a bit of a

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:29,880
holistic sense of how do my slides to

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:32,309
look like as a whole so this is an

00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,580
overview of one of my presentations from

00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:39,630
last year about lessons that we could

00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:42,390
learn from the Marvel superheroes and I

00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:44,490
basically each time use a red slide at

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,900
the start of a section to highlight that

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,690
we were switching to a different

00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,039
superhero and because all the other

00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,740
slides are right

00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:55,020
the Reds haidle slide just stands out

00:18:52,740 --> 00:19:00,750
much much more and it makes people stop

00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:03,419
and pay attention to it it's a second

00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:06,480
way to use contrast is through shapes

00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:09,690
now traditionally when we think of

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,760
shapes you think of things like well in

00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:15,120
death examples circles squares triangles

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,059
stuff like that and well they can be

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,320
used within your slides for contrast

00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:22,700
they aren't actually the shapes that we

00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:26,429
rely on the most in our presentations

00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:29,250
what we rely on a lot are false which

00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:31,620
are formal shapes so one way of

00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:34,020
achieving contrast is through using

00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:37,169
different fonts within your

00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:40,590
presentations so I tend to use custom

00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:42,080
fonts quite a lot because the fonts that

00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:44,419
are built into our systems

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,149
are mostly designed for reading

00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:49,880
paragraphs of text so they don't quite

00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:53,570
work as well when you see them on the

00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:57,019
slide but also people are already

00:19:53,570 --> 00:20:00,039
familiar with them so they don't really

00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:07,669
stand out that much and it makes it

00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:09,470
easier for people to kind of yeah it's

00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:12,289
easier for people to kind of overlook

00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:15,730
them and and and not appreciate them as

00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:19,130
much as they as a fault

00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:21,080
which once you end up using though it's

00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:23,240
quite a personal choice and it will

00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,429
depend on your presentation style and

00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:29,840
what type of feeling you want your

00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:32,450
slides to exhibit if you don't want to

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:36,320
spend any money the first place I look

00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:38,980
is google fonts because most of all

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,929
almost all the phones here are

00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:44,510
downloadable for free so the main focus

00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:47,210
of the collection is in providing the

00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,279
fonts as web faults but you can just

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:54,440
download them and use them in your slide

00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:57,169
editors as well if you're willing to pay

00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:00,919
for fonts I suggest taking a look at the

00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:03,740
bundles on these types of websites so

00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:06,740
rather than buying a single font you end

00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,750
up buying a bundle of fonts that kind of

00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,779
go well together and they often include

00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:15,230
quite a large and interesting selection

00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:17,419
for not that much money and there will

00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:20,179
be also be examples of how to use them

00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:24,950
how to combine them and it's a good way

00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:27,860
to learn how to use these fonts most of

00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:32,210
these will also have free bundles or

00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:34,909
free fonts per week or per month so it's

00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:38,720
a good place you just start subscribing

00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:40,639
to stuff and and start learning what

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,799
type of fonts appeal to you and what

00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:45,620
type of fonts are things that you'd like

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,720
to see more often you slowly

00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:50,720
well you quickly actually get a sense of

00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:54,460
which fonts are ones that you like in

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,679
which might work well on the slide

00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,360
so once you have those multiple fonts

00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:01,629
you can start playing around with them

00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:04,330
to create contrast so I'll show a couple

00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:06,460
examples but again this by no means the

00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:09,279
only ways that you can create contrast

00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,509
it's more just a way to kind of give you

00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:13,659
a sense of what type of things you

00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:16,360
should be thinking of so in this first

00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:18,669
example we are using different fonts

00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:21,490
within the same phrase or the same

00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:23,799
sentence so the contrast is used to

00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:28,269
highlight specific words within that

00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:29,980
phrase second way is using different

00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:32,649
fonts for different elements on the

00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:35,139
slide so it's about making it easier for

00:22:32,649 --> 00:22:36,789
the audience to understand different

00:22:35,139 --> 00:22:40,809
purposes or the different elements

00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:42,639
within that slide for instance if it was

00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:45,309
all the same text it would just be much

00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:48,039
much more confusing for the audience to

00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:50,049
read and comprehend it's about reducing

00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:52,299
that cognitive load again they're making

00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:57,159
things easier for your audience to

00:22:52,299 --> 00:23:00,279
absorb so in this case if we go back one

00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:05,169
forms is the quote and one coat one font

00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:07,299
is the person that said the quote so the

00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:09,490
same is true when you're displaying code

00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:12,460
if you've got multiple elements on your

00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:14,289
slide which have different purposes use

00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:17,499
contrasts is show that they are

00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:19,629
different so in this case we've got our

00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:24,429
code and we've got some comments about

00:23:19,629 --> 00:23:26,320
what that code actually does it's a

00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:30,639
third way to use contrasts is through

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:33,519
size so the simplest way of using size

00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:35,889
is just grabbing a single elements and

00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:39,850
making a bigger so using it to make

00:23:35,889 --> 00:23:41,710
statements about something or you can

00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:43,990
play around and make each part of the

00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:45,700
sentence a different size so again you

00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:47,440
have noticed this is a pattern that I

00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:51,759
tend to use quite a lot within my own

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,279
slides well becomes really interesting

00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:56,860
though is when you start pairing

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,419
different fonts with different sizes so

00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,470
means that you can really play around

00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:04,659
making a slide look quite graphic and

00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:07,840
these type of slides will stand out more

00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:11,170
and make it more compelling to people

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,570
so in the case in some of these cases

00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:15,970
the contrast is both within the slide

00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:20,860
and outside of the slide so making them

00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:23,470
more memorable in general so those are

00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:26,260
free ways that you can use contrast to

00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:29,110
highlight key information and make it

00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:33,150
more memorable for your audience so for

00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:33,150
color shape and size

00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:43,580
so principle number three is

00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:46,920
show-and-tell

00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:50,040
so this pick this principle comes from

00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:52,800
the picture superiority effects which

00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:56,460
states that information recall is better

00:24:52,800 --> 00:25:00,390
when combining text and images so rather

00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:03,120
than relying on purely text alone we

00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:05,880
should be using visuals to support what

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,430
we are saying so people remember things

00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:12,450
better if they're absorbing the info

00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:14,130
both in text and individual way so I

00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:19,100
want to talk about four different ways

00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:19,100
of adding visuals to your presentations

00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:25,950
so first photos so photos are the

00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:29,010
easiest way of adding visual serious

00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:32,910
lights making them more lively and more

00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:36,120
memorable the finger photos and also

00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:39,330
with gifts is that they do need to be

00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,610
relevant to what you are saying so again

00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:45,660
keep principle number one in mind

00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:48,990
maximize signal minimize noise the

00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:51,480
moment that a photo or a gif isn't

00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:58,260
relevant or if the connection is too

00:25:51,480 --> 00:26:00,630
tenuous the photo only becomes noise so

00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:03,180
the main place that I still go to find

00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:06,570
my photos is Flickr specifically for

00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:08,490
their Creative Commons search because it

00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:12,030
means that you can easily search for

00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:14,550
images with specific licenses so making

00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:18,630
it's easier to know whether or not you

00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:21,900
can use them in the first place another

00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:25,710
place I go to is pixels they have a huge

00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:28,610
collection of free to stock images again

00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:31,290
while they can be really really pretty

00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:34,560
again the main thing to keep in mind is

00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:36,660
that they need to be relevant if they're

00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:40,490
not it's better to just use an abstract

00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:43,350
background or a solid color so don't use

00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:45,420
don't use photos for the sake of using

00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:47,790
photos because if they're not relevant

00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,920
then you're only making it harder for

00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:52,670
your audience on

00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:55,370
said so I mentioned these design bundles

00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:59,540
earlier but again some of these also

00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:02,020
have collections of images and are great

00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:04,910
resources for that as well I recently

00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:08,150
got a collection that had like a

00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:10,610
thousand abstract backgrounds so I'm

00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:15,650
kind of set for life with my backgrounds

00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:18,710
for slides so this is way to use a photo

00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:23,030
is to use them to completely fill up the

00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:27,230
screen and then pair in some way with

00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:29,120
text over it so just to compare you can

00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:31,550
see that if you use the much smaller

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:35,330
image it just doesn't have as much

00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:37,190
emotional impact the image this way

00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:40,850
actually makes that slide much more

00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:42,380
distracting so by using the image as

00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:44,750
kind of a background image you're

00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:47,690
driving that point home much much more

00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:49,490
and if you use the right image the

00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:52,370
audience hat will have a much more

00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:54,890
visceral reaction making the slide more

00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:56,540
memorable and easy to remember which is

00:27:54,890 --> 00:28:00,650
the entire points of what you're trying

00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:02,960
to do so play around and experiment with

00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:06,230
different photos and with different

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:11,900
fonts because changing either can make a

00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:14,060
slide fuel quite different keep in mind

00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:16,940
out that not every photo will work

00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:19,610
that's kind of a background image even

00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:22,700
though this is an adorable photo of a of

00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:25,250
a cute kitten you can't really read that

00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,960
text that easily

00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:30,320
so if you really want to use that photo

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,460
look at using things like masks to turn

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,530
the photo into a specific shape or size

00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:38,510
it makes the image just stand out

00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:42,020
slightly more and it look makes it look

00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:45,080
like you've it makes it less like you've

00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:47,240
just plugged the image into your

00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:51,680
presentation especially if you have a

00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:54,080
series of slides with photos on it make

00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,630
sure they all just have the same size of

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,020
image it makes it look much more

00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:59,020
coherent

00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:07,880
so the next way to add visual serious

00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:11,330
lights is icons so the easiest resource

00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:13,840
for icons is the noun project so this

00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:17,210
website features a tongue of

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,880
royalty-free icons of all different

00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:23,450
topics and you're bound to find icons in

00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,850
there that you can use I had to try and

00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:28,940
they even have stuff for like synergy

00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:31,730
and other words like that you'd be

00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:35,840
surprised how many words they've got

00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:37,730
pictures icons for again I'm mentioning

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,980
design bubbles because that's where most

00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:42,400
of the icons of this presentation come

00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:46,220
from so again 9/10 you use that a lot

00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:50,000
and the thing of icons though is that

00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:52,220
they work as nice little highlights to

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,280
cement the text that you're already

00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:57,830
showing so it's a lot less distracting

00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:00,680
the photos but it's enough of a memory

00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:03,380
cue that it will help people recall

00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:06,860
information and make your slides just

00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:09,620
that little bit more memorable so the

00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:13,010
third way of adding visuals is through

00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:15,470
shapes so in this case with shapes I

00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:17,960
mean use the shapes that are built into

00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:19,300
your editors so you can make lines

00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,910
triangles

00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:25,220
circles squares stuff like that and you

00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:27,230
can achieve quite a lots when you start

00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:30,280
combining them to create really

00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:33,080
interesting visuals for your slides so

00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,870
one example is to create a really simple

00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:38,330
pie chart it just makes the stats and

00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:42,380
out a little bit more but in this case

00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:44,510
it's not actually that tricky to make so

00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:48,710
looking behind the scenes this is built

00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:51,890
up from two elements a circle which is

00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:54,350
yellow and a blue square which is the

00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:56,660
same color as the background image so

00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:59,180
it's not even a weird shape that you

00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:03,170
need to draw it's it's just two images

00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:04,640
overlaid on top of each other once you

00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:06,710
start getting the hang of shapes you can

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,110
start constructing much more interesting

00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:12,440
slides like this so building diagrams

00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:17,690
that are much clearer than relying on

00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:21,320
alone for instance this type of graph is

00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:27,020
much more visible and memorable than

00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:29,180
just having a simple list of items it

00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,850
makes it much more graphic and it makes

00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:35,540
it much more easy for people to

00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:37,850
understand what you're trying to do and

00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:40,180
finally if you combine shapes with fonts

00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:43,400
and photos you can really start making

00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:47,000
your slides look more unique and give

00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:49,130
them more personality so find combine

00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,070
these things into something that speaks

00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:56,690
to you and kind of represents you as a

00:31:52,070 --> 00:32:03,320
speaker so to find a way to add visuals

00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:05,930
is animations so before sharing some

00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:09,590
examples I need to remind you not to

00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:13,070
much misuse animations so most

00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:15,200
presentation editors they support a lot

00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:17,600
of different animations and quite

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,260
frankly most of them like the one that

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:24,620
you just saw are super distracting kind

00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:28,730
of looks cool but is it useful not

00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:30,710
really so if you use animations try to

00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:33,860
make sure that the animation that you're

00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:37,490
using makes sense for the purpose of the

00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:39,560
slides if it is distracting make sure

00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:43,430
the benefits of using it outweigh the

00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:46,310
downsides so one of the most powerful

00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:49,850
animations within keynote is magic move

00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:53,720
so this idea is basically you grab an

00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:58,450
element like a shape a fonts photo so in

00:32:53,720 --> 00:33:03,350
this example it's a small black circle

00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:05,840
and then in the next slide you copy that

00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:08,510
same circle but change it in some

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,640
specific way so put in a different

00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:13,970
position make it bigger or smaller

00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,460
whatever and then keynote will just

00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:19,040
automatically figure out what your

00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,360
animations should be so you don't really

00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,570
have to play around with like

00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,830
positioning

00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:27,330
and trajectories or anything like that

00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:30,210
keno does all the smart stuff for you

00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:32,190
all you're doing is having the thing in

00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:35,070
one state on one slide and the next

00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:36,750
state on the other slide so you

00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:40,860
basically end up with something like

00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:43,200
this so you can use it to very quickly

00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:47,520
move things around and give some

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:50,430
movement to them so I mainly like to use

00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,890
animations in places where by using them

00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:58,050
you're making it easier for the audience

00:33:52,890 --> 00:34:02,010
to grasp some idea or concept so for

00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:04,920
instance in timelines so you're using

00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:07,770
the movement to create this illusion of

00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:10,680
a timeline so making it easier for your

00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:13,710
other audience to understand so in using

00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:17,370
animations think of things that will

00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:20,160
make it easier for the audience to grasp

00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:22,320
are the specific diagrams or charts that

00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:25,230
might be easier to understand if you

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,360
have that animation in them if it

00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:31,380
doesn't have the purpose behind it then

00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:34,230
don't use the animation so those are

00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:37,050
four ways that you can add visuals to

00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:40,980
your slides so using both text and

00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:43,290
images or icons or anything like that it

00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:46,350
means that your audience will be able to

00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:50,940
grasp your ideas and concepts much much

00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:54,930
quicker and remember them more so the

00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:57,900
final principle is be consistent so when

00:34:54,930 --> 00:35:00,390
we hear consistent I think some people

00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:02,910
interpret that as let's make everything

00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:05,250
look the same I'll use the same

00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:08,340
background and the same fault for every

00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:12,750
single slide and that's not really what

00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:13,910
I mean here so in design consistency is

00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:17,460
defined like this

00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:20,340
the usability of a system is improved

00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:23,780
when similar parts are expressed in

00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:27,060
similar ways so when we're talking about

00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:30,000
consistency in slide design it's about

00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:33,900
making sure that those slides that are

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,540
similar look and feel the same and I

00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:40,470
think slides are similar if they have a

00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:43,560
similar purpose so a bit of a mouthful

00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:46,860
but use consistent designs for slides

00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:50,400
for the same purpose so this is all

00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:52,890
about identifying your slide patterns so

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,680
what are the types of slides within your

00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:58,440
presentation and and then trying to make

00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,590
sure that you end up following the same

00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,470
patterns for those slides so I'll use

00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:06,630
this presentation as an example because

00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:09,290
for the past 30 minutes or so you've

00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:12,690
been exposed to some of these patterns

00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:15,030
so this presentation had D heading

00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:19,920
slides they were bright and yellow and

00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:22,800
it's trying to make them stand out we

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:26,040
then had our design theory slides which

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,070
are all a darker blue background and a

00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:32,760
different type of fault we had our

00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:35,400
example slides which are white with an

00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:38,160
example in the middle and then we had

00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:41,400
all our other slides which all followed

00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,820
the basic design of blue to a blue

00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:48,990
background white text and yellow text to

00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:53,370
highlight with different variations of

00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:57,000
it's one thing to note here is that all

00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:58,770
the images within this always we're

00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:04,170
consistent so they always followed that

00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:06,560
same pattern that same size of yeah

00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:11,040
making that a coherent whole

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:13,020
so the handy thing of breaking down your

00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,810
slides in this way it means that for

00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:19,200
future presentations you have much more

00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:20,370
tangible building blocks to use and as

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,110
you end up doing more and more

00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:24,360
presentations you end up building your

00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:26,910
own library of patterns that you can

00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:29,880
reuse and it becomes easier and quicker

00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:31,500
to put your slides together and those

00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,780
are starts making you think about your

00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,030
presentations in terms of these building

00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:38,780
blocks what are the patterns that you're

00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:43,140
trying to get across to your audience

00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:46,440
so identify your slide patterns what are

00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:50,190
the types of slides that will be in your

00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:52,579
presentations so those are four

00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:56,819
principles of slide design

00:37:52,579 --> 00:38:00,000
so to recap maximize signal minimize

00:37:56,819 --> 00:38:05,490
noise make important information stand

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:08,400
out show and sell and be consistent so I

00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:11,160
hope that by applying these you make it

00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,500
easier for your audience to consume the

00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:16,200
information that you're presenting and

00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:22,859
create more effective and beautiful

00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:25,490
presentations so if you had told me 10

00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:28,710
years ago that nowadays I would

00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:31,230
regularly be giving presentations and

00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:32,750
actually enjoying it I am most probably

00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:36,390
wouldn't have believed you

00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:39,329
at the time I assumed that to give a

00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:42,900
good presentation I would need to focus

00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:45,960
a lot on me making sure that what I say

00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:48,960
is good and correct making sure that I

00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,650
don't make a fool of myself making sure

00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,900
that I don't and I'm too much

00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:57,630
in reality though the me part all the

00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:01,710
presentation isn't the most important

00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:04,349
thing good presentations are all about

00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:07,220
the audience it's your job as a

00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:12,690
presenter to make sure that you teach

00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:14,930
inspire and motivate your audience and

00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:17,670
I'll leave you with this single quote

00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:20,609
there's not much point in spinning a

00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:24,500
yarn if your audience keeps losing the

00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:27,610
thread so thanks for listening

00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,610
[Music]

00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:38,020
it's this mic yes hi

00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:40,750
um it's sorry let me try it right here

00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:43,510
we have a little time I think for some

00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:45,580
questions from the audience you and the

00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:49,030
audience may not know that there's also

00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:53,110
a global audience listening to this talk

00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:55,210
live streamed in countries all over the

00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:58,950
world where there are Mozilla tech

00:39:55,210 --> 00:40:01,840
speakers and so I have some questions

00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:04,510
here that have come in from that

00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:07,120
audience as well but let me see if we

00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:09,190
can switch back and forth a bit so if

00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:12,610
there's anyone in the room all right

00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:17,860
I'll be the mic runner here Christo's

00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:19,840
why don't you start us off thank you

00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:22,930
thank you so much for the presentation I

00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:26,590
have a quick question about the designs

00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:28,600
of the slide you talk a lot about you

00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:31,720
know colors style guides and things like

00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:34,330
that but when it comes to a template

00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,340
that it's under to you by your by a

00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:39,640
company or by a conference and you don't

00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:46,600
have a lot of space to customize or to

00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:49,390
work on what you can do it there um so I

00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:53,530
think even in those cases you can still

00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:55,600
follow those principles I think a lot of

00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:59,560
templates that that get handed to us

00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:01,390
they're actually created with the

00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,190
opposite in mind where there can be lots

00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:04,690
and lots of information on one slide and

00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:08,680
I think you can still distill it down

00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:11,710
and and make it simpler to understand so

00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:13,660
even if there's stuff already on the

00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:15,760
slide that that have to be there you can

00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,860
make sure at least that the rest of what

00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,930
you're adding doesn't make it more

00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:22,210
distracting so I think there's still

00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:24,430
stuff there where yeah just keep those

00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:25,870
principles in mind and do the best that

00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:27,400
you can with it

00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:31,270
but yeah sometimes there will be cases

00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:35,960
where we're really we need to use the

00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:44,100
stuff that is given to us and just yeah

00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:48,119
try to make the deal with it first

00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:50,490
Belinda so III know it's not about

00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:54,570
design and although I could talk about

00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:57,600
design all day but you said that when

00:41:54,570 --> 00:42:01,440
you do your slides you kind of go

00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:04,440
through them quite a few times do you

00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:08,609
recommend that because for example I I

00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:12,090
don't practice for example I just know

00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:16,380
what I'm just so I think it depends a

00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:20,790
lot per person but I think especially

00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:23,220
when when you're given a time limits at

00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:24,960
least having done a rehearsal once and

00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:27,750
making sure that you know exactly how

00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:32,070
long your your talk is going to be I

00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:34,160
think I think doing rehearsal is good I

00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:37,109
think it also goes back to that idea of

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,600
you know you're doing these talks and

00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:42,840
these slides for the audience so I think

00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:45,630
people owe it to their audience to

00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:50,670
rehearse and make sure that they get the

00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:53,550
best off of what you're talk I notice

00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:56,220
for myself at least that if I just give

00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:57,990
a talk like that I tend to ramble and

00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,910
waffle on too much so a half hour we're

00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:01,380
talking about to now turn into like a 45

00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:03,150
minutes or already other way around

00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:05,369
where I'll forget what I want to say and

00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:07,500
it will turn out to be way too short so

00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:09,810
for me to practice is really to make

00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,130
sure that I can get it get it exactly

00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:13,500
spot-on

00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:16,940
I guess you know this is why I find

00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:20,369
interesting because um I see presenting

00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:23,730
like storytelling and so if you miss

00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:26,520
something that's fine you know because

00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:28,500
people get really but she where people

00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:31,109
do her sauce they kind of go right I

00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,250
need to make sure I include this include

00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:35,090
that and that's why you look at the

00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:38,190
speaker notes and they end up kind of

00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:39,270
you regretting that you've just said

00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:41,460
something cause you didn't have to get

00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:43,440
back and then you get this frenzy of

00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,510
like oh I need to make sure I bring that

00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,200
up again and you know where if you just

00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:50,920
kind of go okay I'm

00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:53,920
in the story of what I need to tell you

00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:56,589
then suddenly your muscle relaxed and

00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:59,140
you're not kind of like I think it

00:43:56,589 --> 00:44:01,300
depends on personality types cuz I think

00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:03,250
I have the opposite where if I don't

00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,290
prepare I won't be relaxed for the

00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:08,140
actual talk that I give so the more

00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:09,940
often I do it the more relaxed I will

00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:11,950
actually be because I can almost go on

00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:13,180
autopilot but yeah I completely

00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:15,099
understand that for some people the

00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:17,380
opposite might be true and over

00:44:15,099 --> 00:44:18,250
preparing might cause them to overthink

00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:20,890
things

00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:23,079
but I think part of it is just

00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:26,680
recognizing what type of presenter you

00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:30,220
are and understanding what helps you and

00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:32,079
following that pattern yeah again I

00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:34,270
don't think there's one true way for

00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:39,210
everyone it's more about recognizing

00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:39,210
what that is for you and following that

00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:44,500
yeah thank you also a million-dollar

00:44:41,859 --> 00:44:45,849
stick presentation um my question was

00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:49,240
more around saying you were delivering

00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:52,300
training all running a course how does

00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:54,099
that cause the slide creation to differ

00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,839
because especially you know for example

00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:58,540
even an online course a lot of those now

00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:00,839
are essentially someone speak in you

00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:02,920
know auditory over a visual presentation

00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:05,530
but because there's obviously course

00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:08,470
content absolutely must be delivered

00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:09,730
does that then mean that that's gonna

00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:11,470
affect the slides it turns out the

00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:13,119
amount of text that you have content

00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:17,530
required what were your thoughts on that

00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:21,069
um so my thoughts sensibie that's if

00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:22,900
there is additional material then that

00:45:21,069 --> 00:45:25,270
should be provided in a different way so

00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:29,470
like have a link on the slide that

00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:32,140
people can look up what that material is

00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:35,230
or have a QR code in your your slide so

00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:37,869
you don't necessarily have to have all

00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:41,020
that information in your slide but make

00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:43,990
it readily available for people to have

00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:46,420
alongside what you are presenting if

00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:49,359
that really matters again it's about

00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:51,609
that idea of you know what are you

00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:54,579
trying to do at that point of time and

00:45:51,609 --> 00:45:56,560
is having it all one single slide the

00:45:54,579 --> 00:45:58,870
best way of getting that across to

00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:01,420
people

00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:03,190
yeah I've had a couple of times where

00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:05,470
I've done workshops where I'll have the

00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:07,270
slice that I presents and I'll have like

00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:10,060
the handouts that I give to people which

00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:11,650
are two different things because the

00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:13,360
handout sort of thing that people wants

00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:16,170
in front of them while they're listening

00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:22,030
to the other stuff that I'm going over

00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:24,090
yeah thank you for this presentation I

00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:27,970
have a question about the principles you

00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:30,100
listed them in a specific order is it by

00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:32,140
because the first one is more important

00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,980
than the first one or was it just for

00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:39,550
another reason

00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:41,920
um I I think I presented them in that

00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:55,930
order because I think they build on top

00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:57,220
of each other so I think so I think you

00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:59,290
need to start with the first one because

00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:01,660
that's is I think the most important one

00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:06,760
I know it's or one where which most

00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:09,190
people nowadays don't tend to do but

00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,830
then once you understand how to apply

00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:13,540
dad's I think the second part is well

00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:17,380
from the information that you have on

00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:19,300
your slide and if the information that

00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:22,600
you have on your slide isn't distracting

00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:24,610
or what from that could you make sand

00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,020
out how do you use contrast within that

00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:27,820
slide if you would have flip it the

00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:30,220
other way around you might have people

00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:32,470
putting way too much information on this

00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:34,900
slide and then highlighting things and

00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:38,850
only dense you realize well actually the

00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:42,060
stuff on here could be condensed so I

00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:45,520
put them in this order because I think

00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:47,440
it's the best way to approach it when

00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:50,500
you're thinking about slide design so

00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:53,260
even if you you know let's say you're

00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:56,110
gonna make a new slide deck next week

00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:58,450
and you talk and you don't want to try

00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:59,860
to stack a little down than one go start

00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:02,380
with the first one because that will

00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:05,800
have the most effects on your slides

00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:07,870
then for the next one start would grab

00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,089
the next principle so that's the way I

00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:14,750
kind of structured that

00:48:10,089 --> 00:48:18,580
yeah so I have a couple of questions

00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:22,520
coming in from from the ether pad and

00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:25,640
both Gabriel in Hungary and Kalyan and

00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:28,280
India would like to know if you have any

00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:32,750
recommended best practices for showing

00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:37,130
code or live coding doing demos within a

00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:41,810
presentation so for the first one for

00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:44,450
sharing code I think one of the things I

00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:47,480
like to do is start out with the most

00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:52,910
simple bit of code first and then build

00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:55,130
on top of that even if you end up with

00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:59,690
so one of the things that you can do is

00:48:55,130 --> 00:49:03,170
like add more and more code each time

00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:04,280
but gray outs kind of the the older code

00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:07,250
are you doing so you're only

00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:08,810
highlighting the new bits of code so

00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:10,849
just making sure again that people

00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:14,060
aren't overwhelmed by having too much

00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:17,690
text on the same at the same time on the

00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:21,200
slide so that's one thing that I like

00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:22,940
doing then I guess make sure that you

00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,839
have a readable forms so make sure that

00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:28,490
whatever type of code you want to show

00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:31,580
looks right or your slide don't just you

00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:34,430
know take a screen grab from your editor

00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:39,200
and just tuck it in there actually take

00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:45,460
time to kind of use different fonts and

00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:45,460
different colors to have the best yeah

00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:53,300
make it stand out in the way that you

00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:55,990
want in regards to live demos I haven't

00:49:53,300 --> 00:50:00,200
done live demos with code myself

00:49:55,990 --> 00:50:03,200
actually what I have noticed that some

00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:09,380
people tend to do is record yourself

00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:11,480
doing writing some actual code and then

00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:13,160
put the video into your presentation or

00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:17,270
turn it into a gif

00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:20,660
sometimes there's no reason why why you

00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:21,490
need to be demoing life so really think

00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:24,850
about what is

00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:26,590
purpose of you doing nuts is it justice

00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:28,750
showed you're an awesome programmer that

00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:32,320
you can actually code life on stage or

00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:37,480
is it about showing an actual example to

00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:39,700
people so yeah it kind of depends again

00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:44,980
like what is it that you're trying to

00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:46,930
teach your audience yeah let me take one

00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:49,060
more from the etherpad and then we'll go

00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:52,750
back to the room and start wrapping it

00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:55,300
up so Gloria in Greece wants to know

00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:58,180
when it comes to using color contrast

00:50:55,300 --> 00:51:00,760
are there any specific palettes that you

00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:05,380
know of that can work with possible

00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:08,650
colorblindness issues um so that's tough

00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:13,360
questions yes to be honest that's one

00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:17,260
area that I know I'm I I'm not very good

00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:22,750
I think I I'm aware of it and I should

00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:23,920
be better at it but I can't quite

00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:26,830
remember right now but there are a

00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:30,100
couple of websites that will help you

00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:32,260
with understanding color contrast for

00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:38,470
accessibility reasons and kind of what

00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:39,850
is the best way to to visualize that I

00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:42,580
know there are a couple of browser

00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:45,010
plugins that you can use to make sure

00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:49,030
that the color contrast that you have is

00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:50,890
is readable enough but yeah that's

00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:52,060
definitely so something to keep in mind

00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:55,619
when you're you're choosing your

00:51:52,060 --> 00:52:01,180
palettes of how that might look

00:51:55,619 --> 00:52:03,720
yeah I think we had one in the room so

00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:05,410
let's go with that one

00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,450
thanks Bonita

00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:09,609
actually just one question just want to

00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:11,740
know like because we're like send us we

00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:14,200
have to put a lot of trust in this life

00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:16,990
do you have any recommendations for like

00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:26,920
that's a visual display of charts on the

00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:28,869
slide for charts yes so remember I've

00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:31,630
got a I've got a post-it note on my

00:52:28,869 --> 00:52:32,520
screen right now which has a website

00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:37,480
link

00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:40,510
to a this is one website which has a

00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:42,400
huge collection of different charts and

00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:46,180
graphs that we can use but also explains

00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:48,640
for what type of information those

00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:52,930
charts are useful for so you can really

00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:56,020
get an idea of what are the different

00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:58,180
types of graphs that are out there and

00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:01,330
is it the best way to show my

00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:07,210
information I just can't remember how

00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:11,670
it's cold anymore I I will look that up

00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:17,350
and share it with people afterwards yeah

00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:19,600
thank you so I'm gonna take one more

00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:22,720
question from the ether planet and then

00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:24,460
we'll call it an evening although to

00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:27,250
tell you the truth we could probably

00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:28,900
spend another hour talking about

00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:30,910
questions on the ether pad but I think

00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:33,730
some of them have actually been covered

00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:36,850
in your talk so folks who are listening

00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:38,740
to the live stream go back and watch

00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:41,080
this or wait until we've posted a

00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:43,110
transcript and scanned the transcript

00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:46,840
and you'll get some of those answers and

00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:51,490
there was a question about from Rob inba

00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:53,940
about using serif versus non serif fonts

00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:56,530
and do you have an opinion or

00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:59,970
recommendation on that he says I noticed

00:53:56,530 --> 00:54:04,300
you use serif I always use non San serif

00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:14,050
for projected slides and has so I

00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:18,250
actually use both I think yeah cuz my

00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:21,490
normal the majority of my slides has one

00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:25,840
and then the design failure was I I

00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:29,290
don't have a preference either way I

00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:33,820
think it depends on you as a presenter

00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:36,940
which one fits for you I would suggest

00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:40,810
like avoiding like really really cursive

00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:43,950
type of phones because those can to be

00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:47,369
quite tricky to read but other than that

00:54:43,950 --> 00:55:31,140
I don't necessarily think yeah there's a

00:54:47,369 --> 00:55:33,240
massive difference between them yeah

00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:36,180
it's more like I've seen both applied

00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:38,250
insights well it just depends what

00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:44,760
you're trying to get across with the

00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:46,859
slide keeping that in mind I guess so we

00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:50,310
like I said we could go on for a long

00:55:46,859 --> 00:55:52,890
time but out of consideration for the

00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:56,430
speaker and the folks in the room thank

00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:59,730
you so much for coming I will share the

00:55:56,430 --> 00:56:01,680
link to with however this list is

00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:05,099
created there will be a link I will

00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:07,640
tweet the link to the recording when it

00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:09,869
becomes transcoded and available and

00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:12,869
thanks a million for coming out and

00:56:09,869 --> 00:56:14,060
