hi my name is Andrew Garcia and I'm a

00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,970
Mozilla tag speaker in this video series

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,849
we are going to dive deep into Firefox

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,460
add-on development but before we can

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,470
start like coding like Matt we should

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,590
take a few steps back and think about

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:23,840
what are atoms themselves and why they

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:27,180
are crucial to a health web echo system

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:31,109
many of us like web developers don't

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:34,200
realize that we face a dilemma if we if

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:37,770
you allow me a poor metaphor think of us

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,530
like restaurant chefs where we go to a

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,920
restaurant to work and we do lots of

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:47,340
cooking there but we never eat that food

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,430
and when we go home we eat food that was

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,100
not prepared by us we web developers are

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,260
like chefs that never eat their own food

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,149
you might be working for this big

00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,850
corporation doing this fancy product

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,949
that you don't actually use and when you

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,580
go home you end up using products that

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:08,280
you never made it's a tricky thing like

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:13,140
wonder when it was the last time that

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:15,090
you used software that you built a mean

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,810
of us on our day to day lives don't do

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:21,210
that and I'm yet to find a restaurant

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:26,729
chef that doesn't cook his own food

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:30,360
never so with that in mind let's think

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:33,680
about why that happens people tend to

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,840
divide users into like two groups

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,479
developers and end users and we tend to

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,659
shift between those groups as our day

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,040
goes by we might be developers at job or

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,890
might be actually developing something

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,619
for our own use but other times you are

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,500
just users note that one thing is better

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:56,040
than the other they are not but there is

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,829
like a space between that is filled by

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:02,700
another concept I first met this concept

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:05,460
on a book from the early 2000s by Dan

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:09,119
Shafer he coined this term inventive

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,310
user the inventive user is someone that

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,960
knows that they can like develop

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,840
software to solve their own problem

00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,940
but they don't have like recent formal

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,880
training and they are not employed as

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:24,750
full-time developers it's people that

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,850
you know like end up with a system to

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,430
manage their restaurant made with Excel

00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,530
and things like that and I think that

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,500
this is an important concept of solving

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,950
your own problems of having agency over

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,870
your online life where you pick at your

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,070
own hands and you go like hey you know

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,630
I'm going to fix that

00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:49,620
Adams allows us to solve our own

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:53,340
problems because let's face it there is

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:56,400
a very very very slight chance that

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:59,160
those large tech companies will listen

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,950
to you or I when we want a feature like

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,440
oh I don't like square buttons I want

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,240
round buttons they will not update their

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,750
own product just because you like round

00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:13,380
buttons but with add-ons you can pick

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:17,220
your desire on how that platform works

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,960
and you can fix that for you and then

00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,620
share it with others and fix it for

00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:25,080
others another important way to think

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,410
about that ons is that they allow you to

00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,470
take some control of your life back of

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:34,550
your online life at least these days

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:37,320
with like state-sponsored P&R and

00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:40,740
unethical profiling for advertising

00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:43,260
purposes there is a lot going online

00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:46,590
that you didn't really sign it up for

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:49,470
and you might not even agree advances

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:52,710
allow us to pull back on this type of

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:56,340
war so what what we think the internet

00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:59,820
should be from tracking protection to ad

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,940
blocking to lots of different stuff for

00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:07,890
example add ons that create a safe space

00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:10,470
by filtering sensitive content this

00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:14,490
allows you on this perpetual tug of war

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:16,920
between companies and ourselves it

00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:19,859
allows us an extra full of strength

00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:24,630
towards what we want our online

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:26,880
experience to be add-ons are in essence

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,430
like a rebellious Act

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,770
you are basically looking at something

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,840
that was made and saying I want to

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,150
interfere with that because I think I

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,759
can do better I want a different

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,289
experience and I'm holding destiny in my

00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,199
hand and I'm going to install this

00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:47,130
add-on or develop this add-on to have

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,680
the experience I want so let's just

00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:54,180
summarize that add-ons are important

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,660
because they provide a necessary force

00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:01,400
on your online experience the browser's

00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:05,460
are called user agents and add-ons are

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:09,659
the two of user agents that allow you to

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:12,539
mold your own online experience I hope

00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:14,849
you join me next week as we analyze the

00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:18,360
anatomy of web extensions and finally

00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:20,370
build our first excitation on the

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,590
description below you will find a link

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,080
to a playlist that will contain all

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,539
those videos and feel free to reach me

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,699
the contact information is down below in

00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:32,039
the description as well I'm eager to

00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:34,409
learn more about like feedback and the

00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:36,680
kind of content that you want to see see

00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:36,680
