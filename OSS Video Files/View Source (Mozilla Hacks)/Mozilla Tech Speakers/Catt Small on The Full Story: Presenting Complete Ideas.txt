- Okay.

00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:21,621
(background chatter)

00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:23,289
Hey everybody.

00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:27,761
Welcome to the 2nd Tech Speakers master class

00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,330
of Winter 2017.

00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:35,668
It's my great pleasure today to introduce Catt Small

00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:39,339
who will be presenting, The Full Story: Presenting

00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:40,874
Complete Ideas.

00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:44,544
Catt is a product designer, developer, and game developer

00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,648
at Etsy where she makes awesome things.

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,853
She's been programming interactive games

00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:58,691
since about age 10 and continues ever since.

00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:02,095
In her spare time she works with, Good for People of Color

00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:05,198
and launches games with Brooklyn Gamery.

00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,535
Without further ado, Catt Small, thank you.

00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:11,371
(applause)

00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,872
- Thank you.

00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:16,009
Hello, yeah, hi internet people.

00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,979
So I'm here today to talk about how and why

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,949
it's good to use storytelling in your presentations.

00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:25,452
So we're going to be talking about storytelling

00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:28,788
as a concept as well as how to use storytelling

00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:31,724
within your presentations to make better

00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:34,294
and more engaging talks.

00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:37,430
But first, just kind of getting a little more context

00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,134
about where I'm coming from so Javi did a great job

00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,803
of introducing me in terms of what I do.

00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:46,339
I'm a product designer at Etsy which is a website

00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:49,476
that lets people buy unique goods from around the world.

00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,678
And I mostly focus on the payments experience

00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,347
for sellers by helping them to understand

00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:57,150
the payments that they are receiving and also to update

00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,085
their payment preferences.

00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,488
I am also a co-founder of Brooklyn Gamery

00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,324
where we make endearing and weird video games

00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,526
and organize diversity of focused events

00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,528
like the Game Devs of Color Expo.

00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,464
And I also make my own random things like games,

00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,733
apps, websites, and comics.

00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:18,004
I've spoken at various events including TEDx,

00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:21,107
Beyond Tellerrand, which is a cutting edge

00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,942
technology conference in Berlin

00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:26,146
which happens in both DÃ¼sseldorf and Berlin.

00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,983
And AIGA Design conference which is a conference

00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,052
for designers of all kinds including print designers

00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:37,423
as well as user experience designers like myself.

00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:40,160
At these different places, I've spoken about

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,029
many different topics because often the conferences

00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,931
don't have very much in common.

00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,633
Sometimes they're about technology,

00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,102
sometimes they're about programming, design,

00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,971
life experience, and so I've had to kind of shake it up

00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:56,209
a little bit and talk about lots of different things.

00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,179
But all of these different talks that I've done

00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,582
have a singular thing in common, at the very least.

00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,918
And that is telling stories.

00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,988
So, just to give a brief definition

00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,057
so that we're all on the same page

00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:13,660
about what storytelling is,

00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,095
I'm going to be referring to it as

00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:19,899
the social and cultural activity of sharing stories

00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,602
and that comes from Wikipedia so,

00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,939
just to kind of breakdown what exactly that means,

00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,840
we've got these three different components

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,275
that make up a story.

00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,512
We've got plot, we have characters, and point of view.

00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,014
And all of these come together to tell an overarching

00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:38,051
narrative that hopefully guides you,

00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:42,522
or guides listeners through the process of your talk.

00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,191
So breaking those down and defining those a little bit,

00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,227
the plot refers to the sequence of events

00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,461
that happen in a story.

00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,597
And a story can be long or short.

00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,933
And it can involve many or a few events.

00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,837
Additionally, characters are the beings who exist

00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:01,241
within the story and by beings I mean any objects

00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:05,445
that have agency or personality, they affect or are affected

00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,881
by the plot that's happening, so for example,

00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,184
you can have beings who are animals or people

00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,954
or even objects that have been given life, for example,

00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,056
a clicky thing like this.

00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,693
And then finally you have the point of view

00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,729
which is the perspective of the narrator.

00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,831
So, in this case it's me because I'm sharing

00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,467
this presentation with you and I'm telling the story

00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,203
in the way that seems best to me.

00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,674
In terms of why storytelling is important

00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,110
and why it matters and why we should all think about ways

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,879
to tell stories with our talks.

00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,782
Firstly, people engage much more, it's more engaging

00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,250
for your listeners.

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,352
So what I mean by that is that,

00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,821
from childhood we've been primed to listen

00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:51,424
to stories, we've got fairytales that we've been told

00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:52,692
since we were young.

00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,862
These are all ways that we were communicated to,

00:04:55,862 --> 00:05:00,033
we were, people shared morals and learnings through stories.

00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,004
Additionally, people really, really like the process

00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,939
of a story moving from start to finish.

00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,509
They love the beginning, the middle, the end,

00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,377
they want to know what happens next.

00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:14,013
And how it ends, as I said, so, and even when you know

00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,983
how the story ends, if you see the ending at the beginning,

00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,452
you want to understand, well how did it get there,

00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:23,356
so people just really love stories.

00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,660
They also relate more when they're hearing stories

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,396
because a lot of people put themselves in the shoes

00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,665
of the characters in those stories and say,

00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,867
oh, this could have happened to me,

00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:38,071
so they start to feel a sense of compassion for the narrator

00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:41,307
as well as the characters in the story.

00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,211
And additionally, stories make you feel like an interesting

00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:49,048
human being and obviously we're all real people,

00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:52,652
but it's about communicating your experiences

00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:53,986
to other people.

00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,122
Or communicating the experiences of others to others.

00:05:56,122 --> 00:06:00,159
And I really highlight this because when I was younger

00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:03,563
I used to be quite bad at storytelling and sharing

00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,466
my experiences with other people and I found

00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,335
that the most relatable people were those

00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,338
who told stories more and shared more of the things

00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,340
that they were learning with others.

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,476
And it was because they were vulnerable,

00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,678
they were funny, they were engaging,

00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,880
and people really liked that.

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,216
So now I make a conscious effort to,

00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,818
within my presentations but also within my actual

00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:29,088
regular day to day life, just make sure that I share

00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,190
more stories with people.

00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:36,195
Thirdly, people understand more when you do stories.

00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,865
And this is actually a thing that has been studied.

00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,167
So, for example, Marilee "Brain Lady" Sprenger

00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:44,237
wrote an entire piece about this and did several studies

00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,306
on this and people actually process information

00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:48,307
better when,

00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,546
when stories are told to them, basically.

00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,115
And I'm not going to read the entire thing,

00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:59,018
but basically our brains compare existing experiences

00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,621
that they've had with new stories that they learn

00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,257
and things that are related to their own personal

00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,894
experiences can actually processed more easily.

00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,196
Which means that stories are more likely to be relatable

00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:13,933
to existing experiences that people have had

00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,469
or even fears and concerns that people have thought

00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,870
about before.

00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,440
So, for example, if something happens to one person

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,442
and someone says, oh, my god, I was afraid that that thing

00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,177
was going to happen forever.

00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:27,280
Well, now they know exactly where that,

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,182
what the result of that is and they also are very likely

00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,452
to remember possibly the presentation that someone

00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,687
conveyed that story within.

00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,724
And there's two different ways to do this.

00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,594
So firstly, you can use analogies which are kind of like

00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,863
short little tidbits that are hopefully related

00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,899
to down to earth things that can be used

00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,969
to explain ideas that are hard to understand.

00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,305
For example, when I was younger,

00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,041
learning to, learning Java Script,

00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,376
how to program Java Script, I found it really useful

00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:01,080
to think about functions as in teaching a dog to fetch

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,851
and that was because when you teach a dog something

00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,553
for the first time, usually they are able

00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,589
to then just execute upon it repeatedly

00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,023
after the first time that you teach it.

00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,959
And obviously it's not a direct correlation

00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,230
but it helps people understand, these kinds of complex

00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,199
things that are maybe kind of scary at first

00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,935
and it makes it more relatable and more friendly

00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,437
and hopefully it will add a more positive way

00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,772
to actually remember this concept that might be scary

00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,107
for some people.

00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:32,345
And large, more personal stories can also be used

00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,181
to explain these larger concepts.

00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,884
For example, how do you use different processes

00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,720
in the workplace or any other thing that maybe

00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,922
requires a little bit more depth.

00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,892
So, you can use these larger stories not analogies

00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,494
to kind of talk about these more concept,

00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,930
or complex things rather.

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,267
So for example, by talking about a personal failure

00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,236
or frustration or even a way that you succeeded,

00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:00,306
you can transfer your experiences into other people's

00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,042
success and they, and people really appreciate

00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,845
the opportunity to learn from mistakes

00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,714
and from other people's experiences because,

00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,584
especially, for example, me, I'm like in front

00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:15,421
of y'all right now and maybe a I seem like everthings

00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,457
going great, but we've all had our ups and downs

00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,694
and it's very useful to kind of use the platform

00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,729
that I'm using right now, for example,

00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,998
to share the learnings that got me to this point,

00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,267
which is why I'm really happy to be here right now,

00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,302
so thank you.

00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,938
(laughs)

00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,740
So, continuing on, people remember more

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,842
when you share stories.

00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,445
And I mentioned this before with the entire part

00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:43,816
about being a little more relatable, but that's again

00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:47,954
related to the brain really enjoying beginnings,

00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,522
middles, and ends.

00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,757
Our brains really like to process things

00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,326
in the story format.

00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,561
And that's probably why I don't like shows that never end

00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,330
for example, The Simpson's.

00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,033
I need a finish, everyone needs like a finished package,

00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,502
they need a beginning, they need a middle, they need an end

00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:07,206
and our brain just really likes that.

00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:10,142
So, now that you know what storytelling

00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,612
is within the realm of this talk and why it's

00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,947
super useful for conveying the concepts

00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,350
that you're trying to share with people

00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,485
during presentations, here's a little bit

00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,121
about how to put that extra awesome sparkle

00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,224
into your future talks by using storytelling.

00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,859
And I'm going to be going through

00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:29,061
my entire process from the beginning

00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,030
to the almost finished product.

00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,965
I'm not going to get too much into

00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,200
the presentation building part

00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,635
because it's about designing the content

00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,438
before you actually build the presentation.

00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,240
So, firstly, I'm going to point something out,

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,476
and I've kind of mentioned this a little bit before,

00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,278
but when you are designing a talk,

00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,247
kind of like stories in general,

00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,583
you have the overarching plot,

00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,785
and then you have the sub-stories

00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,987
or the minor plot points that make up

00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,024
the entire concept that you're trying to drive home.

00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,359
So, when I'm talking about these different things,

00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,129
I'm going to talk about creating the overarching story,

00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,965
and then I'm also going to talk about opportunities

00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,300
to actually drive home the points in your talk

00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,936
using these sub-stories as I will sometimes refer to them.

00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:13,973
So, let's start.

00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:18,144
So, firstly, when I am identifying a talk idea,

00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,647
I usually like to start by flushing it out

00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,349
by writing an abstract.

00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,318
So, what that means is, I'm writing a summary

00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:29,155
of the speech or the presentation that I'm going to give.

00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,923
And this is great because this is usually

00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,359
what conferences ask for anyway,

00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:37,063
so it's really convenient to send them this

00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,498
piece of information, or maybe you'll have an idea

00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:42,334
and they will just ask you for an abstract anyway.

00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:45,604
But when you're actually doing a proposal,

00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,707
they're usually going to ask for this abstract,

00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,543
so it's great to have this written up anyway.

00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,178
So, I usually answer questions like,

00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:55,047
what is the talk about, what are you trying to solve,

00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,282
what will attendees learn?

00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,583
And the last one is really important

00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,385
because that's what is gonna actually

00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,388
drive people to your talk and also for conference

00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,557
organizers, that's what they're actually

00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,692
going to look for anyway, so you want to make sure

00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,528
that you've identified the talk's audience

00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,765
and made it attractive in some way, hopefully.

00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,367
Like, everyone's biased, so attractive

00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:18,070
is kind of a weird phrase, but you want to make sure

00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,339
that you're thinking about your end users,

00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,542
which, in this case, is your audience.

00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,178
And then once I've written this abstract,

00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,848
what I do next is, I usually just either start

00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:32,184
with a blank piece of paper or I will go

00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,321
into a word processing program like Microsoft Word

00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,023
or Google Docs, and I just start mind mapping,

00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,559
which is the process of writing down

00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,927
lots of related ideas to the initial idea

00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,863
that came into your head.

00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,165
So, for example, in terms of this talk

00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,734
that I did called, designing socially impactful experiences,

00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,537
I started to write a bunch of things down, like,

00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:54,140
oh, this is how technology succeeds,

00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,643
this is how it fails, this idea of humility,

00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,445
how do I create a project for good,

00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,681
how has technology been used as a silver bullet

00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:07,186
to kind of solve all problems, and things like that.

00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,955
And then once I just kind of wrote everything down,

00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,258
I start to organize it into a structure

00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,393
that makes a little bit more sense.

00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,462
And this becomes the high level outline

00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,331
that provides the overall direction for my talk.

00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,433
So, taking the previous slide and, sort of,

00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,303
organizing these pieces of information into sections,

00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,338
you can have the overarching idea

00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,308
of designing socially impactful experiences,

00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,343
but then there's one section about

00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:34,480
how technology has been used in the past,

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,448
and how it's failed and succeeded

00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,384
as this idea of a silver bullet

00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,352
that kind of solves all problems,

00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,087
and then you can also have a section

00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,657
that's more about how to create a project for good

00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,493
with the idea of humility in mind.

00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,796
And then once I've actually kind of organized

00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:54,366
that stuff a little bit, I transferred that outline

00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,002
into a writing program, if I wasn't already using one,

00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,572
like Word for example, and then I start

00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,708
adding these time budgets or buckets

00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,477
to each section, and what that does is helps me

00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:09,014
to figure out how much to talk about each part

00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,283
of my presentation, it also helps me figure out

00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,953
how many slides I'm probably going to have to make,

00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,288
and it helps me remember how much time I have overall,

00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:19,091
because it's very, very, easy to go over

00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,060
or go under if you don't start thinking

00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,063
about the time you're going to need pretty early.

00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,665
And then I actually start filling out these sections

00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,601
more once I've figured out how much time

00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,003
I can actually give to each part,

00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,105
and what this does is allow me to start really,

00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:35,574
again, thinking about the design of the content

00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,810
before I get into the presentation,

00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,113
and that's how I actually did this entire presentation

00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,816
that I'm doing for you right now.

00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,652
And then once I've kind of done this brain dump

00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,654
and organized it all and written it up,

00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,190
I start thinking about spots where I can actually

00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,192
introduce these sub-stories.

00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,227
So, at this point, I've got the overall story,

00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,196
I know the plot, but I need to figure out,

00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:00,132
well, how can I use these real things

00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,600
that have possibly happened to me

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,435
or to other people to actually drive home

00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,337
the points in my story?

00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,974
So, for example, a time when something didn't work out,

00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,343
which is the first section that I bolded,

00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,746
or a time when it did, and a project that I worked on

00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,347
and what I learned.

00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,484
And then I just start adding them in

00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,653
into the spots where it makes sense,

00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,922
and after this is when I usually start to actually

00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:27,026
create the presentation, and as I mentioned,

00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,862
this is what I used for my talk and many others,

00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,431
and also, terrible mysql jokes are, sorry.

00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,033
(laughing)

00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:37,436
Okay, so, now that you know how I work,

00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,171
I wanted to also talk about some

00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,806
lessons that I learned, and some of these,

00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:44,209
as I mentioned, will apply to the overall idea

00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,245
of creating a story with your talk,

00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,782
like creating a plot-driven, sort of, presentation,

00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:54,753
and some of these will just apply to sub-story creation.

00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,122
So, firstly, you want your stories

00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,224
to be simple, so this presentation

00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:03,028
is pretty straightforward, it's got different parts to it,

00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,764
but it's really driving home a singular idea,

00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,901
and I did that on purpose, because it's easier

00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,503
for people to follow and it's more concise

00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:14,306
when you're not throwing too many things at people,

00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,208
because they're gonna lose interest,

00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,043
they're gonna be kind of confused,

00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,878
and people can't process a ton of information at once,

00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:22,681
especially not when you're talking to them

00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:25,117
for maybe 30 to 45 minutes.

00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:28,153
They've got a certain amount of things they can understand,

00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,989
and you have to make sure that you're not

00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,991
presenting too many concepts, otherwise they're

00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,126
not really gonna be able to remember all of it.

00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,161
So, make sure that your core idea is the one

00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,163
that you're kind of hammering home

00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,232
and talking about it as much as you can,

00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,234
and everything that you're presenting is backing

00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,569
up that concept.

00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,740
Secondly, stories should be in low quantity.

00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,975
So, what that means is, in terms

00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,244
of the overall presentation, again,

00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,813
you're using, hopefully you're not making it too complex,

00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:57,950
but then sub-stories are one of many different techniques,

00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,452
so, me talking about an experience that I've had

00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:03,589
is one part of this presentation, but I

00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,824
also use things like statements,

00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,292
so I'm stating different things,

00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,461
I'm quoting research for example,

00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,663
maybe I can ask an audience question,

00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:14,466
which I'm not doing, but I could also do things

00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:17,636
like a joke, for example, and that's another thing.

00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,772
But if you're overusing any of these techniques,

00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,574
then people are going to recognize them more often,

00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,743
and now you probably all know when I'm going

00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:28,380
to tell a story, but it's a lot easier

00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,182
when you're presenting about something

00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:33,919
that's not public speaking or not presentation techniques.

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,488
And if they start to notice that you're using

00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,957
these techniques and it doesn't feel natural,

00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,292
then they're going to be distracted,

00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:43,028
and using storytelling as a technique

00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,863
is not going to be beneficial to you.

00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,598
So, just make sure that you're thinking

00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,100
about the content of your talk

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,968
and seeing, like, oh, is this story

00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,804
actually necessary in the spot where it is

00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,572
or am I just trying too hard to throw

00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,907
these things in?

00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,210
Thirdly, you want to make sure that stories

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,379
that you're telling are relevant.

00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:03,415
So, in terms of the overall concept

00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,117
that you're trying to deliver,

00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,586
ensure that it's relevant for the time period

00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,688
it is in, for example, and it's relevant

00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,790
for the audience that it's being spoken to.

00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,060
So, for example, talking about user experience design

00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,664
now is different from 2012, and I have to think about

00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,933
when I'm doing UX design presentations,

00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,368
how things have changed and how I can adapt

00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:27,639
my presentation to the current time that it lives within.

00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,942
And then in terms of those sub-stories

00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,212
that I'm creating to drive home my concept,

00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:36,381
I need to make sure that they actually do that,

00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,484
that they're relevant, and that they're

00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,319
comprehensible for the audience,

00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,354
that the audience can understand them, basically.

00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:45,390
And I want to make sure that people who don't know me

00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,926
understand what I'm trying to present

00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,963
and they find the story relevant, so,

00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,499
one way I usually do that is by actually

00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,400
sitting with a bunch of people,

00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,069
sometimes it's people I know well,

00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,138
sometimes it's co-workers, for example,

00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,040
sometimes I don't even ask them to sit in front of me,

00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,143
sometimes I just let them go through

00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,544
my presentation with the notes

00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:06,778
that I'm going to talk about,

00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,013
and I find that very helpful,

00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,882
because then they can look at it and say,

00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,817
oh, well, I don't understand the point

00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,519
that you're trying to convey, I don't

00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,454
understand how this piece of information

00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,122
you're sharing is relevant to the talk

00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:20,025
that you're trying to give overall.

00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,663
And then fourthly, stories should be down-to-earth.

00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,198
So, what that means is, again,

00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:27,933
you want relatable, human,

00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,968
you want people to remember that you're a human being

00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,937
with feelings and emotions and experiences

00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,139
that got you to where you are.

00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,276
So, try not to stay in the high, fancy castle,

00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,811
get comfortable laughing at yourself,

00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,547
share times when you've succeeded,

00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,315
but also times when you failed,

00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,384
because lessons about success and failure

00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,920
are equally useful, for example,

00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,191
one person at a talk that I attended at Beyond Tellerrand,

00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,092
described this time where he thought

00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,361
he had a heart attack, and kind of wrapped it

00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,564
around this concept of appreciating life

00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:02,834
and paying attention to just being alive a little bit more

00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,870
and kind of taking risks.

00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,572
And I thought it was very interesting,

00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,140
because I'm talking about right now,

00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,942
I still remember it, it really impacted me.

00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,678
I definitely recommend checking out

00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:16,715
the Beyond Tellerrand talks from like last year.

00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,217
They were really, really interesting.

00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:22,054
So, see how you can kind of pull in these like life

00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,924
experiences that maybe don't seem very cool.

00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:29,027
Or like, make you seem like a more vulnerable person

00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:33,065
because again, they just make you seem and feel

00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,835
more genuine and relatable and down to earth.

00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,504
And then finally, stories should be easy to recall,

00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,707
so just like I did with this person who thought

00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,109
they had a heart attack, it takes five seconds

00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,078
to talk about what that is.

00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,847
You want to make sure that you're conveying your ideas

00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,115
more effectively.

00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,818
I remember, you know, about appreciating life

00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,953
from this presentation this person did

00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,922
because he talked about a heart attack

00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,657
and that's a very real relatable thing.

00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,193
I can remember it very easily and if the listeners

00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,462
don't remember the idea that you were sharing,

00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:07,099
they can't attach that concept to the story that

00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,068
you were telling, then you need to figure out a way

00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,536
to make that happen.

00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,772
You have to work on that, improve that technique

00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,774
and ensure that when you're telling these stories

00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,443
they're being attached correctly to the idea

00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,446
that you're trying to say to people.

00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:26,151
So I'm just going to do some wrap up and then I will

00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:29,254
share the assignment for this week.

00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:32,958
I believe it's a week and so in summary,

00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,694
as I mentioned storytelling is a very useful way

00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:38,697
to make your presentation more engaging.

00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,766
Hopefully you enjoyed me talking at you

00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,768
for about half an hour.

00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,637
Listeners also remember stories more

00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,140
because they have a beginning, they have a middle,

00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,042
they have an end and hopefully you can even,

00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,277
when you're creating your presentation,

00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,979
now that you have this idea of the order things

00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,248
are going to go in, you can actually prepare people,

00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:59,584
up front, to actually to know how that presentation's

00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:00,886
going to go.

00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:03,221
And that's just as a side note, I found it

00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,790
quite useful to, once I've gotten an idea

00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,092
of the order that my talk is going to go in,

00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,428
actually tell them up front, this is what we're going

00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:11,396
to talk about today, which is why I did that

00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:14,766
and that's because people really like having a little bit

00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,635
of predictability and a little bit of surprise

00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,070
at the same time.

00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:22,207
So, see if you can kind of utilize this process

00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:25,711
of designing your content and then figuring out

00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,879
how to organize it into a way that's palatable

00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:30,315
for people, easy to understand, and then present it

00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,684
to them up front so they know how it's possibly

00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,686
going to end, but then again, it's the process

00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,422
of going through the entire experience.

00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,391
And then again, people relate more to stories

00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:40,959
because they feel down to earth,

00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,662
they feel familiar, it's things that people may have

00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,864
experienced before or things that people

00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:49,835
were scared might actually happen and both of those

00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:53,739
provide easier learning lessons for people.

00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,908
And then some advice for, again, designing your talks.

00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:59,344
I always suggest outlining first before jumping

00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:01,146
into presentation design.

00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,215
I'm a designer, it's really easy to get stuck

00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:07,285
making things look nice, but design is a science,

00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:11,656
so again, not art, but I always suggest outlining first

00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,493
because you want to make sure that your content

00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:17,696
is going to be easy to process and understand.

00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,965
And then you can actually jump into making it look

00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,466
really cool.

00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,835
When you have both, people really appreciate that.

00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:27,038
Think about your audience, make sure that you're considering

00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,107
what's going to be useful for them.

00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:30,842
That the content you're trying to share

00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,578
is going to be something that's relevant and related

00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,214
to the rest of the idea that you're trying to share.

00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:38,683
And that it's delivered at a level that's comfortable

00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:41,353
for them, so like make sure that if your audience

00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:44,689
is going to be more advanced, you can kind of figure

00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,125
out ways to communicate stuff without as many analogies

00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,126
for example.

00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:52,764
And then make sure that the sub-stories that kind

00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,399
of drive your plot are again relatable, simple,

00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:57,169
and on topic.

00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:01,373
So, moving onto the assignment, I would like everyone

00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,175
to start telling stories.

00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,676
Yeah!

00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:08,113
So, what you're going to do is, I'm going to share a link

00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,248
to the public speaking worksheets, I've already given

00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,217
it to Javi, so she's got that there.

00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,286
If you can't access the printer, you can just use regular

00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,054
paper for all of these things.

00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,289
That's why it's nice.

00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,024
They're worksheets are just a really extra nice

00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:22,227
structure for you, but you can also just do it on

00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,728
your own.

00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:24,996
Whatever works for you is really the thing to do.

00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,666
So, ideally you want to start by,

00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,335
once you've identified your idea and if you haven't,

00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:33,038
there's a whole extra section for that.

00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,440
But what you want to do is you want to write four versions

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,609
of an abstract so that's just a process of editing.

00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,212
You've got your initial idea and then what you'll do

00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:43,148
is kind of hone in on it until you feel really comfortable

00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,116
by that 4th version that you've created.

00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:48,620
And then what you're going to do is use the worksheets

00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,523
again to kind of do mind mapping and identify

00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,860
some sub-topics that you would want to share in that talk.

00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,696
And then what you're going to do is cut those out

00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:00,131
so if you do actually print the worksheets out,

00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,267
it's really fun because you get to do some arts and crafts

00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,236
which I really personally like a lot.

00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:07,706
And then you can organize them physically in front of you

00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,108
into an outline, but if you use paper or something

00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:12,244
else, just rewrite it or just copy and paste

00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,979
until things look good.

00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:16,381
And then you're going to, if you haven't already,

00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,617
transfer that outline to a writing app

00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,886
like Word or Docs or whatever you like.

00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,554
Pages also is great.

00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:26,091
And then you can expand upon that outline

00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:27,893
and add stories from your experience.

00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,661
So really start building that out.

00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,863
And then you will create a basic presentation.

00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,733
You can use a generic template in any of those programs

00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:38,603
to convey your idea, but really just see how you can use

00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:42,741
your outline and design it first and then see how that

00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:46,778
affects the actual presentation that comes out

00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:50,215
of the work that you do.

00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,584
So, that's pretty much everything that I have

00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:53,818
for today.

00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:56,855
Hopefully you all found it useful and helpful

00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,424
for the future of your presentation work.

00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:02,294
Thank you so much and if you have any questions,

00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:04,629
feel free to ask now or can send me a Tweet

00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:06,598
or an email, I'm available on all

00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,668
of these different things, so, thank you.

00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,903
(applause)

00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,345
- [Male Aide] Testing, testing, all right, great.

00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,313
Thank you so much, Catt.

00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,547
It was absolutely wonderful.

00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,049
We do have some questions in fact.

00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,084
First I would like to ask if we have any questions

00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,085
in the room.

00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:33,325
Did we have a question on this other end?

00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,259
No.

00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,727
- [Catt] I think we're chill.

00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:36,528
- All right, we'll go ahead and take some questions

00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:37,896
from offline then.

00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,732
All right, Catt, can you recommend some talks

00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,867
to watch that are great examples of using

00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:43,935
storytelling?

00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,170
- [Catt] Ew, yes.

00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,572
So, as I mentioned, the Beyond Tellerrand,

00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:51,543
DÃ¼sseldorf from 2016 had a lot of really great

00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,244
presentations to watch.

00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:56,681
I'm trying to think of the actual names

00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:58,783
of some of the presenters but I would suggest

00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,585
going on Beyond Tellerrand's,

00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:04,656
It's T-E-L-L-E-R-R-A-N-D.

00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,325
If you look at, they have a Vimeo account

00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,728
and they have all of the talks from last year

00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:12,230
up there and there are a lot of really great storytellers

00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,934
including the final keynote talk who was by a person

00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:19,004
who talked about designing this incredibly weird

00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,539
Kickstarter book.

00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,075
I guess he like sends out a lot of these insulting

00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:26,611
illustrations to people just randomly.

00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:28,847
They pay him to do that and then he sends them

00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:31,149
these weird, rude, insulting illustrations

00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,585
and he talked about the process of turning that

00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:36,488
into this music video that he did.

00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,223
And I found that to be really cool.

00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,858
They have a bunch of other things like that,

00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,993
where it was like this person who made glass self-driving

00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,129
car that looked really pretty.

00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:47,198
So there's a lot of these talks at Beyond Tellerrand

00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:48,867
and are super interesting.

00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,436
AIGA Design Conference also had some really good talks

00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:54,072
but I'm not sure when they're going to release them online.

00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,974
That's the only frustrating part is like,

00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:59,844
sometimes finding the actual presentations on the internet

00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,714
can be challenging but the nice thing is that

00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:06,885
BT Conference has already done that and I know that,

00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:11,723
Bang Bang Con is also pretty good.

00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,526
Like a lot of their presentations are also quite great

00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,728
and I definitely suggest watching some of their work.

00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,731
- [Male Aide] Great, thanks so much.

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,234
Another question from offline.

00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,737
Are you familiar with the pyramid principle?

00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,872
And if so, what are your thoughts about using it

00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,108
to structure your outlines and abstracts?

00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,644
- [Catt] Ew, not really completely familiar with it.

00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,112
But I'm definitely curious--

00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,346
- [Male Aide] I wasn't either.

00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:36,815
So I did a quick little search and it appears

00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,616
to be a top down approach where you first start

00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,385
with your objectives and then finds points

00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,821
to support and then fill in details.

00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,055
- [Catt] Yep.

00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:44,989
That sounds exactly-- - If I'm saying that

00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,224
incorrectly, I apologize.

00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,759
- [Catt] Yeah, that's perfect and exactly what

00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,494
I like to do, because you want to start with the overarching

00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:52,030
idea, then you want to start drilling down a little bit

00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,399
and then you want to, you know, fill in as much detail

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,168
as possible, like once you've identified the initial

00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:58,703
objective that you have.

00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:00,805
So that sounds perfect and I definitely recommend

00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:04,008
using that for your design approach.

00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:07,011
- [Male Aide] Great, thanks so much.

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,683
Could you quickly provide an example of a sub-story?

00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:14,152
- Yes, so that's a great question.

00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,421
So, you'll notice that during my presentation

00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:20,825
I was, so firstly I designed this entire presentation

00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:24,462
to sell to you this idea of telling a story

00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:25,930
with your presentation.

00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,766
But then there were several points during

00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,368
the actual talk that I mentioned, for example,

00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:33,638
the time that the presenter at another conference

00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:36,174
talked about having a heart attack or almost having

00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:40,111
a heart attack and that was to drive home the concept

00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:44,382
of making your presentations more relatable or sharing

00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:47,552
these stories that maybe make you uncomfortable.

00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,521
That's kind of an example of a sub-story,

00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,090
where the overall concept that I'm trying to convey is,

00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,059
hey, you should definitely use storytelling in your talks

00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:58,229
and it worked really well for me to design my presentations

00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:01,766
around this idea of a story but at the same time,

00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:04,335
hey look, here's an example of how it was used

00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:07,038
really well, like this one concept within the larger

00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,506
presentation.

00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:12,043
So, I hope that helps explain what a sub-story

00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:13,311
in this case is.

00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,713
- [Male Aide] Great, absolutely it does.

00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:16,881
Thank you so much.

00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,383
- Mm-hm.

00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,185
- Here's another question that we've had come in.

00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,020
What are the parameters you use to determine

00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,923
the success of delivering an idea via a story?

00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:28,092
So what are the feedback parameters that you use?

00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:29,861
- Yes, so that's a great one.

00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:32,664
So, in terms of the feedback I look for,

00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,835
I firstly look to see that people after the presentation

00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:42,373
are hopefully, positively, either sharing information online

00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:46,611
or come up to me in real life and talk about it.

00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:49,214
So that's number one, just like ensuring that there's

00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,950
overall success of the presentation.

00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,352
During the presentation, I actually look around to see

00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,221
like, are people engaged?

00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,456
Do I need to figure out how to add something in

00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,425
that's more interesting to people?

00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:03,428
So that's another way that I can kind of ensure

00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:07,665
that there is hopefully an overall, like higher success

00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:11,936
rate and then I also look to see, down the line,

00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:15,573
do people remember what I was talking about?

00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,475
Because that's the biggest thing is just making sure

00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:20,612
that what I was saying was useful for them

00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:23,147
and hopefully they'll come up to me and say,

00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,984
oh, like, for example when I talk about learning

00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,486
to program, hopefully someone will come up afterward

00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:31,089
and say, hey, I learned to program as a kid, too,

00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:35,193
using the same exact scripting language that I used.

00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:38,930
You know, it's things like that that really make,

00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,965
like my whole goal is to make the subject

00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:42,934
that I'm talking about seem more relatable.

00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:45,470
And so if it does and people remember

00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,305
these bits and pieces, that's the thing

00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:51,075
that's most important to me most of the time.

00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:53,745
- [Male Aide] Great, thank you so much.

00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,579
- Mm-hm.

00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,515
- I believe this is for your outline.

00:31:57,515 --> 00:32:00,084
And I believe you gave us some structure,

00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,452
but the question reads, is there any toolkit

00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:04,188
which helps in achieving a standard format?

00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:05,690
- [Catt] Mm-hm.

00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,158
That's a good one.

00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:09,260
Maybe that's a thing we should all work on together,

00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,094
I would say.

00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,562
(laughs)

00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:12,397
Unfortunately, I don't think there is a standard

00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,564
format yet.

00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,099
At Etsy, we're starting to run this

00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:19,037
internal, helping to run it with a friend

00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,105
who is also a designer there.

00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,675
And it's more of a process of getting

00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,576
designers to do more public speaking,

00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:28,146
and we're hoping that outline building

00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:29,447
will become more of a thing.

00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,983
My suggestion, in terms of a structure,

00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:34,485
is quite similar to what you may have learned

00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:36,454
in public school for essay writing,

00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,122
which is, you want to have an introduction,

00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,191
and then you want to have maybe three or four

00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,893
pieces of content in between,

00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,962
and then you want to have a conclusion at the end.

00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,164
And, again, it goes back to the beginning,

00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:47,632
middle, and end that people really like

00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,336
in terms of storytelling, but it's also concise

00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,271
and it's easy for people to understand,

00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,640
it's easy for all of us as people

00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,609
who are creating this content to figure out

00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:00,178
how to structure it.

00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:01,579
Like, I always found it very useful,

00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:04,482
when I was younger, to write in that format,

00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,017
because it's very easy to figure out,

00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:09,120
what's my initial statement that I'm trying to talk about,

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,557
okay, and then how do I back that up, basically,

00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:15,193
and then how do I conclude that?

00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,528
So, that's my suggestion, just kind of going back

00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,063
to primary school.

00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:21,599
But, yeah, that's definitely a thing I think

00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,602
should be worked on, like, figuring out

00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:28,339
more formal frameworks for generating content

00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,575
of this format.

00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,344
- Thank you so much.

00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:38,116
So, one thing you touched on is

00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,884
the power of the presentation itself.

00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:41,753
Do you encourage using visual cues

00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:44,022
in your talks and stories?

00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,324
And if so, how do you ensure they are acceptable

00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:50,128
when presenting in a different country or culture?

00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,963
- [Catt] Yeah, that's definitely a tough one.

00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:56,067
So, it was definitely challenging, in this presentation,

00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,670
to figure out how to present the information

00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,072
that I was trying to present.

00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,607
So, in this one specifically,

00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:06,778
there were a ton of words with embellishments upon them,

00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,148
and that was because I was hoping it would be easier

00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,116
for the international audience to understand.

00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:14,552
I definitely do occasionally think about,

00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,788
what do symbols and colors mean in certain places.

00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:19,390
I feel like I don't really know the answer

00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,925
about pink, but I really like pink,

00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,161
so that's one caveat.

00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,430
But that's why, for example, with this one,

00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,532
it's red, but it also has the cross out symbol,

00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:30,868
so it's hopeful that people will understand that.

00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:33,604
And I also did some research into castles around the world

00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,339
to make sure that this would hopefully

00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:36,941
be somewhat recognizable.

00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:41,479
So, I definitely think that it's useful to visually

00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,614
communicate things but you want to back that up

00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:45,116
more with the stuff that you're saying

00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,452
to ensure that the audience understands it

00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,320
because some people who will look at this

00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,256
won't understand exactly what the heck it's supposed to be.

00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:56,427
Or why I'm using it in this context, so I really try hard

00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:01,833
to make my slides very simple and then make sure

00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:06,337
that the spoken word content is more of what people

00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:08,406
are focusing on although I'd want to make sure again

00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:11,275
as you can see, with like the slide that comes afterward

00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,078
I use a lot of words but I use very, very simple

00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:16,114
statements and then I just try to explain that,

00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,550
so hopefully that is helpful for this person

00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,385
who's wondering what to do.

00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,821
But, yeah, this talk, very specifically,

00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:27,325
has a lot of words in it and less imagery,

00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,294
and sometimes I find that useful, like,

00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,296
diagrams are a form of visualization,

00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,333
so I think it's really about figuring out ways

00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:39,203
to communicate your idea in the best way possible

00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:42,006
rather than focusing again on this technique

00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:44,408
of, should I use lots of images or should I not?

00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:46,410
It's really about the content that you're trying

00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,479
to communicate to people.

00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,849
- Great, thank you so much.

00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:55,586
We do have one more question coming in from offline.

00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:57,121
The question reads, you come from

00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,623
a game developer background.

00:35:58,623 --> 00:35:59,891
- [Catt] Yeah.

00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,893
- Do you feel there are other things or elements

00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,861
from your background along with storytelling

00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:07,131
that are applicable to public speaking.

00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:10,301
- Ooh, yeah, that's a good question.

00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:14,372
Yeah, I mean, I think my background specifically,

00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,576
well, I'm really great at self-deprecation,

00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,077
which is really good for the process

00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:23,548
of digging in deep and sharing personal experiences

00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,917
that I've had, so I'm really not afraid to go there,

00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,451
which is really useful.

00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,153
I think that's definitely because

00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:31,155
I'm really used to failing all the time,

00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,658
like when you're making websites or you're making games,

00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:37,161
things break so often, and it's really actually humorous

00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,530
sometimes how poorly things work,

00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,767
so it's really nice to be able to share

00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,268
those experiences with people.

00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:45,836
And I've got lots of experiences

00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:47,505
where things didn't work out, which means

00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,574
I have lots of talk fodder, so I've got lots

00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,008
of different things that I can share

00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:53,377
when I'm talking about something

00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,279
or just as a presentation idea in general,

00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:57,081
which is very nice.

00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,917
I'm also very, very, organized, partially, again,

00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:02,053
because I've gotten used to writing clear and concise

00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:06,958
programming code, which is very nice for listing things out

00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,126
and figuring out, well, how should I communicate

00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:10,661
this thing in the best way possible,

00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:12,163
because I very often have to do that

00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:13,831
for computers and people who will

00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:15,967
look at my code later, so I really like

00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,935
documenting everything, because you never know

00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:20,271
when you're going to need to come back to it later,

00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,806
and that's actually really great

00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:24,242
because I very often find myself reusing

00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,411
content from slides, so I make sure to organize

00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,047
my presentations in an easily accessible place,

00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,683
so I have an entire folder on Google Drive

00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,785
where all of my presentations are,

00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:36,687
and that way, if I ever need to reference

00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,289
a slide that I made before, they're all

00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,523
in the same place.

00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,125
So, I heavily recommend documenting

00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:45,229
your presentations well, writing notes down

00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:46,664
really, really, helps in case you forgot

00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,699
what you were trying to say, and hopefully use

00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:51,669
a similar format for all of them, although

00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:55,039
you honestly can't always control if you're

00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,208
going to have to use Keynote or PowerPoint

00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,310
or Google Drive, sometimes people have

00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,245
their preferences, but make sure you put everything

00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,748
in an easily accessible place because you never know

00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:07,118
when you're going to need that again.

00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,487
- [Male Aide] Great, thank you so much.

00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:10,321
- Yay.

00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:14,158
Any questions in the room?

00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:14,992
- [Male Aide] All right, well, wonderful.

00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:15,926
- Awesome.

00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:17,161
Thanks, all of you, thank you.

00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:18,396
- [Male Aide] Catt, thank you so much

00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:19,630
for taking the time to speak with us today.

00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,931
- [Catt] Of course, happy to be here.

00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:23,267
Yeah, if you have any remaining question,

00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:25,303
you got the information right there,

00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,139
and have a good day/evening, wherever

00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,242
all of you are, and thank everyone in the room.

00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:32,076
- [Javi] Awesome.

00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,377
I think we're good.

00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:36,147
