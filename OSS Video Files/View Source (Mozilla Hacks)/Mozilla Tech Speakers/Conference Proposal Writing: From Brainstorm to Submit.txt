00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,240
- Hi everyone, I'm Havi Hoffman from the Developer Relations team and it's my great pleasure

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:18,860
today to introduce Chiu-Ki Chan and Cate Huston of Technically Speaking, they are going to

00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:25,260
talk today about conference proposal writing, from brainstorm to submit.

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,050
Chiu-Ki and Cate publish Technically Speaking, a weekly newsletter with inspiring links about

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,710
public speaking and conference proposals from tech conferences that treat their speakers

00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:41,280
well, encourage new speakers , and diverse speakers.

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,030
Chiu-Ki is based in Denver where she's an Android developer with a passion for speaking

00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:51,900
and teaching, she recently hosted her first developer event.

00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:59,829
Cate is a mobile developer currently based in Colombia, she travels the world and speaks

00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:06,640
often about tech culture and mobile development and we are very happy to have them here today

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,079
for our final Masterclass of the Tech Speakers Phase 2 summer pilot.

00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,740
If you are a tech speaker and attending from some far-off corner of the world, thank you

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,939
very much for being here, keep in mind that there will be homework associated with this

00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:26,859
presentation, it's the shorter version of what's usually a longer workshop.

00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:35,509
So without further ado, let me bring Cate and Chiu-Ki to the stage, thank you.

00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:37,399
- Thank you Havi.

00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:43,360
Well welcome everyone, today we are going to be talking about, like Havi said, conference

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,389
proposal writing so let's get started.

00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:51,399
Let's go through our agenda so you have an idea of what is going to be happening today.

00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:56,599
First we are going to figure out what you are gonna talk about.

00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:00,419
In other words, own your expertise, what are you good at?

00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:05,280
We are going to have some brainstorming exercise not right now, that's the homework.

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,899
That you can figure out what you'll be speaking about.

00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:13,250
And then we are also going to talk about other ways to build up your expertise so that when

00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,520
you are going to be giving a talk, people already know who you are, essentially.

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,380
After that we will go through the mechanics of what is a proposal, why do you need a bio,

00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,600
how do they make it such that people will want to hear you speak?

00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,340
Afterwards we are going to skip over the write proposal and write bio parts because, again,

00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,480
that's homework.

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,820
Later you will go ahead and take what you learn from this lecture and exercise it with

00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,170
your fellow buddies.

00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:51,620
But we will wrap up the whole talk with “Submit Early, Submit Often” And get into action.

00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,950
Every time when I talk to someone about public speaking, they are always like, it's great,

00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,740
it's something that I should be doing, I know it's good for my career, but they will tell

00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:11,230
me: I have heard this so many times that me and Cate decided that it is time to make stickers.

00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,630
I have something to say, you have something to say, everybody has something to say.

00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,310
Come on, you have lived, I don't know, N years on this earth?

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,830
And you have been doing something that somebody else has not been doing, I guarantee you,

00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,290
you are not living a life that's identical to somebody else.

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:32,040
So you have something to say, you have something interesting, you have your own perspective.

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,520
Now our job is to figure out what that is, and it's not one thing, you have multiple

00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,450
things, right, like you don't live a singular, linear life.

00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,530
This is one way you can discover your expertise, think about recently what you have done.

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,560
Or in my spare time, this is what I do.

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:55,740
Or, professionally I've been doing this for this many years.

00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:01,020
I organize this, I build things, I lead things, there are many many aspects of you that is

00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,020
interesting.

00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,600
Now for us, how do we own our expertise?

00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,260
Why are we qualified to give this workshop?

00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:17,250
In our case both me and Cate are really passionate about public speaking, so much so that we

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,280
have a weekly newsletter.

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,810
Every week we send out links, we send out conference proposals, we send out inspiration

00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,770
so that every week you get that reminder that say, hey, remember, you are trying to become

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,770
a public speaker.

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,210
Do something about it.

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:38,889
So with that, we have built our expertise, we now are known for teaching people how to

00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:42,999
go to conferences and give talks.

00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:47,110
There’s more than one way, though.

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,849
I'll let Cate continue.

00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:55,250
- Chiu-Ki and I were wandering around Copenhagen and that's when we came up with the idea for

00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,250
Technically Speaking.

00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,439
The reason why we were there, though, is 'cause we were both speaking at the same conference

00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,759
in Scandinavia.

00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,009
And the reason why I was there, was because Chiu-Ki had told me to submit to that conference,

00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:13,740
I forget how many times, but she kept telling me to submit until I did.

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,710
(laughing) Basically, the idea was for us to combine things that we were already doing.

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:26,139
Chiu-Ki is an expert on what CFP is open and which conferences are good.

00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:34,409
And for me, my Twitter feed is 25% pictures of raccoons, 50% interesting links, and 25%

00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:35,569
nonsense.

00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:39,909
So the idea was that between us we could take what we were already doing, and we could package

00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:43,389
it to scale ourselves up as a mentor.

00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:47,629
So the idea of Technically Speaking is with a mentor in your inbox every week that says

00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:52,720
"hey, you have something to say, here are some places that you could say it and here's

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,879
some things that might help you."

00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:01,550
We really wanted to demystify conference speaking because it was something that had seemed really

00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,539
opaque to both of us.

00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:12,960
We'd both worked at a pretty insular company where having a public profile was, let's say,

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,749
not encouraged.

00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:19,499
But we've both broken through and built public profiles for ourselves.

00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:22,469
And Chiu-Ki had really helped me a lot as I'd come after her.

00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:27,770
We wanted to do that for other people in a way that would scale.

00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,409
And a core idea of Technically Speaking is that you don't need to be invited, you can

00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:34,740
apply.

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:43,729
But nearly two years later, (laughing) Chiu-Ki and I are mostly invited, and this year I

00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:49,639
actually decided to only give invited talks which seems a little bit hypocritical, but

00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,699
I had a lot on already and I decided to limit myself to six talks and so something really

00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,939
had to give.

00:06:55,939 --> 00:07:03,249
But how did we get to this point?

00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:06,139
Well we show up every week and demonstrate our expertise.

00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:09,830
So like Chiu-Ki said, we send out this newsletter every week.

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,560
And that's a big part of why we both spoke at Write/Speak/Code earlier this year.

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,430
But aside from the newsletter we both show up in other areas.

00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:22,289
Chiu-Ki's blog is one of the best resources on the internet when it comes to testing on

00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:23,830
Android.

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,689
And I have written a lot about a lot of things, but one of my big focuses recently has been

00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:31,770
giving better technical interviews.

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,919
Speaking really builds your reputation but so do other activities.

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,099
And speaking can have quite a long lead time.

00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:45,100
Even if you have a great abstract and bio today, it can be months until you actually

00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,240
get to give it at a conference, just because the lead time for submitting to CFPs and hearing

00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,270
back from them can be so long.

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,520
But writing is completely within your power.

00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,289
If you have a great idea for a blog post, you can write it today and you can publish

00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:02,060
it today.

00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,259
You get to determine the time frame.

00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:11,629
And so writing is a really good way to figure out what topics you have a lot to say about,

00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:16,100
document things that would be really useful in your talks.

00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,619
Create an association between yourself and a topic.

00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:24,270
So when people think about technical interviews now, they think about me, and I know that

00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,020
because they often Tweet about me when they do.

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,130
And it's also a really helpful way to gauge people's interest in the things that you might

00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,260
talk about.

00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,270
So what is it that you've written that's got the most retweets and the most comments?

00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,030
That can be a great basis for a talk.

00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:44,450
And then if you get really pro at writing, you can get to the point where assembling

00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,870
a new talk is really just rearranging your blog posts you've already written about it.

00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:56,170
Chiu-Ki, hand it over to you.

00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,820
- Thank you Cate.

00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,240
So now we understand what does it mean to be an expert, and how do you build that expertise,

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,830
let's get to the mechanics of how do you get into a conference.

00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:13,070
The way it works is that conferences have these things called CFPs which is Call For

00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,370
Proposal.

00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,340
And they invite everybody to submit what they want to talk about.

00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:23,970
Now, some people thought that CFP stands for Call For Paper, so they want the whole thing

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,420
written out already and then they want it to be complete and ready and then submit.

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,470
No no no, this is not how it works.

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,470
The proposal is literally a proposal.

00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,440
I have this idea that I would like to talk about.

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,220
It's a sales pitch.

00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:42,600
And it's not like you need to jam as much information as possible into your proposal,

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,870
this is not how you get accepted.

00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,001
The conference just happened two weeks ago and it has been in making for months, and

00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:55,440
being conference organizers means that I have to pick the talks.

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,990
So I actually saw a lot of proposals, and let me tell you, if you send me a novel, I'm

00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,460
not going to read it.

00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:11,400
So for my conference we had 26 slots for talks and we got 187 proposals.

00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,860
How much time do I have to read each of them?

00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,180
Not a lot.

00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,440
So what you need to do is to sell your talk in a very short amount, the smallest amount

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,380
possible, in fact.

00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,260
Such that when I read it, or the way my conference worked we actually had voters, so we invite

00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,100
people from the community and then we send them the abstracts and then they rank each

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:36,890
talk, give them a score, and then that gets filtered back to the organizers and then we

00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,200
pick the talks.

00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,140
So these people, they have day jobs, they have other things to do.

00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,870
You really need to get their attention very quickly.

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:52,290
So think about your proposal as, hey, you would like to come to my talk, and this is

00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,290
why.

00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,530
Rather than explaining every single thing under the sun that's remotely related to your

00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,530
topic.

00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:02,110
In other words, what is a proposal?

00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:08,800
A startup-slash-techie may know this better, it is an MVP, it's your minimum viable product.

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,170
It's the smallest number of sentences you can use to express what you're going to talk

00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:18,220
about such that people would like to come.

00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,660
Your goal there is to make it easy for them to pick your talk.

00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:26,410
Make it obvious why is this a good talk.

00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,940
What is the topic?

00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:34,640
By that I mean maybe one, two, at most three sentences of what are you going to talk about.

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,530
Do not give the history of the topic, nobody wants to know it in your proposal.

00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,150
Be short, be specific.

00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:45,780
Next up, once you explain what is the topic, give a few concrete things that you'll be

00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,610
talking about.

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,300
This way you are not just telling them, oh this is wonderful, this is great, you actually

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,290
know what you are going to be covering.

00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,780
A few key points.

00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:02,180
And finally, make sure that you know what they are going to be taking away from the

00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,180
topic.

00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:08,100
I am pretty formulary in the sense that, pretty much all the proposals I write at the end

00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:15,040
says, by the end of this talk you will: so either you will learn, or you will be able

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,530
to do this, so that, think about it, right?

00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:22,840
If you go to a conference and you look at all the different talks and you try to decide

00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,530
which one you want to go to, you didn't know that but at the back of your head that is

00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,000
what you are calculating.

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,660
Is this worth one hour of my time?

00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,480
Will I be able to take away something from it such that I want to spend this hour.

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,950
So make that obvious to them, this is literally what you are going to walk away with.

00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:44,750
And that is how your proposal is going to shine.

00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:50,060
I'm going to let Cate give you an example of how she does that.

00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,080
- Thanks Chiu-Ki.

00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,550
So like Chiu-Ki said, a proposal is a sales pitch for your talk.

00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:02,800
So I'm gonna go through an example of a talk that I put together about giving better technical

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,160
interviews.

00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,650
So when I'm writing an abstract, or when I'm helping somebody else write an abstract, what

00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,990
I have us do is to make three lists about it.

00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,240
So the first list is, reasons why this topic is important.

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,700
And the second list is the things that we think that people could take away from this

00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,700
talk.

00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:27,220
And the third list is what points we would plan to cover.

00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,440
So this was a talk I gave about being a better technical interviewer.

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,340
So why was this topic important?

00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:39,170
Well interviewing, as an interviewer or an interviewee, is really stressful.

00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:43,860
The whole purpose of it is that we have to make an important decision, but we have incomplete

00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:49,380
information, and we wanna get as much information as possible, but in a respectful way.

00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:55,300
There's not enough training on interviewing, how many people at a big company have basically

00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,510
been told how not to break the law, and really not anything else?

00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:04,670
And we get very little feedback.

00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,780
What things did I want people to take away from it?

00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:11,890
I wanted people to feel confident that they had a path to becoming a better interviewer.

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:16,740
I wanted them to have an idea of why this work was worthwhile, because there was a lot

00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,740
of it.

00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,000
And I wanted them to focus on what they could control.

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,290
So what do I cover in this talk?

00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:31,090
I cover some ways to make people feel more comfortable, I talk about how to give feedback,

00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:35,500
I go into detail about what does a good technical question look like?

00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,900
And I also talk about time management.

00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,230
Time management is really important in this context.

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,920
And I talk about removing bias in feedback.

00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,470
So let's look at my abstract.

00:14:46,470 --> 00:15:10,280
Alright, I'll read it to you: So did you notice something?

00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:42,740
Pretty much nothing on the third list made it into my abstract.

00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,910
And so the reason why I have people make that third list is so that we can decide what to

00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,210
leave out.

00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:52,170
People have this tendency when they're putting together an abstract that they really just

00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:57,000
put together a summary of their talk which is not a sales pitch.

00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,130
It doesn't sound very compelling.

00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:05,150
Like Chiu-Ki said, and I'm just gonna say again, don't summarize your talk in your abstract.

00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,570
Sell your talk in your abstract.

00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:14,250
To get started, getting started is the hardest part when it comes to, really anything, right?

00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,500
So I have a formula that I use.

00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:24,130
It starts with a strong statement about why this topic is important at a macro level.

00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:29,680
And then some specific points that tie this more narrow topic to this macro point.

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,100
Then the second half of the abstract mentions two to three important points that you're

00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:40,290
going to cover, and then after which you will be able to, like Chiu-Ki said this is a really

00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:44,320
important bit, concrete audience takeaway.

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,550
Alright, now Chiu-Ki's gonna talk a bit about crafting a bio.

00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:55,740
- Thank you, Cate.

00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:00,570
Even greater when you can hear me.

00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:04,890
So that's great, now we have a sales pitch.

00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:11,100
You have a way to convince people to move the mic closer.

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:19,470
Okay this is not working.

00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:30,090
Okay, I will stop touching equipment now.

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:40,370
(indistinct conversation) Great, now you have a great sales pitch, you have a way to convince

00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,730
people that this is a great topic, this will be a great talk.

00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,650
But we still have one missing piece of information.

00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,350
Why you?

00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,900
Who are you?

00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:56,360
Why do you want to give this talk and why are you the correct person to do it?

00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,970
This is where the bio comes in.

00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:02,820
The bio is a way to fill that blank, essentially.

00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,980
And one thing I see a lot is people have this one bio which is their life history, starting

00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:13,380
from which college they graduated, which companies they worked, which country they traveled to,

00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,770
how many pets do they have, et cetera, et cetera.

00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,210
No, this is not how you put in a conference bio.

00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:24,400
The conference bio needs to be specific to your talk.

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,820
The whole point of having the bio is such that when the conference organizers or whoever

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,590
is making that decision of inviting you to give that talk, have some information about

00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,370
why you are a good person to give this talk.

00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:41,559
So you want to tailor it, you want to curate experiences from your life that's relevant

00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:45,800
to the talk and put that in your bio.

00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,250
How does that actually work?

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,900
Let me show you some examples.

00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:55,650
This is my bio, I'm gonna show you two versions of my bio, and then we can see which one do

00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,890
you think I should be using for this particular talk?

00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:09,880
I'm gonna read it out loud to you.

00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:21,720
I don't usually read my own bio aloud.

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:35,250
Next version.

00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,230
So the first part that is black is exactly the same, I'm not going to read that out loud

00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,230
to you.

00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:55,250
So I'm gonna read out loud the purple part.

00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:03,309
So now we have bio A and bio B. Which one do you think I should be using for this particular

00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:06,050
talk that I'm giving right now?

00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,170
B, yes!

00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:14,090
And I put on my favorite color purple, just to bias you a little bit.

00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,380
But why, why is this a better bio for this talk?

00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,270
Well I'm here to talk about public speaking.

00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:25,429
While, yes, I wrote all these awesome apps that are very nice and I would love you to

00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:30,090
check them out, this is how I can convince you that I am the person to give this talk.

00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:37,510
I have experience in public speaking, and I have experience in teaching public speaking.

00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:44,910
What you want to do is, it's very difficult to cater it 100%, so you notice that the first

00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,809
two sentences are the same for both versions.

00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:51,710
And that's what I call, I am awesome, you want to listen to me, sentences.

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:56,650
So that part is pretty much constant, I just start with, I'm an Android developer, I like

00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:00,420
speaking, I like teaching, and then put some credentials in there that is generally about

00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,420
me.

00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:06,580
But then I end the bio with something that's specific to the conference.

00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:13,080
And this way, it complements your proposal, so that hey, great talk, great person to give

00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,400
it, alright, you are on.

00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,690
So one pro tip, I don't know about you but for me it's very difficult to talk about how

00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,690
great I am.

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:29,200
Sure, I put on a show right now to say how awesome I am, but in reality most of us a

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,490
little bit shy, we don't want to be like, oh wow, I am the most amazing person on Earth.

00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:41,790
So do it with a buddy, have a friend, and you tell each other how great you are.

00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:46,570
It actually helps a lot, so go ahead, write bios for each other, and then you can critique,

00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:50,700
you can help each other out, and talk it out loud, like what are the different things that

00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,700
you have done in your life.

00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,370
That is much better than just sitting there on your side and say, I am great, I need to

00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,830
tell the world I'm great.

00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,670
Get a friend and get some help.

00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,610
Cate.

00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:10,480
- Thanks, Chiu-Ki.

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,620
So I talked a little bit earlier about how Chiu-Ki and I started Technically Speaking.

00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:22,480
And how we wanted to encourage people with, you don't have to wait to be asked you can

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,870
apply.

00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:30,200
Most conferences have a CFP process and let me give you a pro tip, that CFP process does

00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,860
not take place in your head.

00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:37,720
Don't rule yourself out, submit and see what happens.

00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,690
So when should you submit to a conference?

00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:43,660
Well, when you have an idea that you are enthused about and you have an event that you would

00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,410
be excited to speak at.

00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,690
Do not overthink it.

00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:52,190
Rejection doesn't necessarily mean anything, it might just mean that it wasn't a fit for

00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,190
that event.

00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:57,890
Either because of the way that they're curating, or because they already have a talk that would

00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,950
be too similar.

00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,350
Refine it and resubmit it.

00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:10,110
Our sticker and tee-shirts say, you have something to say, and it's because we really believe

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:13,800
that you have something to say, that everybody has something to say that we would all be

00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,280
better off hearing.

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:21,920
So please don't get discouraged and start ruling yourself out, like we say, submit early,

00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,600
submit often.

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:30,970
Thanks so much, we have some homework for y'all which Chiu-Ki is now going to explain.

00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:37,100
- Homework time.

00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:43,090
I hope you are all excited and you want to get into action, so this is something that

00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:46,630
you can do with a couple of friends, or you can do at your company.

00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:52,010
The idea is that we want you to get together and actually sit down and figure out what

00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:56,860
topic you'll be talking about, write the proposal, get feedback, write the bio, get feedback,

00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,580
and then go ahead and submit.

00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,150
So let me step you through how are you going to do that.

00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,230
Step number one, split into groups.

00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,130
All these exercises you will be doing with your buddy group.

00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:12,250
You can do the grouping in different ways, maybe with people that are in your same team,

00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:18,250
or maybe if you have a broader group then people that are same interest or same geographical

00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:22,660
area, so that maybe you are like, I would like to speak in Barcelona and you can get

00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,130
other people who would like to speak in that region so that you can keep an eye out on

00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:28,550
the conferences for each other.

00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:33,750
So once you have that group, we will go through the exercise what we call Own Your Expertise.

00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,840
So first of all you sit down, do the exercise on your own, it's a 30-minute exercise of

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,150
brainstorming and figure out what you can be talking about.

00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:44,460
The link I include here is the detail instructions.

00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,020
So go ahead and sit down and brainstorm and come up with all the different topics that

00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,490
you may be interested in speaking.

00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:56,160
Once you have that, you can write your proposal.

00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,870
We have included two links here, and of course if you subscribe to the newsletter you will

00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:06,030
get weekly more resources into your inbox nonstop until you actually write your proposal.

00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:11,330
So what you do is go ahead and write proposals about some of the ideas that you had.

00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:17,850
And then read each other's proposal and try to figure out, do I want to go to this conference,

00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:22,110
and if yes, what makes it compelling, and if not, what is lacking?

00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:26,530
So give each of the feedback, and iterate on that.

00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:29,800
Once you have your proposal it's time to write your bio.

00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:34,830
Let me reiterate: write your bio that is specific to the proposal.

00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,460
Make sure that it is not just your life history.

00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:42,840
And here is a really good blog post about how to do that, it's a five-step points on

00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,130
do this and do that.

00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:49,130
So read that, and then write your bio, and then talk to your buddy and make sure that

00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,140
your bio supports your proposal.

00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:57,530
Now once you have your bio and your proposal, we need to submit them somewhere.

00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:01,280
Yes, you're not just writing them and hoping that something good will happen.

00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,750
You need to actually push it all the way through.

00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:07,540
Once you submit that then it's off your hands, so we need to get you through to that point.

00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:12,390
If you have never spoken before, or you have never been to conferences before, this part

00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:17,700
can be quite daunting, like this whole world of conferences, where are they?

00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:23,330
So the way I do it, I'm an Android developer so I will go on my favorite search engine

00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:27,050
and type Android Conference.

00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,700
And then see what comes up.

00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:33,260
So the way you do it is maybe you found one conference, three conferences, but you don't

00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,260
stop right there.

00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:39,820
You take that conference, and then you look at the previous editions and look at the schedule.

00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,170
And then you see who spoke there.

00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:47,470
Most of the speakers will have a speaker profile on their website, that lists all the talks

00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,470
they have given.

00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,010
And by the way, you should make one too.

00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:54,110
Once you have a few, or even just one, have a speaker profile so that when people are

00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:58,190
looking and seeing who is this person, why should I let her into my conference?

00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:03,100
Oh, well actually she has given multiple talks and she knows what she's talking about.

00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,410
So having the speaker profile is great for you and most of the other speakers will have

00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,410
them as well.

00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:11,430
So go to the conference, look up the name, find out what other conferences they have

00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:16,340
spoken at, and that's how you expand the circle of conferences and now you have multiple of

00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,850
them that you can submit to.

00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:24,120
So now you have the proposal, you have the bio, and you have the conference.

00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,120
Submit!

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,010
Like Cate already covered, submit early, submit often.

00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:33,070
Don't think too hard about it, and yes, it is okay to submit the same talk proposal to

00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:38,730
multiple conferences, and yes, it is okay to submit more than one proposal to the same

00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,220
conference.

00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:44,320
For some reason, I don't know why, people got it into their head that you can only do

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,809
one brand new talk per conference, so they are constantly trying to come up with new

00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:52,120
ideas, no, that's too exhausting.

00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,160
A lot of the times, your audience will be different when you give it at a different

00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,160
venue.

00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,790
Maybe they are just geographically different at a different place, maybe they are at a

00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:07,780
different level at their career, and in general you have put in so much work for your talk,

00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,170
more people deserve to see it.

00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:13,260
So don't deny them of that chance, submit early, submit often, submit everywhere.

00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:17,280
And I am gonna scroll down 'cause there's actually one more step.

00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,280
Finally, at the end of the whole workshop, exchange contact information with your buddy

00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,300
group and stay in touch.

00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:27,940
Keep each other posted if you have submitted to some conferences and then you get accepted,

00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,110
tell other people, celebrate together, if you heard about a conference let other people

00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,900
know, keep each other accountable.

00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:46,220
And happy submitting! (scattered applause) I think we have time for questions, but I'm

00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:56,960
not sure what's the logistics of taking questions, so I'm gonna let Havi drive that part.

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,050
- Yeah, we're taking questions?

00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,070
- Sure.

00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,090
(laughing)

00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:07,740
- [Voiceover] So our first question comes in involves titling your papers.

00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:13,049
Are there certain catchy titles that can be used, or certain best practices for titling

00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:14,419
your CFP?

00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:20,300
- Yes, we are smiling because I have a blog post called "Fancy Titles Considered Harmful."

00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,200
Let me tell you a story, this is the easiest way to explain this.

00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:30,780
What happened was that I was going to give a talk at OSCON, and I titled it, "Bust the

00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:35,010
Android Fragmentation Myth," which I thought was very catchy and awesome.

00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:40,540
But what happened was that it did not convey what I'm actually talking about which is,

00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:44,840
I'm talking about how do you deal with the fact that there are so many different form

00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,000
factors for Android, you have tablets and phone.

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,750
And I'm actually covering the tactics of that, how do you deal with that.

00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:56,190
So at the end of the talk someone actually came up to me and said, I'm so glad I came,

00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,410
I had no idea this was what you're covering.

00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,640
That's exactly what I needed.

00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,970
So later edition of that talk I actually just titled it "Supporting Multiple Devices for

00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:05,970
Android."

00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:11,400
And that is so much more obvious, and like I said during the actual lecture, make it

00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,650
obvious, make it easy for people to accept.

00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,840
So I would say, actually err on the side of obvious.

00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:24,739
Fancy titles sounds like fun but usually what happens is it confuses people.

00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:29,500
- Thank you for that.

00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,580
Another question we had come in, So if you have a special circumstance that you need

00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:39,790
to communicate to an organizer or a venue, when is the appropriate time to communicate

00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,790
that?

00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:46,520
- That really depends on what it is.

00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,570
In general I don't ask for things until after I'm accepted.

00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:57,500
So I think that's a good rule, but you also maybe want to start communicating things before

00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
it's announced.

00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,660
Because there are definitely situations where organizers don't respond well to requests

00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:06,420
that they should absolutely respond well to, but they don't do it.

00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,600
And then you may have to decide that you don't want to speak at that event.

00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,390
So kind of finding that balance.

00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:20,200
I've definitely fought for things at conferences, so last year I pulled out of a conference

00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,590
because they refused to have a code of conduct.

00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:28,640
And that was actually after it was announced, it was really not a fun experience.

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:34,010
This year I had a much better experience, I had to ask for security for various reasons

00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:39,789
that I won't go into, and it was actually quite hard to get.

00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:45,620
And I ended up having to be quite forceful, I channeled my inner Chiu-Ki.

00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:51,590
But I did eventually get what I want, so kind of the sweet spot is between when you're accepted

00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,919
and when it's announced.

00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:55,890
Be as specific as possible.

00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:01,350
And don't let, conferences can often be like organizations where they will inflict their

00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:04,860
internal org structure on you, and they'll be like, you should speak to this person,

00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:09,350
but you don't know those people, whoever is emailing you is the person that you speak

00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,350
to.

00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:14,049
And you make them deal with it, and if they won't deal with it, some other event will

00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:15,980
be more deserving of your time.

00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:21,020
- Yeah so I just want to quickly add to that.

00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,799
One thing I learned about public speaking and specifically at conferences, is that everything

00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,169
is negotiable.

00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:33,550
But the best moment to negotiate is after they have accepted you already, because they

00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,960
want you to be there.

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:41,620
So for example, when I first started speaking I had no idea that some conferences have limited

00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,809
budget to be able to help you get there.

00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:47,820
So I was limiting myself to just local conferences.

00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:52,660
But don't do that, submit early, submit often, just submit already, and then once you are

00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:57,100
in, you can start the negotiation process and say, hey, I'm so excited, but I'm actually

00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:03,270
a freelancer and I do not have a company that is able to provide the traveling for me, would

00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,870
you be able to do that?

00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:11,960
And at that point in the conversation, the cards are aligned on your side.

00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:17,600
So don't make assumptions that, oh, because they never explicitly state your request,

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,920
that is like we pay for all speakers' traveling expense, that doesn't mean that they won't.

00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:29,160
Bear in mind that, just submit, get your foot in the door and then start the conversation.

00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,130
But before they announce, so that they don't, it's a little bit trickier once they announce,

00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,500
then you pull out.

00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,000
That is the sweet spot.

00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,059
- I have one, it's kind of from a comment we got on IRC saying, it can help to be on

00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:51,380
the other side of a CFP, meaning you're the conference organizer, so I wonder if you saw

00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:57,910
yourself following these rules when you were reviewing proposals for your own conference

00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:03,760
recently, Chiu-Ki, or either of you could comment on what's your perception on the other

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,760
side evaluating?

00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,909
- I reviewed conference proposals recently and it was so interesting, and I wish I had

00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:18,390
done it sooner 'cause I felt like I got a profound level of insight into what was going

00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,390
on.

00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,649
And I absolutely used these rules.

00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:24,120
A lot of proposals just seemed a little lazy.

00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:29,649
So if I didn't know what I was gonna take away from the talk then I would score it low,

00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:35,169
if I felt like someone had not really put much thought into the audience, they were

00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:39,109
just like, oh, I played with this thing and it seems cool and now I wanna come and talk

00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:45,250
to a bunch of people about it for 45 minutes, then that would also score low, and the talks

00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,750
that I would score high were the ones where I'm like, I don't know what they're gonna

00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:53,629
say but I feel like I have a really good idea of why someone would want to go to this, and

00:34:53,629 --> 00:34:56,300
what they would walk away with.

00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:01,420
- Yeah and that is one very good tip, is if you are interested and you have the time,

00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:06,780
a lot of the conferences will have a voting round, where they send all of the proposals

00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,480
to you, maybe they scrub off the name of the people if it's a blind round, and then you

00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,420
get a chance to see a lot of proposals, to the order of like 100 to 200, all at the same

00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,420
conference.

00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:22,740
And at that point your brain can do pattern matching and figure out, oh, so this is how

00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:27,849
a good proposal look like, and the ones that are like, I just wanna sell you my product,

00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:30,050
you can clearly see that, no no no, not those.

00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:34,440
- But you can also see what kind of topics are like a little too popular right now, so

00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,310
that you can kind of stay away from them.

00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:42,080
I think it took me about four hours to do this, and it was a really useful four hours

00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:50,550
of my time even not for me, but for other people, that I could guide them towards better

00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:53,090
topics 'cause I'd seen this bigger picture.

00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:57,780
- Yeah, so volunteer yourself, a lot of the times the way the conference organizers find

00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,599
people is just within their own circle.

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,900
But if you are interested and you saw a conference that just closed their CFP, go ahead and ping

00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:09,270
the organizers and say, hi, I'm wondering if you need reviewers for your proposals and

00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,320
I would be happy to chip in some time.

00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:17,530
- I think especially an event that you spoke at last year, is a good one to follow up afterwards

00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:21,070
and say, I really enjoyed speaking at your event, I thought you did a great job, I'd

00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:25,869
love to help you next year if you need someone to review proposals, let me know.

00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:29,890
- Thank you for that.

00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:35,800
Apart from blogging and speaking publicly, what other tips do you recommend for building

00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,450
up your credibility?

00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:42,420
- Twitter, I'm obviously a renowned expert on adorable raccoon pictures.

00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,570
(laughing) So yeah, I think Twitter's good.

00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,990
- Stack Overflow if you like answering questions.

00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:55,830
I actually very purposefully did that, when I first became a freelancer I started writing

00:36:55,830 --> 00:37:01,940
a lot of stuff and being more active on Twitter and I also answered enough questions on Stack

00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,940
Overflow.

00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,360
It's interesting because the points are kind of like a savings account, once you have a

00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:11,520
few questions that are general, and people start upvoting them, then your reputation's

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,480
just kind of took care of itself.

00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:19,420
But that's one other thing that people will look to have, it's a sad shortcut but it is

00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:23,480
a shortcut that people take, if you have, ooh, she has a thousand points on Stack Overflow,

00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,580
she probably know what she's talking about.

00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:30,420
So that's one other place that you can invest your effort in establishing your credibility.

00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:35,550
- I would say also open sourcing stuff, so you don't have to just open source code.

00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:41,410
We actually run Technically Speaking open-source so you can see our issues in GitHub, you can

00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:45,720
search them in GitHub, and you can actually see how it gets built up over time so you

00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:50,760
can see the issues that we assembled the night before and the ones that were built up in

00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,230
a less rushed way.

00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:57,760
I also put together a guide for doing technical interviews for my team when I was interviewing

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,130
earlier this year, and I open-sourced that out on GitHub too.

00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:08,099
Those are other ways that you can kind of create something that showcases your expertise

00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:12,229
in an area.

00:38:12,229 --> 00:38:17,310
- And another question that we had come in, how many people are currently involved with

00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,310
Technically Speaking?

00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:20,030
- There's two, this is it.

00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,529
- The whole team is here!

00:38:21,529 --> 00:38:24,349
- Yeah, we're so happy to be here.

00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:30,200
(laughing) But like I said, we put it on GitHub so people can submit issues, and people can

00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:36,390
send us CFPs, they can send us links that they think that we should include.

00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:40,619
We're hoping that more people get a little bit more involved, and we definitely have

00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:47,250
some very dedicated readers that we see as a core part of the Technically Speaking crew.

00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:51,609
- Yeah, now that we have the issues, I started actually getting links that I was like, if

00:38:51,609 --> 00:38:56,890
you would do us a favor and actually wrote a sentence or two about it, that would make

00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:59,020
our job so much easier.

00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:03,450
We are starting to get that as well, so I guess we have a little bit of extended team

00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,570
but not really, it's mostly the two of us.

00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:09,319
- But we know there are people who evangelize Technically Speaking.

00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:12,050
- We have an underground.

00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:18,300
- And we did a mentoring program last year and so we had people who volunteered to be

00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,300
mentors and stuff so that's really cool.

00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,960
And then of course we have our sustaining sponsors so they're very close to our heart

00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,420
because they make sure that Technically Speaking will keep going.

00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,940
- Can I follow on to that?

00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:33,769
Can you tell us a little more about your mentoring program, how that works?

00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:37,920
- So we just did it as, what was it, our 18-month-iversary?

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,050
- Yeah, usually we do those things as a celebration.

00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:44,056
So I forgot which milestone we did that, but what happened was, we asked people to, it

00:39:44,056 --> 00:39:52,900
was at the end of the year, so it must be like a one-year, have a 2016 Speaking Goals,

00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,900
essentially.

00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:59,859
Like a New Year resolution, and then we tried to pair them up with someone for just a one-hour

00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:03,770
mentoring session actually, so it's not much of a program, but more like a one time, hey

00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:07,340
these are your goals, let's make it happen.

00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:12,590
And then it's up to them whether to follow up, or just have one hour and then call it

00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,590
a day.

00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:18,839
But I think a large part of the exercise is also just having you sit down and actually

00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:24,430
write, most of the time we want a public, if not a blog post, a Tweet, so you have to

00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:28,330
crystallize your thoughts, say why do you want to make public speaking a priority and

00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,170
what exactly you are trying to do.

00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:32,580
And I think that alone already helped a lot of people.

00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:38,130
And then plus we get that little push from the mentor to direct them specifically where

00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,420
they should be working on.

00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,820
- Well a lot of mentoring programs are very ineffective because they promise too much

00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:49,530
and they don't give people a structure to be effective mentees, and so we put a lot

00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:54,040
of thought into how do we time-box this for the mentors so we only ask them for an hour

00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:58,660
of their time, and how do we send people to the mentors in a way where they will get the

00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,940
absolute most out of it.

00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:06,760
So first was this public statement of, these are my goals for 2016, and then second was

00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:12,380
we sent them emails which was like, this is how you should communicate with your mentor,

00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,440
this is the kind of thing that you should ask for, this is the work you should do ahead

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:22,460
of time, and then we also let the mentors know what they should be expecting and what

00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,460
it was reasonable for them to ask for.

00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:29,250
And all this is documented on my blog, there's a blog post about running a mentoring program.

00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:34,160
- Looks like we have one more question, coming in from the laptop, but real quick I'll ask

00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,849
if anyone inside the room has any questions?

00:41:37,849 --> 00:41:38,990
Great.

00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:44,710
What tips do you offer for somebody submitting a CFP on a topic they've never spoken on before?

00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,430
- Have they written about it?

00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,430
- Pardon?

00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,060
- Write blog posts, is the.

00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:54,070
- So I guess in theory this is their first time presenting on the topic, but something

00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,070
that they're familiar with.

00:41:55,070 --> 00:42:01,560
- Yeah so I think to start, writing things about that topic, and also to get an understanding

00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:07,589
of what it is people need to hear about that topic, so to search other talks on that topic

00:42:07,589 --> 00:42:13,870
and try and find what's generally being said about it and kind of find their unique take

00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:14,870
on this thing.

00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:20,980
- So one thing I have done is I have literally given half a talk at a meetup.

00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:27,640
So basically I have enough material that I think is interesting, but I don't have enough

00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:33,210
to make a full talk, so I approach one of the meetup organizers are always looking for

00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:36,940
speakers, that is a tip, so they will even take half a talk.

00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:42,450
So I tell them, I say hey, I have this topic that I would like to speak about, but it's

00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:46,869
a 45-minute slot and I only have 20 minutes of material, but I still would like to come

00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:48,980
in and present my 20 minutes.

00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:55,900
And then get feedback, and discuss with the crowd that showed up, and see what they think,

00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:00,869
what this inspires them, or what this applies to this case, and then I actually did build

00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:03,780
up the rest of the talk because of that half-talk.

00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:08,080
So you could iterate, a talk is one unit, but it's okay to give half a talk.

00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:13,400
And meetup in general is a great place for you to do that, you can also give lightning

00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,770
talks, that's only five minutes, again usually you have some time afterwards to socialize

00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:23,890
and network and you can use that as a place to say, hey, what do you think about my talk,

00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:28,339
is there anything else you would add to that, and expand from that.

00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:31,150
I like using talks to get more talks.

00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:37,110
Blogs are great, but I am a very, I don't know why, but when I talk things aloud the

00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:40,269
thought becomes much more real and they are much more.

00:43:40,269 --> 00:43:43,160
- So what you're saying is that you're an extrovert.

00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:48,280
- Okay, fine, I guess Cate can give you the introvert version of this, but as an extrovert

00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:52,359
going to meetups and talking it out loud, giving half talks was actually very helpful.

00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:54,320
- I think meetups are good because they're much less intimidating.

00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:59,060
There's fewer people, it's generally a community of people who go most months.

00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:05,680
And the quality of talks is lower than the average quality of a conference talk because

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:11,660
it's a meetup, it's free or five, ten dollars, and it's just a different thing.

00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:15,690
I actually love meetups for convincing other people to give talks.

00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:20,030
- I do that too.

00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,030
(laughing)

00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:27,562
- So I went to a meetup with one of the engineers on my team, and he was like, that was a terrible

00:44:27,562 --> 00:44:28,562
talk.

00:44:28,562 --> 00:44:29,562
- You can do better!

00:44:29,562 --> 00:44:32,260
- Yeah, no that's exactly what I did.

00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,381
- Why don't you give a talk?

00:44:33,381 --> 00:44:34,381
- See, you could do better than that.

00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:38,550
And then I talked him into giving his first talk at the meetup, it was great.

00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:42,290
- I actually run a meetup and I am always out there looking for speakers, partially

00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:48,330
because I do need speakers, for some reason that is a very strong motivation when you

00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:54,099
go and say, I need help, help me, give a talk, and it's actually, I'm trying to get them

00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:58,230
to talk, but I phrased it in such a way that please help me because I have no speaker,

00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:02,430
and I actually get a lot of people respond to that much better than, you need to give

00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:09,700
a talk 'cause it's good for your career.

00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,700
It's amazing, yeah.

00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:15,670
- If there's no more questions in the room, last call for questions in the room.

00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:20,119
I was gonna pull a trick one like, what do you think about co-presenting, have you ever

00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:21,119
tried that?

00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,119
(laughing)

00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:23,859
- This is the second co-presenting.

00:45:23,859 --> 00:45:29,572
It's good with someone you know well, and that you can, I think it would be really hard

00:45:29,572 --> 00:45:32,030
with a stranger, oh my God.

00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,790
- You're wonderful presenting together.

00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:39,660
Thank you so so much, it's really chock full of really useful information, so thank you

00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:43,020
again, and that's all for now.

00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,920
- Thanks so much for having us.

00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,359
