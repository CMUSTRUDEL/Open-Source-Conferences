- Hi everyone, thank you for joining us today.

00:00:29,452 --> 00:00:31,144
My name is Havi Hoffman,

00:00:31,144 --> 00:00:34,311
I'm from the Developer Relations Team.

00:00:35,232 --> 00:00:37,682
I'm here in the San Francisco office,

00:00:37,682 --> 00:00:41,148
and for all you folks out there in Air Mozilla land,

00:00:41,148 --> 00:00:43,830
it's my great pleasure to kick off our

00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,580
Winter 2017 Mozilla Tech Speakers

00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:50,656
Masterclass Season with Lara Hogan.

00:00:51,505 --> 00:00:54,290
She's an Engineering Director from Etsy,

00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,815
she comes to us today from New York,

00:00:56,815 --> 00:01:00,772
and she's the author of several books:

00:01:00,772 --> 00:01:03,251
Designing for Web Performance,

00:01:03,251 --> 00:01:06,070
Building a Device Lab, and today's topic,

00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,800
Demystifying Public Speaking.

00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,861
Lara will talk for about 40 minutes,

00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:12,986
please save your questions till the end,

00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:14,915
we'll have a great Q and A session.

00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:18,475
And now without further ado, let me introduce Lara.

00:01:18,475 --> 00:01:19,776
Thank you. - Thank you!

00:01:19,776 --> 00:01:22,490
(audience clapping)

00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,881
Hey everybody, and hello everybody in Air Mozilla.

00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:27,194
It's actually super-cool to be here,

00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:30,421
especially working with a company that invests in

00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:32,801
people who work here to help them get up and speak.

00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,412
Very rarely have I been able to talk to a company

00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:36,851
that actually is thinking about this stuff,

00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:38,261
and helping to encourage their folks

00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:41,487
get up and do this stuff, so I'm super-jazzed to be here.

00:01:41,487 --> 00:01:44,628
I've chosen some specific talk topics for today

00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:47,211
based on the information that Havi shared with me

00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:49,579
about the other stuff that other Masterclass speakers

00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:50,815
are covering, to make sure we don't

00:01:50,815 --> 00:01:53,680
do lots of duplicate work.

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,638
I've basically picked

00:01:54,638 --> 00:01:57,226
and chosen some stuff from the book topic,

00:01:57,226 --> 00:01:59,746
Demystifying Public Speaking, that felt most appropriate

00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:03,089
to share with you all here today with my speaking voice,

00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,193
rather than the reading voice.

00:02:04,193 --> 00:02:06,116
So, definitely feel free to ask me questions,

00:02:06,116 --> 00:02:08,798
not just about this stuff, but about anything else

00:02:08,798 --> 00:02:10,170
that may peak your interest while we're here.

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,762
Again, questions at the end.

00:02:12,762 --> 00:02:16,418
So, this is a picture of me giving my first big talk,

00:02:16,418 --> 00:02:18,735
it was to a crowd of more than 400 people.

00:02:18,735 --> 00:02:21,840
I was invited to come and give a talk about web performance,

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,279
and a few days before the conference started,

00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:26,955
I took a look at the website, and I realized,

00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:29,014
I was scheduled actually to do a keynote,

00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:32,259
and no one had thought to mention that that was the deal.

00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:34,328
So I actually, I revamped the content,

00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:37,706
I made it a little more accessible for a broader audience.

00:02:37,706 --> 00:02:39,894
And then as I was standing by the side of the stage

00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:43,660
waiting for them to introduce me, I started to realize

00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,659
they had actually invited the wrong person.

00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:47,590
They began to read the biography

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,708
of someone who definitely wasn't me

00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,876
as they were introducing me to get on stage, and I realized,

00:02:52,876 --> 00:02:56,585
oh no, I'm like literally an impostor up here.

00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:59,668
Look at my face, I'm in so much pain!

00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:01,903
Poor Lara.

00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:04,678
But that wasn't the end, I kept on going.

00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:07,038
I continued to give talks on web performance,

00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:09,760
and on other topics a bunch.

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,311
There's no good reason why I kept on doing it,

00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:13,094
other than like, I thought to myself

00:03:13,094 --> 00:03:14,462
"This can't get worse, right?

00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:16,105
"This could only get better from here."

00:03:16,105 --> 00:03:17,951
So, I've had the privilege of giving lots of talks

00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:19,622
to lots of different groups of folks,

00:03:19,622 --> 00:03:20,909
different sizes of audiences,

00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,419
and I've gotten a handle on what feels like

00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:25,252
to get up into a physical spotlight

00:03:25,252 --> 00:03:28,494
and say some prepared words to someone.

00:03:28,494 --> 00:03:30,006
But I do wanna highlight that public speaking

00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:32,248
isn't just about conference talks.

00:03:32,248 --> 00:03:34,939
It's about any moment when you have this spotlight on you,

00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:37,478
and you have to say those prepared words to some people,

00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:39,175
hopefully without bursting into tears,

00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:40,754
or puking on yourself.

00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,914
And we do all of this in our industry already,

00:03:42,914 --> 00:03:45,089
we're already doing things like

00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:48,175
talking about code in-person, and having team standups;

00:03:48,175 --> 00:03:49,701
asking your boss for a promotion,

00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:51,529
maybe pitching a project to your team.

00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:52,506
Our designer friends out there

00:03:52,506 --> 00:03:54,874
will be thinking about giving design critiques.

00:03:54,874 --> 00:03:56,041
We're already doing this stuff,

00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,050
it doesn't have to just be in a conference setting,

00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,445
or a meet-up setting.

00:03:59,445 --> 00:04:01,792
So, everything that you already do day-to-day

00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:03,479
you can utilize those skills

00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,997
for the physical spotlight when it happens.

00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,821
I do also wanna highlight that most of us get nervous

00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:10,696
when we're in the spotlight.

00:04:10,696 --> 00:04:12,551
So, I'm gonna guess that the majority of people

00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:14,993
viewing this today, get a little bit anxious

00:04:14,993 --> 00:04:16,442
when they think about public speaking.

00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:19,708
There's a famous survey that found that

00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,421
Americans fear public speaking

00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:24,371
more than heights, or spiders, or death,

00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:27,082
but this is true just for not Americans as well.

00:04:27,082 --> 00:04:29,944
The public speaking fears, I think, rattle our industry,

00:04:29,944 --> 00:04:31,234
and I know that all of you are excited

00:04:31,234 --> 00:04:32,393
to get up and do public speaking,

00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:33,592
that's why you're watching this talk.

00:04:33,592 --> 00:04:34,745
But I do wanna see

00:04:34,745 --> 00:04:38,810
if some these fears might resonate with you.

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,643
So, we're not gonna talk about

00:04:39,643 --> 00:04:42,322
how to write a good presentation, or a slide deck.

00:04:42,322 --> 00:04:44,381
What we're gonna focus on is what will help

00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:48,113
prepare you, as an individual, to get into that spotlight.

00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:49,797
I'm gonna walk through some different tactics

00:04:49,797 --> 00:04:51,109
that work for different kinds of people

00:04:51,109 --> 00:04:54,000
based on fears of being judged, or fumbling our words,

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,527
or making sure we don't trip and fall

00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:57,551
as we get on stage, which is my personal

00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:59,612
number one fear about public speaking.

00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:01,069
I'm also not gonna ask you

00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:03,313
to sound like you're giving a TED talk.

00:05:03,313 --> 00:05:05,379
I'm not gonna talk about public speaking rules,

00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:08,323
because I think that having a homogenous group of speakers

00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:09,156
isn't the point.

00:05:09,156 --> 00:05:11,955
I wanna help you bring what you being to the table here,

00:05:11,955 --> 00:05:13,960
your strengths, your fears, your weaknesses,

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,633
all the things that you wanna share with the world.

00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,278
So again, there's a lot more to be said

00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,741
about public speaking than what I'm gonna cover today,

00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:24,003
so I've chosen a few points that are relevant

00:05:24,003 --> 00:05:25,491
for the kinds of talks that you might wanna give.

00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,465
So, we're gonna talk about finding the right words to say,

00:05:28,465 --> 00:05:30,138
and how to practice them.

00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:32,118
We're gonna spend a lot of time talking about feedback

00:05:32,118 --> 00:05:35,027
because it's crucial not just for these spotlight moments,

00:05:35,027 --> 00:05:36,593
and then we'll cover how to prep for your spotlight moment,

00:05:36,593 --> 00:05:40,458
and then we'll talk about celebrating it.

00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,946
What you choose to focus on in your talk

00:05:41,946 --> 00:05:43,571
is the product of many things:

00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:45,431
the content that inspires you;

00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:46,863
the level of depth you're comfortable sharing;

00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:48,794
and what you learn as you take your topic

00:05:48,794 --> 00:05:50,974
for a test spin with others.

00:05:50,974 --> 00:05:52,390
At the end of the day, what we're aiming for

00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,724
is a fruitful topic that you feel

00:05:54,724 --> 00:05:58,378
really comfortable giving a talk about.

00:05:58,378 --> 00:05:59,331
So, let's talk about how to brainstorm

00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:01,726
from the work that you're already doing day-to-day.

00:06:01,726 --> 00:06:04,388
In my case, I was doing lots of web performance work,

00:06:04,388 --> 00:06:06,506
I was speeding up company websites.

00:06:06,506 --> 00:06:07,855
And I started to tell co-workers

00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:11,256
about how fast I'd made the mobile version of the site.

00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:12,089
And then I started practicing

00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:13,591
talkin' to my boss and other higher-ups,

00:06:13,591 --> 00:06:15,988
again, kind of like informal conversations.

00:06:15,988 --> 00:06:18,594
Workshopping the idea of how we were doing this work,

00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:21,436
and how it was actually making an impact for our customers.

00:06:21,436 --> 00:06:23,645
I started to write about it on the company blog,

00:06:23,645 --> 00:06:26,077
and then through writing and having these conversations,

00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:28,405
I got more comfortable building up a narrative,

00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:29,402
building up a thesis statement.

00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:31,452
What was the point I was trying to make?

00:06:31,452 --> 00:06:33,614
What were those questions that I was fielding,

00:06:33,614 --> 00:06:36,056
other than in blog comments, or just from my boss?

00:06:36,056 --> 00:06:36,996
And how could I address those

00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:40,252
that I kept on iterating on this topic?

00:06:40,252 --> 00:06:42,432
So, what do you spend large amounts of your day

00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:43,769
thinking about, or working on?

00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:46,451
Large projects are great sources of inspiration,

00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:48,716
because they feature so many facets

00:06:48,716 --> 00:06:50,374
that you could shine up for a talk.

00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:52,745
No matter what facet you choose to tools,

00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,921
or human stuff, or problem-solving,

00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:56,650
your future audience has probably felt,

00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,720
or can identify with a number of those challenges.

00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,769
So, maybe you wanna give a how-to

00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:04,019
on how you learned to code for a project,

00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:07,293
or walk through how you chose one tool over others.

00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,854
Maybe your project received feedback

00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:10,607
from stakeholders at the time, and you wanna share

00:07:10,607 --> 00:07:13,251
how you wanna get buy-in earlier next time.

00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:14,257
Or maybe you'll talk about

00:07:14,257 --> 00:07:15,688
initial bottlenecks to your project,

00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:18,286
like deciding on and coordinating an approach

00:07:18,286 --> 00:07:20,950
that works for all of the teams that were involved.

00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,288
Each of these possible topics contains a relatable story,

00:07:24,288 --> 00:07:26,279
an inspiration, a demonstration,

00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,320
or a new approach for someone in your audience.

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,977
I do wanna highlight that your topic

00:07:31,977 --> 00:07:34,486
doesn't have to be the most inspiring,

00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:36,186
thought leader-ing idea in the universe.

00:07:36,186 --> 00:07:38,362
So, even though I've branched-out into speaking on

00:07:38,362 --> 00:07:40,384
deeper and more technical topics,

00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:42,184
I know that audiences get the most

00:07:42,184 --> 00:07:45,166
out of my inter-level talks, because most often

00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,883
that content is entirely new to them.

00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,893
I find that they're super-engaged during Q and A,

00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:51,113
and they highly rate my talks that are 101 level

00:07:51,113 --> 00:07:53,198
after the conference concludes.

00:07:53,198 --> 00:07:55,915
So please remember, inter-level or 101 level talks

00:07:55,915 --> 00:07:58,835
they're a terrific way to gain practice.

00:07:58,835 --> 00:08:00,949
The information often applies to

00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:02,123
a broader spectrum of job roles,

00:08:02,123 --> 00:08:04,226
so people wanted to learn this stuff,

00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:07,012
and they're versatile and they can be tweaked per audience.

00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:08,600
And also, conferences are generally eager

00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,998
to have this foundational knowledge

00:08:09,998 --> 00:08:13,934
to set the stage for future talks to come.

00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:16,104
All right, so this is the section of the talk

00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:17,653
that covers people who have fears

00:08:17,653 --> 00:08:21,498
about fumbling your words, or being boring, or rambling.

00:08:21,498 --> 00:08:23,884
So, creating a solid structure of your content

00:08:23,884 --> 00:08:26,839
is the best way to guide your audience thought that topic.

00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,997
Structure helps set the expectations for what's next,

00:08:29,997 --> 00:08:31,061
helps strengthens your arguments,

00:08:31,061 --> 00:08:33,300
and helps keep folks more engaged.

00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,510
It also gives you a foothold if you are worried

00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:39,219
about losing your train of thought.

00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,621
So, while not a requirement,

00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:44,005
juiciness is an angle to consider as you vet your topic.

00:08:44,005 --> 00:08:46,320
A good hook is gonna help your odds

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,262
make it through that conference proposal process.

00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:52,489
Sample juicy aspects and scenarios might include

00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:54,556
timeliness or newness, so is this technology,

00:08:54,556 --> 00:08:55,914
or an approach to your work,

00:08:55,914 --> 00:08:58,370
the kind of thing that's hotly-debated online?

00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,761
Are you providing new data on how tool X-Y-Z

00:09:00,761 --> 00:09:05,110
is a much better tool than A-B-C in certain conditions?

00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,537
Or were you tasked with making big decisions

00:09:07,537 --> 00:09:10,039
that were fairly political like requiring someone

00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,694
to overhaul their design work flows?

00:09:12,694 --> 00:09:13,570
Or getting buy-inners

00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,317
to a mobile strategy for the first time.

00:09:16,317 --> 00:09:18,015
Or were the lessons that you learned during your work

00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:21,084
counterintuitive, or contrary to best practices.

00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:23,595
So as an example, at Etsy we ended up finding

00:09:23,595 --> 00:09:25,590
that continuous scrolling

00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,525
converted really poorly for our users,

00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,154
we implemented pagination.

00:09:29,154 --> 00:09:29,987
Which is not something

00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,878
I've ever seen another e-commerce company do,

00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:34,376
and it was really helpful for us to talk about how

00:09:34,376 --> 00:09:36,126
we kind of went against the grain of best practices

00:09:36,126 --> 00:09:37,877
because it was found best for our users,

00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,702
it was a juicy topic.

00:09:39,702 --> 00:09:41,579
So, if you have a solution to something

00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:43,417
that might be efficient,

00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,605
but also might flabbergast some folks,

00:09:45,605 --> 00:09:48,855
definitely consider that for juiciness.

00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,562
When we get nervous we often try to jump

00:09:51,562 --> 00:09:53,989
right into what it is that we're trying to communicate.

00:09:53,989 --> 00:09:55,863
But it's important to set expectations at the top

00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:58,629
for why am I here in this spotlight?

00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:00,949
So, even before you jump into your narrative structure,

00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:03,949
or your thesis, make sure it's clear to folks in the room,

00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:04,952
what are you gonna cover?

00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:06,869
Why this is important to you or to them?

00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:09,644
What do you hope that they will walk away with?

00:10:09,644 --> 00:10:11,785
By setting expectations up front, your audience,

00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:14,332
no matter how big or small, will be primed

00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:16,040
for what it is that you wanna say next.

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,802
You'll open their ears and their brain,

00:10:17,802 --> 00:10:22,293
and you'll make it even easier for your information to land.

00:10:22,293 --> 00:10:24,156
So, as you develop your confidence structure,

00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:27,157
figure out what to include that's actionable or inspiring.

00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:29,196
What will your audience, again, your boss, your team,

00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:30,691
or a crowd in front of you,

00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:33,101
do with the information that you're sharing?

00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:35,437
Is it clear to you what their next step should be,

00:10:35,437 --> 00:10:38,553
and will it be clear to them?

00:10:38,553 --> 00:10:41,007
How much will you have to tee-up that information,

00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,604
and can you do that in the time allotted?

00:10:42,604 --> 00:10:44,437
Will you have to do a tremendous about

00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:47,705
of explaining your context before you can get to your point?

00:10:47,705 --> 00:10:49,522
There's a chance you're gonna need more than one talk,

00:10:49,522 --> 00:10:52,013
more than one meeting, a link to external info

00:10:52,013 --> 00:10:53,563
to make sure that people can understand

00:10:53,563 --> 00:10:54,827
what you're trying to communicate,

00:10:54,827 --> 00:10:57,046
and go and do some more research afterwards

00:10:57,046 --> 00:11:00,306
if they're really confused by it.

00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:02,562
I also wanted to like take a moment and just highlight

00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:03,660
the stuff that I'm talking about,

00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,244
like setting an agenda at the top

00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:07,424
and making sure everybody has shared context.

00:11:07,424 --> 00:11:08,956
This is a tremendously meta-experience

00:11:08,956 --> 00:11:10,920
to be talking about public speaking,

00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,805
so I apologize to other speakers you'll see in the future,

00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:16,819
you'll probably be analyzing them and me right now,

00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:17,652
with how well we're doing

00:11:17,652 --> 00:11:20,184
the kinds of things that I'm talking about.

00:11:20,184 --> 00:11:22,486
So, let's talk about structure.

00:11:22,486 --> 00:11:23,846
This could look like telling a story

00:11:23,846 --> 00:11:26,553
to get your point across, or like a thesis statement

00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,893
supported by a bunch of arguments.

00:11:28,893 --> 00:11:30,877
Once you have that main nugget you'd like to communicate,

00:11:30,877 --> 00:11:33,512
think about what you'll need to back it up and make it land.

00:11:33,512 --> 00:11:35,199
So, I'm gonna walk through

00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:36,805
basically the structure I'm using today,

00:11:36,805 --> 00:11:38,890
again, that thing of being really meta,

00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,637
but the structure I generally like to use for my talk topic.

00:11:41,637 --> 00:11:44,336
So, I start with a landscape, so here's what exists:

00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:48,336
for web performance it was sites are slow often.

00:11:49,462 --> 00:11:51,019
The analysis is "Here's what I see."

00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:53,046
So, in a case of web performance, I can say like,

00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:53,879
"The sites are slow,

00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,307
"and I've noticed this is bad for users,"

00:11:56,307 --> 00:12:01,029
or there are studies that are here that back up my point.

00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:04,489
My problem statements are, "At the core is this issue.

00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:06,431
"Here's some options for what we could do about it."

00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:07,611
I like to list a bunch of options

00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:09,507
that people won't even want to include,

00:12:09,507 --> 00:12:11,099
that way I can prove why my point,

00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:13,345
my option that I'm suggesting is the best.

00:12:13,345 --> 00:12:16,582
So, here's the best option, and why it works.

00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:17,992
Here's why you should believe me.

00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:21,162
And my favorite part is why does this concept matter to you,

00:12:21,162 --> 00:12:23,855
even if it's irrelevant to your particular day-to-day job?

00:12:23,855 --> 00:12:25,757
So within the context of web performance,

00:12:25,757 --> 00:12:28,766
I would often say, let's say you have to get

00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:30,371
buy-in at your company to do something

00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:31,512
that people don't wanna do.

00:12:31,512 --> 00:12:33,878
I can talk about it in the context of web performance,

00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,426
it's important to get my company to care about site speed,

00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:38,662
but maybe web performance isn't the thing for you.

00:12:38,662 --> 00:12:40,353
Maybe it's getting translations,

00:12:40,353 --> 00:12:42,617
maybe it's mobile development, something else.

00:12:42,617 --> 00:12:44,288
I make sure I cover something along these lines,

00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:46,829
to make sure that there's this bigger idea at the end.

00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:48,795
So in this narrative structure,

00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:51,742
we are kind of here now, and we're also kind of here,

00:12:51,742 --> 00:12:52,861
you'll see that I'll weave

00:12:52,861 --> 00:12:54,968
back and forth through this topic.

00:12:54,968 --> 00:12:56,429
I've built this talk so it resonates

00:12:56,429 --> 00:12:57,656
with different kinds of people

00:12:57,656 --> 00:13:00,449
struggling with different kinds of needs, or fears,

00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:02,643
and also different kinds of spotlights.

00:13:02,643 --> 00:13:04,093
So, once I determine that my point was

00:13:04,093 --> 00:13:06,348
that we all can and should be able to

00:13:06,348 --> 00:13:07,566
use our fears about public speaking

00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:09,642
to push us towards that spotlight,

00:13:09,642 --> 00:13:12,073
I workshop this narrative around it to support it.

00:13:12,073 --> 00:13:14,105
In this case also, I specifically tried to find out

00:13:14,105 --> 00:13:15,600
what needs Mozilla has,

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,855
and what would be most beneficial to you to talk about?

00:13:17,855 --> 00:13:18,688
And again, I workshopped

00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:22,124
this narrative structure around that.

00:13:22,124 --> 00:13:23,674
So, once I have the basic structure nailed down,

00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:25,363
I iterated on that narrative to make sure

00:13:25,363 --> 00:13:28,080
it wasn't just a dry list of information.

00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,816
Because just saying words at you

00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:31,623
doesn't mean it's gonna land.

00:13:31,623 --> 00:13:33,700
You could list your work to your boss,

00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,848
and hope that they just understand

00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,127
that's why you deserve a promotion,

00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,519
but you know you need to do a better job than that.

00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,424
So, let's talk through the stuff we can do

00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:42,064
to level-up our content,

00:13:42,064 --> 00:13:43,583
to make sure it's not just informational,

00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,166
but has that chance of landing.

00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,413
You may think it's smart to tell a joke.

00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:51,840
Firstly, jokes are terrifying,

00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,944
don't feel like you have to be funny, just be yourself.

00:13:54,944 --> 00:13:57,939
But in the drier parts of any talks that I'm giving,

00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:00,138
I'll see what I can incorporate to spice things up.

00:14:00,138 --> 00:14:01,964
In this picture I'm telling a story

00:14:01,964 --> 00:14:04,730
of when I didn't document an icon font well.

00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,712
This was a whole narrative about editing fonts

00:14:07,712 --> 00:14:10,041
to make sure that the site loads fast.

00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,908
And my part of that web fonts was really boring,

00:14:11,908 --> 00:14:14,930
it was very tactical, so what I started to do

00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:18,170
was tell a story about how we had this bug in Etsy,

00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,142
it was an icon font bug.

00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:22,323
Instead of the half star GLIF,

00:14:22,323 --> 00:14:25,776
IOS was choosing what it thought was the next closest icon,

00:14:25,776 --> 00:14:27,693
which in our case was a horse head.

00:14:27,693 --> 00:14:29,376
This actually showed up for a bunch of our users,

00:14:29,376 --> 00:14:32,463
and it caused maybe the most hilarious bug in Etsy history.

00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:34,191
So, I didn't need to tell that story,

00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:37,635
it wasn't entirely relevant about how to make fonts fast,

00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:39,288
but it definitely was relevant enough

00:14:39,288 --> 00:14:41,006
that it was able to carry my story through,

00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,411
so I was able to keep folks laughing and engaged.

00:14:43,411 --> 00:14:46,120
I laughed and that makes me a better presenter.

00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,391
People are more likely to listen to me

00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:49,167
when I'm smiling and laughing on stage, right?

00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,250
So, telling this story helped make sure

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,364
that stuff was landing

00:14:52,364 --> 00:14:56,044
and people would stay awake for the rest of my talk.

00:14:56,044 --> 00:14:57,890
So, I do this throughout my spotlight moments,

00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,447
it can be subtle and secret,

00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:01,549
like adding a Post-it Note to your laptop when you open it,

00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:03,301
with a message from your partner.

00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:04,833
Or a picture of someone or something,

00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:08,413
like Buttercup the sloth, that makes you smile.

00:15:08,413 --> 00:15:10,809
I recommend trying to weave it into your narrative

00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,266
as appropriately as possible, again,

00:15:12,266 --> 00:15:14,378
we don't wanna distract our audience.

00:15:14,378 --> 00:15:15,806
So, when I talked about that horse head,

00:15:15,806 --> 00:15:17,393
or these pictures of sloths,

00:15:17,393 --> 00:15:18,835
I make sure that I'm grinning and laughing,

00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,918
but also not distracting my audience.

00:15:23,452 --> 00:15:25,641
Again, when I do these things it's important

00:15:25,641 --> 00:15:27,265
to make sure that we're incorporating humor,

00:15:27,265 --> 00:15:29,858
or imagery, or other things, not just aren't distracting,

00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:31,760
but also aren't triggering to folks.

00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,296
The last thing you wanna do is alienate folks

00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:36,968
by using a meme, or some sort of imagery

00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:39,501
that's gonna be triggering or distracting to folks.

00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:41,403
I wanna make sure you're double-checking this stuff,

00:15:41,403 --> 00:15:44,969
so I often run all of my presentation slides and images

00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:46,866
past a bunch of co-workers and just gut check.

00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:47,949
Does this make sense?

00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:48,996
Is this distracting?

00:15:48,996 --> 00:15:49,829
Might this be triggering?

00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:52,234
Might I not know the history of this meme?

00:15:52,234 --> 00:15:54,922
Those are all good questions to be asking yourself.

00:15:54,922 --> 00:15:57,935
I also wanna highlight that you have this soapbox,

00:15:57,935 --> 00:15:59,378
and you should be using the soapbox for good

00:15:59,378 --> 00:16:00,899
when you're getting up on stage.

00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,652
Make sure that you are not just using

00:16:02,652 --> 00:16:04,684
a homogenist group of images.

00:16:04,684 --> 00:16:06,057
There's tons of resources out there

00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:07,396
to make sure you're using images

00:16:07,396 --> 00:16:09,551
of a diversitive humans, doing diversitive things

00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,736
or diversitive animals doing diversitive things.

00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:14,362
Because you know, again, we have this soapbox,

00:16:14,362 --> 00:16:18,625
we should be using it for good and inclusively.

00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,815
Speaking about inclusiveness,

00:16:19,815 --> 00:16:23,453
triple-check that your content is easy to see and to scan.

00:16:23,453 --> 00:16:25,248
Your audience shouldn't be spending more energy

00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:27,945
parsing tiny or low-contrast text,

00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,711
rather than listening to your message.

00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:32,232
So, pay attention to type bases and colors,

00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:34,011
too many of either can distract your audience.

00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:36,116
And use color accessibility tools,

00:16:36,116 --> 00:16:39,614
you can check color contrast and also sizes of fonts

00:16:39,614 --> 00:16:40,996
to make sure that everything that you're doing

00:16:40,996 --> 00:16:42,224
is readable with people

00:16:42,224 --> 00:16:45,929
who have low visual needs, or are blind.

00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:47,654
So taking steps to improve readability

00:16:47,654 --> 00:16:49,567
can help everybody in your audience.

00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:51,134
Test your slides from a distance,

00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:52,968
sit in the back of the room that you're practicing in,

00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:55,390
and make sure that on any projector

00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,612
it'll still be able to be read.

00:16:58,612 --> 00:17:00,046
So next, take it for a test drive,

00:17:00,046 --> 00:17:02,587
make sure it resonates with others.

00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:04,188
I usually, again, start out by writing.

00:17:04,188 --> 00:17:06,441
I will write a blog post, or a series of blog posts

00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:08,226
to kind of iterate on my thought process

00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:09,749
for a future presentation.

00:17:09,749 --> 00:17:10,678
I won't make it explicit

00:17:10,678 --> 00:17:12,004
that it's for a future presentation,

00:17:12,004 --> 00:17:14,552
but I'll open up to comments or to Twitter questions,

00:17:14,552 --> 00:17:16,257
and I'll see what I get back.

00:17:16,257 --> 00:17:17,090
I was trying to start and notice

00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,384
which stuff resonated the most?

00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:20,211
Which quotes were Tweeted the most?

00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:22,076
What were people asking me questions about?

00:17:22,076 --> 00:17:23,039
Can I make sure that I'm clarifying

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,534
that again in the future?

00:17:24,534 --> 00:17:26,451
Doing this process of writing and sharing online

00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:28,667
is helpful to me, and it may be helpful to you

00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,786
if you do enjoy writing.

00:17:30,786 --> 00:17:33,032
If you don't, consider giving a mini-presentation,

00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:34,112
like over the water cooler,

00:17:34,112 --> 00:17:37,065
or talking in a meeting that you have about this talk topic.

00:17:37,065 --> 00:17:38,870
Start to talk about it, ask people questions,

00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,232
see if the word choice that you're using

00:17:40,232 --> 00:17:43,040
is making sense, and iterate on it that way.

00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,545
So, as I started writing the first draft of this slide deck,

00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:47,897
I shared it with a few organizers

00:17:47,897 --> 00:17:50,313
of meet-ups and conferences, and also Havi,

00:17:50,313 --> 00:17:51,697
to get their feedback.

00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:53,238
I wanted to hear which aspects of it

00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,333
would resonate with their audiences.

00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,622
And then, after I had a better idea

00:17:57,622 --> 00:17:59,043
of how my thesis could be framed,

00:17:59,043 --> 00:18:01,762
or what kind of examples I could use to support my point,

00:18:01,762 --> 00:18:03,028
I iterated on the basic outline

00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:06,945
until I was ready to start doing some dry runs.

00:18:09,191 --> 00:18:11,346
Almost all of the fears that I hear from speakers

00:18:11,346 --> 00:18:12,524
who are both experienced,

00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:15,468
and also people who are inexperienced,

00:18:15,468 --> 00:18:17,792
I think that most all of these fears can be alleviated

00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:20,202
with a healthy amount of preparation and practice.

00:18:20,202 --> 00:18:22,148
Whether you're afraid of saying something wrong,

00:18:22,148 --> 00:18:24,023
or missing the mark on what the audience wants,

00:18:24,023 --> 00:18:25,843
or fumbling on stage, again,

00:18:25,843 --> 00:18:27,378
most of all of this can be alleviated

00:18:27,378 --> 00:18:29,390
with some amount of prep.

00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,714
Build in enough time to make sure

00:18:30,714 --> 00:18:31,907
that you have space and time

00:18:31,907 --> 00:18:34,055
to work things out with far less stress.

00:18:34,055 --> 00:18:35,094
No matter what the venue,

00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:38,847
practice plenty before you're in that spotlight.

00:18:38,847 --> 00:18:40,171
I also wanna highlight that rehearsing

00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:42,083
is an extremely personal endeavor,

00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,642
and my best advice is to start by

00:18:43,642 --> 00:18:46,447
focusing on just one aspect at a time.

00:18:46,447 --> 00:18:48,242
So, when you think about being in that spotlight,

00:18:48,242 --> 00:18:50,709
which part feels the most unfamiliar?

00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:54,394
How confident, do you know what to do with your hands?

00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:55,685
How confident are you that you can

00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:58,251
stay on track with your audience in a prepared narrative?

00:18:58,251 --> 00:19:00,539
So adopt a method that allows you to rehearse and practice

00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,932
just the little bits and pieces

00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,982
that feel the most unfamiliar.

00:19:03,982 --> 00:19:05,468
So for this talk, I wanted to make sure

00:19:05,468 --> 00:19:07,837
that the flow of the content made sense,

00:19:07,837 --> 00:19:09,620
I didn't jump around a bunch.

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,453
So when I practiced,

00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:12,638
I paid special attention to making sure I was

00:19:12,638 --> 00:19:16,449
building the information in a way that flowed.

00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:17,558
And once you have those different,

00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:19,517
individual pieces feeling good,

00:19:19,517 --> 00:19:22,443
move on to practicing what you wanna say in its entirety.

00:19:22,443 --> 00:19:24,551
Lots of folks instinctively stop

00:19:24,551 --> 00:19:26,139
when they mess-up during a run-through.

00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:27,894
We'll fumble our wording, or something,

00:19:27,894 --> 00:19:30,658
and we'll stop and we'll have that little voice in our head

00:19:30,658 --> 00:19:32,512
that just wants us to wallow for a minute.

00:19:32,512 --> 00:19:34,912
We just wanna be like, "Ugh, why can't I do this?

00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:36,854
"This feels horrible," or whatever it is.

00:19:36,854 --> 00:19:39,620
We don't that instinct naturally to push on through,

00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,767
and recover from that fumble,

00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:43,564
but that is the most crucial part to practice.

00:19:43,564 --> 00:19:46,476
You can't get stuck there, practice making that fumble,

00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,309
and getting through it.

00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:48,729
That way you have the confidence

00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,011
once you get up in that spotlight,

00:19:50,011 --> 00:19:50,869
that you'll be able to make it through

00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:55,153
another fumble like that, if it happens in real life.

00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,527
All right so, you've done this practice by yourself,

00:19:57,527 --> 00:19:59,563
you've rehearsed a little bit, hopefully you've gone through

00:19:59,563 --> 00:20:01,325
the whole thing a bunch of times.

00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,058
We're gonna spend a lot of time

00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:07,891
practicing in front of others, and getting some feedback.

00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:09,780
Before we get into this larger practice run,

00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,022
I wanna take a moment and point out

00:20:11,022 --> 00:20:13,970
that receiving feedback is the worst.

00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,062
Humans are mostly bad at giving feedback,

00:20:16,062 --> 00:20:17,146
we're also really bad

00:20:17,146 --> 00:20:20,514
at preparing ourselves to receive feedback,

00:20:20,514 --> 00:20:22,250
this is true no matter the situation.

00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,596
Hearing that we do something at home

00:20:23,596 --> 00:20:25,632
that drives our partner crazy, or our co-worker,

00:20:25,632 --> 00:20:29,545
or our boss, and most of us are paralyzed by the fear

00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:31,974
of having these awkward conversations.

00:20:31,974 --> 00:20:33,767
We actively avoid asking for feedback

00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:36,506
because it's just so painful sometimes.

00:20:36,506 --> 00:20:39,084
Or, we'll go out of our way to give nonspecific,

00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:41,157
just generic feedback, sometimes what we like to call

00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,180
compliment sandwiches like, "You look great today,

00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,020
"that talk you gave was really boring,

00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,853
"but you're really smart!"

00:20:46,853 --> 00:20:47,687
That's a compliment sandwich,

00:20:47,687 --> 00:20:50,985
we wanna avoid doing those things.

00:20:50,985 --> 00:20:52,936
In this section I wanna help encourage you

00:20:52,936 --> 00:20:55,761
to overcome your fear of asking for feedback,

00:20:55,761 --> 00:20:58,471
and to help others give you actually specific,

00:20:58,471 --> 00:21:01,369
actually actionable feedback.

00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:02,660
I'm gonna keep on using this example

00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,181
of giving a practice run for a conference talk,

00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,553
but I'm hoping that these tactics

00:21:06,553 --> 00:21:08,618
will help you in all different areas of your life

00:21:08,618 --> 00:21:11,877
that feedback comes into play.

00:21:11,877 --> 00:21:13,861
First, pick that crew of people

00:21:13,861 --> 00:21:16,861
that you wanna rely on to give you good feedback.

00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:19,287
I like to limit this at first to three or four people,

00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:20,974
and it's helpful if they're people who you know

00:21:20,974 --> 00:21:22,364
are already good at giving feedback,

00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,477
not just people who will tell you what you wanna hear,

00:21:24,477 --> 00:21:27,062
because that's not gonna help us out at all.

00:21:27,062 --> 00:21:28,365
Pick people who either are

00:21:28,365 --> 00:21:30,709
familiar with your future audience,

00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:31,579
they have some context about

00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:32,912
what those folks are interested in,

00:21:32,912 --> 00:21:34,510
or the knowledge that they already have,

00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,672
or the questions that they might be asking you.

00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:37,964
Or pick co-workers

00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,450
that are really familiar with your topic

00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,939
that you know you wanna speak on.

00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:43,402
They'll be able to help you come up with

00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,998
super-strange, aggressive, weird audience questions

00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:48,115
to help you practice.

00:21:48,115 --> 00:21:50,282
Or people who you know

00:21:50,282 --> 00:21:52,490
and you trust you can feel safe around,

00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:57,224
who can eventually give you some really helpful feedback.

00:21:57,224 --> 00:22:00,004
The obvious choice for getting feedback is in person,

00:22:00,004 --> 00:22:02,104
but if practicing in front of people

00:22:02,104 --> 00:22:03,260
is less than comfortable,

00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,160
but you'd still like feedback on narrative,

00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,225
word choice, or some other non-body language stuff,

00:22:08,225 --> 00:22:11,113
consider also recording a dry run privately,

00:22:11,113 --> 00:22:13,478
and then getting asynchronous feedback from your crew.

00:22:13,478 --> 00:22:15,583
So, my co-worker practices alone,

00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,419
records his talk on his computer,

00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,014
and then sends it to others to get their thoughts via email,

00:22:20,014 --> 00:22:21,375
this lets him dedicate time and focus

00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,050
to each step of the process.

00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,392
Practicing, and rehearsing, and recording that,

00:22:25,392 --> 00:22:29,059
and then separately receiving that feedback.

00:22:30,661 --> 00:22:32,507
But if you choose to practice your words in person,

00:22:32,507 --> 00:22:34,961
this is your chance to gather nonverbal feedback,

00:22:34,961 --> 00:22:36,654
and practice reading the room.

00:22:36,654 --> 00:22:38,611
This is a photo of two audience members

00:22:38,611 --> 00:22:40,314
during one of my conference talks.

00:22:40,314 --> 00:22:43,096
I hope you all feel as engaged right now as they look,

00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:44,598
I really wish I knew what I was saying

00:22:44,598 --> 00:22:47,987
when they were staring so intently at me on stage.

00:22:47,987 --> 00:22:50,340
As you're practicing with others, watch how people respond.

00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,441
Do they laugh?

00:22:51,441 --> 00:22:53,259
Do they lean towards you and look focused?

00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:54,433
Are they nodding?

00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:55,925
Do they look confused or distracted?

00:22:55,925 --> 00:22:57,470
By tracking this kind of feedback,

00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,685
you'll develop a sense about which parts

00:22:59,685 --> 00:23:01,497
of what you're saying are more engaging,

00:23:01,497 --> 00:23:04,784
or move too quickly, or should be further workshopped.

00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:06,701
Before I move on, this slide image is really sneaky.

00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:07,755
This is, again, a real picture

00:23:07,755 --> 00:23:09,045
from a conference talk I gave,

00:23:09,045 --> 00:23:12,220
it was a keynote to about 2,000 people.

00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,656
I didn't know these two very well at the time,

00:23:13,656 --> 00:23:15,739
but the guy on the right he no longer has a mustache,

00:23:15,739 --> 00:23:17,292
but he is now my boyfriend.

00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:19,155
So when I keep this image in here,

00:23:19,155 --> 00:23:21,241
I'm like seeing him and, "Oh, look at that cutie."

00:23:21,241 --> 00:23:23,123
And I'm able to smile and feel more engaged,

00:23:23,123 --> 00:23:27,546
and I present better when this slide image is up there.

00:23:27,546 --> 00:23:29,443
It can be nerveracking to request feedback,

00:23:29,443 --> 00:23:31,844
let alone on something as personal

00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:33,818
and anxiety-inducing as public speaking.

00:23:33,818 --> 00:23:36,387
It's key to set expectations for your feedback givers,

00:23:36,387 --> 00:23:38,626
and prepare them to observe your notes.

00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,971
So, do the same for your feedback crew,

00:23:40,971 --> 00:23:43,369
give them details about the point that you wanna make,

00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:44,594
who your audience will be,

00:23:44,594 --> 00:23:47,643
and what kind of feedback you're looking for.

00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:49,639
Here are just a few examples of the kinds of things

00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:51,951
you can ask your feedback crew to think about

00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:54,145
as they listen to you practice.

00:23:54,145 --> 00:23:56,836
By priming their brains ahead of time, and cluing them in

00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:58,945
to the kinds of feedback you're looking for,

00:23:58,945 --> 00:24:00,603
you'll both equip them well to help you,

00:24:00,603 --> 00:24:01,800
and make sure you're ready

00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,095
for the kinds of things that they might say,

00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:05,928
this is because you need

00:24:05,928 --> 00:24:08,531
to prime your own brain to hear the feedback.

00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:10,441
After the run-through, thank your crew,

00:24:10,441 --> 00:24:11,898
and then take a moment to shift gears

00:24:11,898 --> 00:24:13,671
into feedback-receiving mode.

00:24:13,671 --> 00:24:15,060
Let your crew know how you'd like

00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,133
to receive their thoughts, and when.

00:24:17,133 --> 00:24:17,966
Maybe you're energized,

00:24:17,966 --> 00:24:19,619
and you're ready to receive feedback in the moment,

00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:20,512
and you just wanna high-five,

00:24:20,512 --> 00:24:22,745
and dive right into the conversation.

00:24:22,745 --> 00:24:23,741
Or maybe you're a little drained,

00:24:23,741 --> 00:24:25,767
and you don't wanna receive feedback just yet.

00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:26,937
So, I wanna remind you,

00:24:26,937 --> 00:24:29,708
it's absolutely okay to request comments separately

00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:31,499
and in a different medium.

00:24:31,499 --> 00:24:32,555
Ask people to email you,

00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:34,947
ask people to talk it over coffee later,

00:24:34,947 --> 00:24:36,057
create an anonymous forum

00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,351
for them to submit feedback to you.

00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:39,198
No matter what helps you feel better

00:24:39,198 --> 00:24:40,489
and more equipped to hear their feedback,

00:24:40,489 --> 00:24:41,824
tee that up for yourself.

00:24:41,824 --> 00:24:42,894
Remember, your feedback crew

00:24:42,894 --> 00:24:44,740
will want to help and support you,

00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:48,987
they wanna do this in as easy way for you as possible.

00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,483
As an aside while we're talking about prepping our brains,

00:24:51,483 --> 00:24:54,272
I wanna call up out useful tip I've picked up along the way

00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:57,988
as I've given anybody feedback, it's called the micro-yes.

00:24:57,988 --> 00:24:59,408
If you wanna give someone feedback,

00:24:59,408 --> 00:25:01,662
either in a prepared setting or just randomly,

00:25:01,662 --> 00:25:04,396
one way to make sure that they're brain is open to hear it

00:25:04,396 --> 00:25:05,551
is to ask them,

00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:07,937
"Hey, is this a good time to give you some feedback?"

00:25:07,937 --> 00:25:09,087
They'll probably say yes,

00:25:09,087 --> 00:25:10,547
nine times out of 10 they'll say yes,

00:25:10,547 --> 00:25:11,659
and that act of saying yes

00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:14,206
triggers an immediate physiological reaction

00:25:14,206 --> 00:25:15,287
that helps them brace themselves

00:25:15,287 --> 00:25:16,617
for what you're about to say.

00:25:16,617 --> 00:25:19,512
So, getting that micro-yes primes us in the most subtle way

00:25:19,512 --> 00:25:21,618
to absorb what we're about to hear.

00:25:21,618 --> 00:25:22,582
I promise, try it, it really works,

00:25:22,582 --> 00:25:24,519
especially of you're a manager, or worse,

00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:26,299
you have to give feedback to your manager.

00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:27,675
Just say, "Hey, I've got some feedback,

00:25:27,675 --> 00:25:29,589
"is now an okay time to share it with you?"

00:25:29,589 --> 00:25:31,006
It works wonders.

00:25:33,378 --> 00:25:37,138
Have you ever had someone tell you, "You did a great job"?

00:25:37,138 --> 00:25:39,073
If feels good for like 30 seconds.

00:25:39,073 --> 00:25:42,167
You're like, "Oh yeah, thanks, it did feel pretty good."

00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,473
But then you might start to wonder,

00:25:43,473 --> 00:25:44,739
"What about that was good?"

00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:46,696
Or like, "Was there anything that wasn't good?"

00:25:46,696 --> 00:25:48,026
Or like, "What should I keep on doing,

00:25:48,026 --> 00:25:49,666
"or doing better in the future?"

00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:53,288
What we crave is feedback that will actually help us grow,

00:25:53,288 --> 00:25:54,692
something to help our message land,

00:25:54,692 --> 00:25:56,639
or for us to have more of an impact,

00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:59,542
or to know specifically what it is that people value.

00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:00,375
So, let's talk about getting

00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:03,415
that kind of feedback from folks.

00:26:03,415 --> 00:26:05,702
A company called LifeLabs developed a way for us

00:26:05,702 --> 00:26:08,514
to think about feedback that uses suits of cards.

00:26:08,514 --> 00:26:09,347
This is cheesy,

00:26:09,347 --> 00:26:11,763
but this really helps you direct your feedback crew

00:26:11,763 --> 00:26:14,574
to give you actionable and specific feedback later.

00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:16,533
So, we're looking at general,

00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,004
and then specific and actionable feedback,

00:26:18,004 --> 00:26:19,517
positive and also negative.

00:26:19,517 --> 00:26:22,481
Hearts is feedback that's positive, but not specific.

00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:24,408
Something like, "I really liked your talk,"

00:26:24,408 --> 00:26:27,541
or "You look great today," that's a heart.

00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:29,246
Diamonds is feedback that's positive,

00:26:29,246 --> 00:26:31,133
but also specific or actionable.

00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:33,307
So something like, "I thought your talk was funny,

00:26:33,307 --> 00:26:34,683
"especially this joke you made,"

00:26:34,683 --> 00:26:36,580
or "I really liked that example that you used,

00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,106
"it helped me engage better," that's a diamond.

00:26:40,106 --> 00:26:41,692
Clubs is feedback that's negative,

00:26:41,692 --> 00:26:43,918
but not specific or constructive like,

00:26:43,918 --> 00:26:46,379
"I thought your talk was boring," that's a Club,

00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:48,119
I hope you all never hear that.

00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:50,529
Spades though, is feedback that's negative,

00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:52,985
but also provides specific suggestions, so like,

00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:55,191
"My mind started to wander when you were

00:26:55,191 --> 00:26:57,493
"talking through the code, I wonder if you could shorten it,

00:26:57,493 --> 00:26:58,396
"or provide a better visual

00:26:58,396 --> 00:27:01,023
"to help keep the audience more engaged."

00:27:01,023 --> 00:27:02,493
That's a fantastic Spade,

00:27:02,493 --> 00:27:05,113
we wanna move into the specific and actionable.

00:27:05,113 --> 00:27:07,065
I recommend using this for any and all feedback

00:27:07,065 --> 00:27:10,403
you ever need to receive or deliver,

00:27:10,403 --> 00:27:12,370
focus on and ask for the specific and actionable,

00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,228
the Diamonds and the Spades.

00:27:14,228 --> 00:27:15,394
Also, if you're practicing

00:27:15,394 --> 00:27:17,397
outside of the Masterclass program,

00:27:17,397 --> 00:27:18,838
I would definitely recommend

00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:20,099
sharing this feedback with others,

00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:22,676
I've seen it used in many strange,

00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:26,932
not-presentation format that it worked beautifully.

00:27:26,932 --> 00:27:29,894
Part of what makes Diamond and Spades feedback so valuable

00:27:29,894 --> 00:27:31,847
is that focus on the actionable item,

00:27:31,847 --> 00:27:34,259
it gives you something specific to respond to.

00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:37,053
So, if your feedback crew is sharing more Hearts or Clubs,

00:27:37,053 --> 00:27:38,620
you can use open questions,

00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,225
that's questions that can't be answered with a yes or a no,

00:27:41,225 --> 00:27:44,407
to turn their feedback back towards the concrete.

00:27:44,407 --> 00:27:46,317
For example, "Can you help me understand

00:27:46,317 --> 00:27:48,032
"why I should include a code example?"

00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:50,433
Or, "What specifically about that felt boring?"

00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:53,441
Or, "How could I make this more powerful?"

00:27:53,441 --> 00:27:56,092
I also wanna iterate, emphasize now that

00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:56,966
it's gonna be strange to hear me

00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,593
be at this part of the presentation,

00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,300
but not all feedback is valuable.

00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,632
You know, probably, your audience best,

00:28:02,632 --> 00:28:04,914
you know the message that you wanna deliver,

00:28:04,914 --> 00:28:06,856
and you also should remember that not all feedback

00:28:06,856 --> 00:28:08,422
needs to be incorporated.

00:28:08,422 --> 00:28:10,694
Hopefully you've cultivated a feedback crew

00:28:10,694 --> 00:28:12,209
that you can count on to provide

00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:14,156
thoughtful and honest critique,

00:28:14,156 --> 00:28:15,853
but responses are also subjective.

00:28:15,853 --> 00:28:18,183
I think that we all know that when we receive feedback

00:28:18,183 --> 00:28:20,578
it's often more about the feedback giver

00:28:20,578 --> 00:28:22,287
than the feedback receiver.

00:28:22,287 --> 00:28:23,600
So remember, as you hear feedback,

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,608
either use open questions to help them

00:28:25,608 --> 00:28:27,497
turn that feedback into more actionable,

00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,089
concrete, specific feedback.

00:28:29,089 --> 00:28:31,618
Or just hold in your heart, and hold in your brain,

00:28:31,618 --> 00:28:33,995
"All right, that was more about them than it was about me,

00:28:33,995 --> 00:28:34,901
"I'll figure out how and if

00:28:34,901 --> 00:28:37,920
"I should incorporate this later."

00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,090
All right, so let's do this.

00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,417
You figured out what it is that you wanna say,

00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:42,738
and you've found your groove in saying it,

00:28:42,738 --> 00:28:44,001
maybe you've practiced a bit,

00:28:44,001 --> 00:28:45,436
and hopefully you've gotten some feedback

00:28:45,436 --> 00:28:46,920
that will help you make your words

00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,714
and your speaking style way more impactful.

00:28:49,714 --> 00:28:51,759
The last leg of our journey is to figure out

00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:53,964
which bits of our environment we can tweak

00:28:53,964 --> 00:28:56,631
to set ourselves up for success.

00:28:57,483 --> 00:28:58,842
Think about what clothing

00:28:58,842 --> 00:29:00,145
would get you in mind for your moment,

00:29:00,145 --> 00:29:02,293
what would make you feel like a superhero?

00:29:02,293 --> 00:29:03,490
What could you wear that will make you feel

00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,856
the strongest, most secure and most grounded

00:29:05,856 --> 00:29:07,387
when you're in that spotlight?

00:29:07,387 --> 00:29:09,416
What I'm wearing right now makes me feel like myself,

00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:12,052
but like a slightly dressier version of myself.

00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:14,099
It holds up to any kind of stage lights,

00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:16,556
and if I had a battery pack clipped to me,

00:29:16,556 --> 00:29:18,127
it would still hold up to the weight of that.

00:29:18,127 --> 00:29:20,477
And it doesn't make too much sound when I move,

00:29:20,477 --> 00:29:23,305
and it also hides my hilarious flop sweat that's happening,

00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:25,846
and it looks like I'm taking this event seriously.

00:29:25,846 --> 00:29:27,994
And again, that most important fear that I have,

00:29:27,994 --> 00:29:29,384
which is that tripping and falling,

00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:31,497
I'm probably not gonna fall in these shoes.

00:29:31,497 --> 00:29:32,934
So again, think about what's gonna make you feel

00:29:32,934 --> 00:29:36,851
the most grounded when you're standing up here.

00:29:38,256 --> 00:29:42,073
That trip and fall fear is why I also emphasize to everyone

00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:44,866
get the lay of the land before you stand up and speak.

00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,322
So, before every conference talk I'll do a tech check,

00:29:47,322 --> 00:29:49,505
where I plug my laptop in and test the slides,

00:29:49,505 --> 00:29:51,389
and if possible, the remote control.

00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:52,584
You'll probably see other speakers

00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:54,750
doing this at conferences now.

00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,620
This isn't just relevant

00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,235
to people giving big presentations, though,

00:29:58,235 --> 00:29:59,596
get to live for any big moment.

00:29:59,596 --> 00:30:01,102
If you're in an uncomfortable setting,

00:30:01,102 --> 00:30:02,990
and you're not sure of where the tech setup is,

00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,916
go and check it out before hand.

00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:07,343
And if this kind of prepared talk

00:30:07,343 --> 00:30:09,479
is way out of the norm for you, take some extra time

00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:12,119
to see what if feels like to be in that spotlight.

00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:14,812
This is probably the weirdest part about conference talks,

00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:17,343
there's no way to slowly dip your toes in

00:30:17,343 --> 00:30:20,029
to knowing what it feels like to be blinded by spotlights.

00:30:20,029 --> 00:30:21,782
So if you can, if this totally,

00:30:21,782 --> 00:30:23,101
totally out of place for you,

00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:25,446
get up on stage somewhere before you have to give a talk,

00:30:25,446 --> 00:30:26,279
just like sneak up on stage,

00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:28,416
or ask the conference organizers probably,

00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:30,128
to sneak up on stage and see what it feels like.

00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,282
See if you can see the people in the audience,

00:30:32,282 --> 00:30:34,024
see what it feels like to be

00:30:34,024 --> 00:30:35,705
different distances from your laptop,

00:30:35,705 --> 00:30:37,554
see what it feels like to move around the stage.

00:30:37,554 --> 00:30:39,102
This will help you feel more comfortable

00:30:39,102 --> 00:30:41,352
when the actual time comes.

00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:44,929
One time the conference I was speaking at

00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:46,471
was completely unprepared to connect

00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:48,685
my Mac laptop to a projector.

00:30:48,685 --> 00:30:50,787
Thank goodness I had my slide deck and fonts

00:30:50,787 --> 00:30:53,119
saved to a thumb drive, I was able to

00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,054
load it up on someone else's machine.

00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:57,598
I can't tell you how much better I feel standing here

00:30:57,598 --> 00:30:59,925
knowing that I have a backup plan ready to go,

00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:02,161
saved to Dropbox if my laptop dies.

00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:03,902
I could just hand it to the excellent AV team here,

00:31:03,902 --> 00:31:05,626
and it'd be totally fine.

00:31:05,626 --> 00:31:07,895
So, if you're giving a demo of some work also remember

00:31:07,895 --> 00:31:10,146
you may not have Internet access, or it may be spotty,

00:31:10,146 --> 00:31:11,473
so have a backup plan.

00:31:11,473 --> 00:31:13,252
Record a screen cast, or something else,

00:31:13,252 --> 00:31:15,050
make sure you have a backup plan in case

00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:18,383
all of the tech situation fails for you.

00:31:19,256 --> 00:31:21,337
You may have seen me standing off to the side

00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:24,066
before I got up here, I was doing a little superman pose,

00:31:24,066 --> 00:31:27,356
which looks a little more subtle than maybe a starfish pose.

00:31:27,356 --> 00:31:29,887
These body positions, these power poses,

00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:31,362
are proven to be effective,

00:31:31,362 --> 00:31:34,591
there's a great Amy Cuddy talk, TED talk about this,

00:31:34,591 --> 00:31:36,142
it will help change your body chemicals,

00:31:36,142 --> 00:31:38,142
and get your whole body ready to get up on stage,

00:31:38,142 --> 00:31:39,116
or have a job interview,

00:31:39,116 --> 00:31:40,382
or whatever else that you need to do.

00:31:40,382 --> 00:31:43,637
So, find a corner, find a bathroom stall,

00:31:43,637 --> 00:31:46,124
get a quiet place to ready yourself for that spotlight,

00:31:46,124 --> 00:31:47,662
do whatever you need to get energized

00:31:47,662 --> 00:31:50,350
and to center yourself, then get up there.

00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:53,721
So, I'm up here, I'm doing it, I hope it's going well,

00:31:53,721 --> 00:31:56,003
I know which parts I've kind of stumbled on,

00:31:56,003 --> 00:31:57,203
I know which parts I would iterate on

00:31:57,203 --> 00:31:59,964
for future versions of this talk.

00:31:59,964 --> 00:32:02,445
I'm thinking about Q and A, I'm checkin' the time,

00:32:02,445 --> 00:32:05,202
there's a whole bunch of things that are happening up here.

00:32:05,202 --> 00:32:08,716
I'd be happy to also answer questions, but after.

00:32:08,716 --> 00:32:09,549
After we're done though,

00:32:09,549 --> 00:32:11,233
I'm gonna take a big sigh of relief, right?

00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:13,860
Like high-five myself, maybe eat a donut.

00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,389
So, let out that breath, give a cheer,

00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:17,189
make sure you're celebrating for yourself

00:32:17,189 --> 00:32:19,377
what the big, important things it was that you just did.

00:32:19,377 --> 00:32:21,695
This is not a small feat.

00:32:21,695 --> 00:32:23,935
I remember this Raquel Velez quote,

00:32:23,935 --> 00:32:24,768
this won't be the last time

00:32:24,768 --> 00:32:27,299
you've something prepared to someone.

00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:30,468
And she says, "Talks don't define you, you define you.

00:32:30,468 --> 00:32:32,221
"Talks come and go, but every single one

00:32:32,221 --> 00:32:33,973
"will make you a better you."

00:32:33,973 --> 00:32:36,521
Remember that trust your own gut,

00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,127
do your own read on how well it went,

00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:38,960
and take notes for yourself

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,717
on what to improve for next time.

00:32:41,717 --> 00:32:42,594
Feedback from your audience

00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,504
can be exhilarating and daunting,

00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,554
so as you log people's reactions,

00:32:46,554 --> 00:32:47,947
try to focus on the constructive pieces,

00:32:47,947 --> 00:32:49,568
those Diamonds and Spades.

00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:51,752
The notes that'll make your speaking style and words

00:32:51,752 --> 00:32:53,681
even stronger in the future.

00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:56,975
Bask in all the praise, the head nods, the high-fives.

00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,524
This was from a 6th grader when I spoke at a career day,

00:32:59,524 --> 00:33:02,320
and I would call this a Heart, rather than Diamond,

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,975
but I really do appreciate that the 6th grader

00:33:03,975 --> 00:33:06,910
thought I was really fun and cool.

00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,529
So, I mentioned just a few moments ago,

00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:10,300
donuts I think are a crucial part

00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,229
of the speaking celebration process,

00:33:12,229 --> 00:33:14,322
and any career treatment celebration.

00:33:14,322 --> 00:33:16,147
Years ago I found that whenever

00:33:16,147 --> 00:33:17,752
something awesome happened in my career,

00:33:17,752 --> 00:33:20,863
maybe I got published, or promoted, or launched a project,

00:33:20,863 --> 00:33:23,673
I wouldn't take the time to celebrate the achievement.

00:33:23,673 --> 00:33:25,757
I'm an achiever by nature, I have a feeling that probably

00:33:25,757 --> 00:33:27,852
most people in this room feel this way,

00:33:27,852 --> 00:33:30,187
not deliberately marking these moments,

00:33:30,187 --> 00:33:31,139
can often make us feel like

00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:33,343
we're not making any progress in our careers.

00:33:33,343 --> 00:33:35,636
Especially with something as intangible as tech work,

00:33:35,636 --> 00:33:37,792
or getting up and speaking on stage.

00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,858
So, once I realized this was happening,

00:33:39,858 --> 00:33:41,987
I decided to be deliberate about marking achievements

00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:43,698
by eating one donut,

00:33:43,698 --> 00:33:46,404
or more than one donut if it was a really big achievement.

00:33:46,404 --> 00:33:48,469
So, the act of donut-eating has helped me feel like

00:33:48,469 --> 00:33:51,069
I'm accomplishing my career goals,

00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:52,921
because it forces me to take a minute

00:33:52,921 --> 00:33:55,278
and focus on this thing, and just sit with it,

00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:57,812
because donuts to me feel like celebration.

00:33:57,812 --> 00:33:59,285
I started to share this idea with more people,

00:33:59,285 --> 00:34:01,513
and I wrote a lot about it in the book a bunch

00:34:01,513 --> 00:34:03,125
because I really want everybody else

00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,406
to feel like you're making progress,

00:34:05,406 --> 00:34:07,018
and know that you're doing this for your own good,

00:34:07,018 --> 00:34:09,660
and knowing you're actually making progress in your career.

00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,507
So, whatever your version of a donut is,

00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,831
it's probably not a donut,

00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:16,285
I know folks that for whom a hot tub and a Margarita

00:34:16,285 --> 00:34:18,051
is their donut, it could be anything.

00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:19,481
Make sure that you're doing this for yourself

00:34:19,481 --> 00:34:21,668
after you get up and speak.

00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:23,298
All right, so we're here now.

00:34:23,298 --> 00:34:25,059
So, share your work and your knowledge,

00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:27,416
with your boss or other higher-ups, with your team,

00:34:27,416 --> 00:34:29,276
with your community, we do need your voice.

00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:31,236
We want to hear what you have to teach us,

00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,672
and we wanna learn from your work and your insight.

00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:35,234
We need a broader spectrum of voices

00:34:35,234 --> 00:34:36,878
to help us move forward as an industry.

00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:39,511
So please, use these tactics to find a spotlight,

00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:41,850
we are all here rooting for you.

00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,855
And that's it, thank you!

00:34:43,855 --> 00:34:44,961
Questions?

00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:47,500
(audience clapping)

00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,821
You've got a question box?

00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:50,422
- We sure do.

00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,409
First of all, thank you, Lara, for coming in today.

00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:53,899
We've had a couple of questions come in,

00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:56,127
so I might be reading off a few for you,

00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,149
if that's all right.

00:34:58,149 --> 00:34:59,670
First question that we've had come in is,

00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,314
"How do I as a speaker help to invoke

00:35:03,314 --> 00:35:06,370
"feedback from my audience?"

00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,614
- I'm gonna guess that this is probably

00:35:07,614 --> 00:35:09,586
during an actual big audience thing.

00:35:09,586 --> 00:35:11,192
So, there's a number of different ways

00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,960
that I've seen conferences collect feedback

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,765
from their audience members, this is a great question.

00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:18,738
Sometimes you'll have like star ratings,

00:35:18,738 --> 00:35:19,662
on like a conference website,

00:35:19,662 --> 00:35:21,912
people can submit after the talk.

00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:23,046
If I know that that's happening

00:35:23,046 --> 00:35:24,161
at the conference I'm speaking at,

00:35:24,161 --> 00:35:26,055
I will make sure before I begin, I will say,

00:35:26,055 --> 00:35:27,843
"Hey, don't forget to leave a rating,

00:35:27,843 --> 00:35:29,818
"or leave me some feedback on the conference page,"

00:35:29,818 --> 00:35:30,651
and I'll link to it,

00:35:30,651 --> 00:35:32,358
usually I'll Tweet about it or something.

00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:34,030
Definitely encourage it that way.

00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,431
Also if you can, get to know the organizers well enough,

00:35:36,431 --> 00:35:38,892
you can actually ask them for feedback afterwards.

00:35:38,892 --> 00:35:40,009
'Cause they know how it went, right?

00:35:40,009 --> 00:35:42,714
They have a good sense of how much the WiFi was being used,

00:35:42,714 --> 00:35:44,417
people were bored during your talk,

00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:46,920
or how much they saw engagement in other ways afterwards.

00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,368
So, ask the organizers as well if you can.

00:35:49,368 --> 00:35:50,201
- [Guy In Audience] Great.

00:35:50,201 --> 00:35:51,152
And we can certainly share the mic

00:35:51,152 --> 00:35:53,123
if we have some questions inside the room as well,

00:35:53,123 --> 00:35:54,127
just feel free to raise your hand,

00:35:54,127 --> 00:35:56,377
and we'll get the mic over.

00:35:59,939 --> 00:36:02,549
- I was wondering if preparing for a talk like this

00:36:02,549 --> 00:36:04,804
where there's only a few of us in the room,

00:36:04,804 --> 00:36:06,716
and you don't really know what your audience looks like,

00:36:06,716 --> 00:36:09,169
is different in any ways from what you do

00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:11,785
to do an in-person conference talk where you know

00:36:11,785 --> 00:36:13,858
you're gonna have a large crowd in front of you.

00:36:13,858 --> 00:36:15,871
- Totally, it feels super different.

00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:18,515
And it's funny, when I talk to folks about their fears,

00:36:18,515 --> 00:36:20,499
some folks prefer a more intimate setting,

00:36:20,499 --> 00:36:22,279
it feels lower stakes.

00:36:22,279 --> 00:36:24,787
Some folks, if they can see audience faces though,

00:36:24,787 --> 00:36:26,910
it feels way higher stakes if it's a smaller crowd.

00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,682
So, everybody's different this way.

00:36:29,682 --> 00:36:32,208
Because I've had the privilege of giving a lot of talks

00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:34,969
over the air like we do here, but mostly at work,

00:36:34,969 --> 00:36:36,943
it feels a lot less pressure,

00:36:36,943 --> 00:36:39,438
because I know that there are probably some number,

00:36:39,438 --> 00:36:41,924
some question mark number of people.

00:36:41,924 --> 00:36:43,734
The hardest part for me, and for others I think,

00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:44,935
ends up being eye contact.

00:36:44,935 --> 00:36:46,238
If you've got a large group,

00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:48,822
you can look at different areas or pockets of people.

00:36:48,822 --> 00:36:51,818
Here I am like literally looking at every single one of you,

00:36:51,818 --> 00:36:53,108
and hoping that I'm making eye contact

00:36:53,108 --> 00:36:54,032
with somebody out there,

00:36:54,032 --> 00:36:56,372
and I think that that for me is probably the most difficult.

00:36:56,372 --> 00:36:58,624
In terms of preparation, there's not a huge difference,

00:36:58,624 --> 00:37:01,200
other than setting your own expectations and,

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,973
not getting freaked-out if you're actually making eye,

00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:04,605
or if people are looking like they're falling asleep.

00:37:04,605 --> 00:37:06,286
It's way, way different, yeah.

00:37:06,286 --> 00:37:09,032
Actually, when I was practicing this talk

00:37:09,032 --> 00:37:10,488
in a run-through with my co-workers,

00:37:10,488 --> 00:37:12,102
one of my co-workers fell asleep

00:37:12,102 --> 00:37:15,364
with an early iteration of this talk.

00:37:15,364 --> 00:37:16,477
I'm so thankful that that happened,

00:37:16,477 --> 00:37:17,534
'cause that gave me a lot of data

00:37:17,534 --> 00:37:19,648
and insight into the part that was boring,

00:37:19,648 --> 00:37:22,674
that I was able to hopefully improve on.

00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:23,924
- That's great.

00:37:25,178 --> 00:37:28,199
I think a related question that ties in quite well

00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:30,221
is one that we had in the Etherpad.

00:37:30,221 --> 00:37:31,750
What strategies do you use for targeting

00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,607
your technical talks to the right skill level,

00:37:34,607 --> 00:37:36,123
when you don't have a clear picture

00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:37,303
of what your audience will look like,

00:37:37,303 --> 00:37:38,477
how do you find the sweet spot?

00:37:38,477 --> 00:37:39,931
- Yeah, that's a fantastic question.

00:37:39,931 --> 00:37:41,713
Lea Verou did a bunch of writing on this

00:37:41,713 --> 00:37:43,296
that I learned a lot from.

00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:46,565
So what Lea wrote was, try to aim a little bit higher

00:37:46,565 --> 00:37:47,409
than what you think your audience

00:37:47,409 --> 00:37:50,140
will already have experience in, or an aptitude for.

00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,896
This is because if you quote, unquote dumb it down,

00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,323
which is a harsh way of saying,

00:37:54,323 --> 00:37:55,387
"Talk in more layman's terms,"

00:37:55,387 --> 00:37:58,220
or "Include more 101 level stuff."

00:37:59,418 --> 00:38:01,802
Audiences are more likely to blame themselves

00:38:01,802 --> 00:38:03,876
if they don't understand what you're talking about,

00:38:03,876 --> 00:38:06,542
but they're more likely to blame you

00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:08,271
if it feels too 101 or entry level.

00:38:08,271 --> 00:38:09,566
So, definitely aim a little bit higher

00:38:09,566 --> 00:38:11,784
than you think the audience

00:38:11,784 --> 00:38:13,718
will be able to adapt to in the moment.

00:38:13,718 --> 00:38:14,898
They'll also do plenty of research

00:38:14,898 --> 00:38:17,353
if they're confused about it but inspired by it afterwards,

00:38:17,353 --> 00:38:18,410
so don't worry about covering

00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:22,179
all of the possible ground for your audience members.

00:38:22,179 --> 00:38:23,841
- [Guy In Audience] Great, thank you.

00:38:23,841 --> 00:38:26,341
Any questions inside the room?

00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:30,895
- I love his box has really shook his hand-eye coordination.

00:38:30,895 --> 00:38:34,306
- So, I was wondering about the Etsy

00:38:34,306 --> 00:38:35,923
infinite scrolling thing you mentioned,

00:38:35,923 --> 00:38:38,058
can you talk about that change a little more,

00:38:38,058 --> 00:38:39,472
and what the problem was there?

00:38:39,472 --> 00:38:40,305
- Yeah, that's hilarious.

00:38:40,305 --> 00:38:44,102
I didn't mean to nerd snipe you with that, I'm so sorry.

00:38:44,102 --> 00:38:45,403
- [Questioner] What was broken?

00:38:45,403 --> 00:38:48,026
- We still don't know actually, what specifically it was.

00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:52,348
We have hypotheses as to why our users may

00:38:52,348 --> 00:38:53,739
have had better interactions with the site

00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:57,048
when it wasn't infinite scrolling, we don't really know.

00:38:57,048 --> 00:38:58,527
You can always guess, you can do user testing,

00:38:58,527 --> 00:39:00,427
you can interview some people with qualitative methods,

00:39:00,427 --> 00:39:02,437
but quantitatively.

00:39:02,437 --> 00:39:04,926
We have an in-house A/B testing framework

00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,397
that we used to find this out.

00:39:06,397 --> 00:39:07,641
There's actually a Code as Craft post

00:39:07,641 --> 00:39:09,589
about this whole experiment what we found,

00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:11,969
you should definitely check it out.

00:39:11,969 --> 00:39:13,551
- Thanks. - Yeah, you bet.

00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,028
(Lara laughing)

00:39:15,028 --> 00:39:16,028
- Thank you.

00:39:17,414 --> 00:39:20,030
And Potch in Mountain View writes,

00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,852
"During the day of, what tools do you use

00:39:21,852 --> 00:39:23,214
"to help steady your pace,

00:39:23,214 --> 00:39:25,696
"and keep the right words per minute?"

00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,446
- Totally, so for me,

00:39:28,385 --> 00:39:30,345
when I know I get too excited about something,

00:39:30,345 --> 00:39:31,604
I'm probably speaking too fast.

00:39:31,604 --> 00:39:34,267
So, in my head I have a constant like,

00:39:34,267 --> 00:39:35,907
"How excited or happy are you right now?

00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:37,483
"Take a deep breath," thing happening.

00:39:37,483 --> 00:39:41,058
But also, in my presenter notes, which you can't see,

00:39:41,058 --> 00:39:43,278
I have notes to breathe, and to click,

00:39:43,278 --> 00:39:44,912
I also have notes to pause.

00:39:44,912 --> 00:39:47,930
So for me, I'm able to have little reminders in here

00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:48,885
that tell me what to do,

00:39:48,885 --> 00:39:51,634
and remind me to chill out a little bit.

00:39:51,634 --> 00:39:53,605
I've also found that other presenters like to have

00:39:53,605 --> 00:39:54,711
a water bottle or something else

00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:55,786
that they can use with their hands

00:39:55,786 --> 00:39:58,534
to take a deep breath, take a sip of water,

00:39:58,534 --> 00:39:59,994
or relax themselves that way.

00:39:59,994 --> 00:40:02,726
So having something handy like that is really great.

00:40:02,726 --> 00:40:05,226
- [Guy In Audience] Thank you.

00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:08,302
- [Havi] Okay, question?

00:40:08,302 --> 00:40:11,214
- [Guy In Audience] Yeah, sure, absolutely, thank you.

00:40:11,214 --> 00:40:13,093
- Hello. - Hello.

00:40:13,093 --> 00:40:15,806
- You've talked a lot about the ideal scenario

00:40:15,806 --> 00:40:18,545
where you have a lot of time to prepare for a talk.

00:40:18,545 --> 00:40:21,428
But let's say you're called into a meeting last minute,

00:40:21,428 --> 00:40:23,393
and you're asked to speak on a topic,

00:40:23,393 --> 00:40:26,516
and you know the topic but you haven't fully-prepared,

00:40:26,516 --> 00:40:30,336
and you find yourself just like getting flustered,

00:40:30,336 --> 00:40:31,652
what are some tips for that?

00:40:31,652 --> 00:40:33,298
- Winging it, yeah.

00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:34,430
This really depends on

00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,679
what will make you the most comfortable,

00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:38,411
I think you'll know yourself best.

00:40:38,411 --> 00:40:41,689
For me, it helps me decrease the stress level in the room

00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,789
if I acknowledge the situation.

00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:45,574
It can be really intimidating,

00:40:45,574 --> 00:40:47,725
especially if it's very important people at your company

00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:51,416
that you're saying this in front of.

00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:52,780
Audiences actively root for us,

00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:56,338
audiences don't want us to fail or to fumble,

00:40:56,338 --> 00:40:57,445
even your co-workers I would hope

00:40:57,445 --> 00:40:59,148
don't want you to fail or fumble.

00:40:59,148 --> 00:41:01,926
So by acknowledging like, "Hey, this is last minute.

00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,119
"I'm gonna do my best right now,

00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,586
"and if we have other follow-up questions afterwards,

00:41:04,586 --> 00:41:07,229
"I'm happy to get to them."

00:41:07,229 --> 00:41:08,536
By acknowledging that in the room

00:41:08,536 --> 00:41:09,647
and setting the stage that way,

00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:12,503
people will be a lot more empathetic to your situation.

00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:15,226
It also gives you permission to say,

00:41:15,226 --> 00:41:16,347
"I don't know the answer to that question,

00:41:16,347 --> 00:41:17,574
"I'll look it up after."

00:41:17,574 --> 00:41:19,147
Or like, "I don't know the answer to that question,

00:41:19,147 --> 00:41:22,344
"does someone else in the room know the answer?"

00:41:22,344 --> 00:41:24,055
Or literally just like help to redirect things

00:41:24,055 --> 00:41:25,891
back to what you know you wanted to cover,

00:41:25,891 --> 00:41:27,509
and just say like, "I'll get to that later,

00:41:27,509 --> 00:41:32,422
"I'll respond later," punt it as most you feel comfortable.

00:41:32,422 --> 00:41:34,089
- Thank you. - Yeah.

00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:36,764
Havi!

00:41:37,918 --> 00:41:42,291
- Okay, I've got one plus one from the Etherpad.

00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,383
I wanted to know about giving

00:41:44,383 --> 00:41:48,265
specific and actionable feedback to someone who,

00:41:48,265 --> 00:41:51,126
someone like me, who finds themself rocking back and forth,

00:41:51,126 --> 00:41:52,414
or putting their hands in their pockets,

00:41:52,414 --> 00:41:57,118
I have trouble staying still when I'm presenting.

00:41:57,118 --> 00:41:59,957
And there was a follow-on question from somebody else,

00:41:59,957 --> 00:42:01,954
"What advice or what actionable feedback

00:42:01,954 --> 00:42:04,648
"would you offer to someone who jesters too much

00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:07,341
"as a crutch for managing nervousness?"

00:42:07,341 --> 00:42:09,384
- Yeah, totally!

00:42:09,384 --> 00:42:13,417
I am super-jazzed about all the questions in the ethernet.

00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:14,951
If you don't know how many people are actually watching,

00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:16,308
like the amount of questions and interest

00:42:16,308 --> 00:42:18,891
is like a good reassuring sign.

00:42:20,058 --> 00:42:22,471
The cool think about the Hearts and Stars, and I'll bring,

00:42:22,471 --> 00:42:26,638
the Hearts and Diamonds rather, and Clubs and Spades.

00:42:27,481 --> 00:42:29,268
I love that picture of Beyonce.

00:42:29,268 --> 00:42:30,518
Um, here we go.

00:42:31,604 --> 00:42:34,589
The cool thing about specific and actionable feedback is,

00:42:34,589 --> 00:42:35,880
well there's a couple of things that happen,

00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,798
by asking your crew to be framing it in Diamonds and Spades,

00:42:39,798 --> 00:42:42,407
you're removing the judgment from them.

00:42:42,407 --> 00:42:44,958
They're gonna be focusing all of their brain energy on

00:42:44,958 --> 00:42:46,453
is this specific, is this actionable?

00:42:46,453 --> 00:42:47,774
And it becomes a lot easier for them

00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:50,384
to give harsher criticism, because they'll be spending

00:42:50,384 --> 00:42:52,226
most of their mental energy trying not to soften it,

00:42:52,226 --> 00:42:55,416
but trying to make it helpful to the feedback receiver.

00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:59,811
So, when something is as personal as gesturing too much,

00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:02,042
or moving too much, I find that using

00:43:02,042 --> 00:43:03,863
the Diamonds and the Spades can be more of a reflection

00:43:03,863 --> 00:43:07,696
on what is this doing for the audience member?

00:43:08,844 --> 00:43:10,344
Here's an example:

00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,603
one of the things I observed was

00:43:13,603 --> 00:43:15,949
you shifted your weight a lot between your two feet.

00:43:15,949 --> 00:43:17,444
I found that, for me, that was distracting

00:43:17,444 --> 00:43:18,277
as I was watching you.

00:43:18,277 --> 00:43:20,373
So that is, again, specific and it's actionable,

00:43:20,373 --> 00:43:21,669
specific rather it's like,

00:43:21,669 --> 00:43:24,538
you're observing a thing and it can be recorded on camera,

00:43:24,538 --> 00:43:27,170
it's not just a judgment or a feeling about it.

00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:28,827
The distraction part helps the person understand

00:43:28,827 --> 00:43:30,646
why this is something that you're calling out,

00:43:30,646 --> 00:43:33,054
it's not just 'cause you didn't like it.

00:43:33,054 --> 00:43:33,887
It was literally because it was

00:43:33,887 --> 00:43:36,890
distracting to you as an audience member.

00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,846
So, coming to your second question,

00:43:38,846 --> 00:43:40,150
what would you do about it?

00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,508
First of all, I'm sorry,

00:43:41,508 --> 00:43:43,211
practice is gonna be really helpful.

00:43:43,211 --> 00:43:45,806
Second, watching yourself on camera.

00:43:45,806 --> 00:43:47,764
I know no one who is comfortable

00:43:47,764 --> 00:43:49,159
watching themselves on camera.

00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,067
I cannot tell you another speaker who's like,

00:43:51,067 --> 00:43:54,756
"I love listening to the sound of my own voice."

00:43:54,756 --> 00:43:55,768
But definitely, I would recommend

00:43:55,768 --> 00:43:59,344
as much as humanly possible do a talk the whole way through,

00:43:59,344 --> 00:44:01,199
record it even if it's just by yourself,

00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:02,403
and then watch it afterwards.

00:44:02,403 --> 00:44:04,252
Start to pick up on what you are doing

00:44:04,252 --> 00:44:06,556
that's having this effect, and see if there's ways

00:44:06,556 --> 00:44:09,749
that you can be observant of this in yourself.

00:44:09,749 --> 00:44:13,654
For me, the speaking, the breathing fast thing,

00:44:13,654 --> 00:44:15,655
because I knew that I was doing this when I got excited,

00:44:15,655 --> 00:44:17,685
I was able to start to observe that in my own body,

00:44:17,685 --> 00:44:19,809
in my own brain, and that helped me to start

00:44:19,809 --> 00:44:21,901
to improve it in the future.

00:44:21,901 --> 00:44:24,913
I would definitely recommend if you're a feedback giver,

00:44:24,913 --> 00:44:26,113
who is giving this kind of feedback,

00:44:26,113 --> 00:44:27,224
don't interrupt the person,

00:44:27,224 --> 00:44:30,000
or don't stop them while they're answering to be like,

00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,935
"You're shifting your weight again,

00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:32,770
"or you're moving your hands weird again," don't do that.

00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,632
Let them get to the end, give this feedback,

00:44:34,632 --> 00:44:36,708
and then help them do a run-through again.

00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:38,375
- Thank you. - Yeah.

00:44:39,306 --> 00:44:41,064
- So, you mentioned prepping your audience

00:44:41,064 --> 00:44:42,981
during your slide deck.

00:44:44,087 --> 00:44:47,201
Make sure I get this question correct.

00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:50,908
Do you literally show the outline for your talk on a slide

00:44:50,908 --> 00:44:52,246
as a way of kind of saying,

00:44:52,246 --> 00:44:53,413
"Here's the structure for our talk,

00:44:53,413 --> 00:44:54,550
"and here's what we'll be touching on."

00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:55,570
- Yeah, I totally do.

00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:58,376
In fact, I did that here, I can show you an example.

00:44:58,376 --> 00:45:00,911
Which is sneaky, 'cause it came,

00:45:00,911 --> 00:45:03,288
when I bolt it in here, it came later than it normally does,

00:45:03,288 --> 00:45:04,371
look at that.

00:45:05,298 --> 00:45:07,189
I did a whole bunch of landscape and analysis

00:45:07,189 --> 00:45:09,295
before I got to the agenda slide, which is typical for me.

00:45:09,295 --> 00:45:11,681
I don't wanna just start with a really dry agenda,

00:45:11,681 --> 00:45:12,514
although the eating a donut

00:45:12,514 --> 00:45:13,966
usually gets enough of a good laugh,

00:45:13,966 --> 00:45:16,698
it feels a little bit of an engagement.

00:45:16,698 --> 00:45:18,174
But I usually like to build in something like this,

00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:20,492
even if it's not numbered.

00:45:20,492 --> 00:45:21,325
I think,

00:45:22,948 --> 00:45:27,882
there's another example of an image I have in here.

00:45:27,882 --> 00:45:28,715
There it is!

00:45:28,715 --> 00:45:32,053
Here's another example from my web performance talks.

00:45:32,053 --> 00:45:32,918
I kept it high-level enough

00:45:32,918 --> 00:45:35,731
people didn't have to read too much, people could scan it,

00:45:35,731 --> 00:45:36,677
but still be listening to the words

00:45:36,677 --> 00:45:39,542
that I was saying while I was talking over this slide.

00:45:39,542 --> 00:45:42,237
But yeah, I definitely like to include,

00:45:42,237 --> 00:45:44,223
literally like almost like an agenda

00:45:44,223 --> 00:45:45,056
of what I'm gonna cover.

00:45:45,056 --> 00:45:47,231
Because also, people are tracking in their brain

00:45:47,231 --> 00:45:49,779
how far along you are in the talk.

00:45:49,779 --> 00:45:53,656
Actually, it's often a stress-reliever for the audience.

00:45:53,656 --> 00:45:54,489
- [Guy In Audience] Thank you, do we have

00:45:54,489 --> 00:45:57,740
any questions inside the room?

00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:59,198
Okay, we do have one more online.

00:45:59,198 --> 00:46:00,031
- Great.

00:46:00,941 --> 00:46:05,524
- So, you mentioned sometimes adding options to your deck,

00:46:05,524 --> 00:46:08,145
do you ever put silly, or intentionally bad options

00:46:08,145 --> 00:46:09,717
into your presentation as a way

00:46:09,717 --> 00:46:11,906
of steering people towards one answer?

00:46:11,906 --> 00:46:14,034
- Absolutely I do!

00:46:14,034 --> 00:46:16,190
I do it usually like in really overt ways,

00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,594
I try not to be too sneaky about it.

00:46:17,594 --> 00:46:19,494
I'm like, "Look at this terrible option."

00:46:19,494 --> 00:46:21,262
Like for instance, when we were talking back in the days

00:46:21,262 --> 00:46:23,825
before responsive web design was really a thing,

00:46:23,825 --> 00:46:27,116
people were including it as an option, or an m.dot site,

00:46:27,116 --> 00:46:30,325
or just do nothing to optimize your site for mobile users.

00:46:30,325 --> 00:46:32,103
And like, providing this either sillier,

00:46:32,103 --> 00:46:33,900
or like less obvious options,

00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,133
can be really helpful to make your point

00:46:35,133 --> 00:46:37,109
that responsive web design is like a really smart thing.

00:46:37,109 --> 00:46:39,370
So yeah, totally, provide terrible options,

00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:40,706
it'll really help your point land.

00:46:40,706 --> 00:46:42,578
- [Guy In Audience] Great, thank you, any other questions?

00:46:42,578 --> 00:46:43,699
- Yeah I've got,

00:46:43,699 --> 00:46:46,610
I've got one more sort of coming in off the Etherpad,

00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:50,046
it has to do with techniques for staying true

00:46:50,046 --> 00:46:53,016
to your timeframe and your content.

00:46:53,016 --> 00:46:55,933
- [Lara] Yeah, what's the question?

00:46:56,775 --> 00:46:58,710
Sorry, I paraphrased, my bad.

00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:00,432
"What are the techniques that can be used

00:47:00,432 --> 00:47:04,349
"to stay true to your timeframe and content?"

00:47:04,349 --> 00:47:06,445
This comes from Tunisia, this question.

00:47:06,445 --> 00:47:07,278
- Yeah, what do you think stay true to

00:47:07,278 --> 00:47:08,884
means in this context?

00:47:08,884 --> 00:47:12,050
In other words, like stay on topic?

00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,776
- [Havi] I'm gonna do a little bit

00:47:13,776 --> 00:47:16,227
of guessing. - We can guess, yeah.

00:47:16,227 --> 00:47:19,951
- I think being aware of the time you have and filling it,

00:47:19,951 --> 00:47:22,406
I've seen that as a question that repeats often.

00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:25,562
So that part, but then also not being,

00:47:25,562 --> 00:47:26,886
not going off on tangents.

00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:28,010
- Totally.

00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:30,638
Practice, practice, practice, practice,

00:47:30,638 --> 00:47:31,524
practice is really helpful.

00:47:31,524 --> 00:47:34,693
But also I will say, I get to a point in practice

00:47:34,693 --> 00:47:37,649
where I know how much time my talk is gonna take,

00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:40,373
so I'm able to either pad it with extra things

00:47:40,373 --> 00:47:43,484
if I find that I'm speaking too fast, and going under time.

00:47:43,484 --> 00:47:47,164
Or I'm able to shorten it up if say,

00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:48,902
the speaker before me runs overtime,

00:47:48,902 --> 00:47:50,829
I need to shorten mine up anyway.

00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:53,662
So, practicing and having a good estimation of like

00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:57,281
how much time you typically take on average

00:47:57,281 --> 00:47:59,162
to cover this topic, that's really helpful

00:47:59,162 --> 00:48:01,552
to have like a little internal clock.

00:48:01,552 --> 00:48:03,895
When it comes to staying on topic,

00:48:03,895 --> 00:48:06,582
the best thing you can do is know in your head

00:48:06,582 --> 00:48:09,249
when you are most likely to get off tangent.

00:48:09,249 --> 00:48:12,613
So for me, if I'm getting too excited about, again, a thing,

00:48:12,613 --> 00:48:14,226
I will often go off tangent.

00:48:14,226 --> 00:48:16,292
The first time I told the mobile icon font story,

00:48:16,292 --> 00:48:18,551
it was not planned, I just got real excited about it,

00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:20,563
I thought it might be relevant and get a good laugh,

00:48:20,563 --> 00:48:22,230
so I used that joke.

00:48:23,391 --> 00:48:25,264
It can go really well, it can go really poorly.

00:48:25,264 --> 00:48:28,100
I think what you have to do is know your content well enough

00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,838
to recognize in yourself, "I'm going off topic,"

00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:33,255
or "I might be going over or under time."

00:48:35,797 --> 00:48:38,161
- Last call for questions.

00:48:38,161 --> 00:48:39,284
If there's no more questions,

00:48:39,284 --> 00:48:42,117
we're gonna shift into donuts, everybody!

00:48:42,117 --> 00:48:43,371
- [Lara] Donuts!

00:48:43,371 --> 00:48:45,387
Yay, thanks everybody, this has been awesome.

00:48:45,387 --> 00:48:47,687
(audience clapping) - Thank you!

00:48:47,687 --> 00:48:52,639
Thank you so much, we really do have donuts in the room.

00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:55,720
I know that's really cruel to the 60-some live stream--

00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,349
- [Lara] I'm so sorry about live streamers, yeah.

00:48:58,349 --> 00:49:00,943
