Mozilla Common Voice: More Common Voices

Mozilla’s initiative to crowdsource a large dataset of human voices for use in speech technology, is going multilingual! Thanks to the tremendous efforts from Mozilla’s communities and our deeply engaged language partners you can now donate your voice in German, French and Welsh, and we are working to launch 40+ more as we speak. But this is just the beginning. We want Common Voice to be a tool for any community to make speech technology available in their own language.

hello everyone welcome to our tech

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,070
briefing today I'm doing the tech

00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,610
edition from burning office with Michael

00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,210
Ratley

00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:20,329
he will be presenting the famous

00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:23,179
projects common voice and he will be

00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:26,449
telling the story about common voice and

00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:29,359
how to contribute in this project so

00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:32,390
please if you have any question just

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:35,080
write it in the ether pad or you can

00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:38,180
write it in our tech speaker Chanel raps

00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,480
channel and I will be delivering the

00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,880
questions to him thank you so much

00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,400
first of all Thank You Noel Thank You

00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,280
javi Thank You Tech speakers for showing

00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,950
up it's an honor to be here and so I'm

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,670
going to be talking to you today

00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:56,870
unfortunately I have a little disclaimer

00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:58,190
we had our engineer who is who was going

00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,079
to present and he has some slides

00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:03,670
unfortunately can't make it today

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,810
because we are very close to a

00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,359
multi-language launch which I'll talk a

00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:10,819
little bit about later so I have the

00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:12,859
slides I'm going to go over them but I

00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:14,210
don't have as much detail as he does and

00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:15,770
so if there are any questions that I

00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,880
can't answer I would be happy to follow

00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,530
up with you afterwards

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,450
but as monel said this is an

00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,310
introduction to the project of common

00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,710
voice there will be two parts to this

00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,049
the first is the story of common voice

00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,700
itself kind of like the why we exist and

00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:31,520
then I'm going to go over some of the

00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:34,429
architectural stuff the code type stuff

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,799
for you code code monkeys who want to

00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:39,469
talk about how to how to contribute to

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,060
the code side of the project okay

00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:43,939
without further ado let's talk about the

00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,279
story of common voice but first a little

00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:48,319
bit about me so my name is Michael Henry

00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:50,749
I'm a strategist for the open innovation

00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,999
team I was hired by Mozilla about five

00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:55,069
years ago as a front-end engineer

00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:56,499
working on Firefox OS which I'll

00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:59,420
actually talk a little bit about as well

00:01:56,499 --> 00:02:02,990
but these days I'm working on common

00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:05,209
voice and so you probably have heard

00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,369
about what common voice is and you also

00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:10,250
probably know what this device is this

00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:11,040
is Amazon Alexa smart speaker you bring

00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:14,440
into your house

00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,750
but right now the internet or the web

00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,159
the World Wide Web and these smart

00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,709
devices these speech recognition

00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,510
services they don't play together so

00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:23,110
well and that's what I want to talk

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,489
about

00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:29,709
but first let's let's take a step back

00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:31,840
so you might recognize this a few years

00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:34,299
ago Mozilla was working on a mobile

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,360
phone operating system based on the web

00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:39,730
it was called Firefox OS as part of this

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,190
effort we were building a voice

00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:44,739
assistant very similar to Apple's Siri

00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,930
so we wanted our users to be able to

00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:49,810
voice commands to do common tasks like

00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:52,480
search the web text their friends and

00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,280
email stuff like this however it was

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,620
really hard for us to build a voice

00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,430
assistant of the same quality that

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:03,780
people expected from Siri or okay Google

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:06,879
and there's a reason why you see

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,670
computers like our phones and our

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,450
speakers and our desktops and laptops

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:15,549
they learn to understand human speech

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:18,010
very similarly to how humans learn to

00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:21,160
understand human speech they have to

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,109
listen to and process a lot of talking

00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,579
before it can understand the meaning

00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:26,019
behind this words right before I can

00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,299
understand what the words are and

00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:30,940
actually in the case of computers or in

00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:33,250
the case of voice Computers learn slower

00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,859
than humans do so you need a lot of this

00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:39,010
example what's called voice data to

00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:41,379
teach a computer to understand humans to

00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:44,500
give you a sense of scale or how much

00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:47,590
data we need how much voice we need we

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:51,400
need 10,000 hours and what that equates

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:55,269
to is about 10 times all of all the TED

00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,129
Talks ever given ever given in the world

00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:58,870
I'm sorry not ten times hundred times

00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:00,040
all the TED Talks everything in the

00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,500
world so if you never listened to a TED

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,060
talk and collected every single one of

00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,620
them that's on the internet you need to

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,540
do that a hundred times before you can

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,489
even have a single language in a single

00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,190
accent speech recognition technology

00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:15,190
right so this is a big amount of data

00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:18,789
and it's really hard to find this data

00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:20,380
and so we encountered this problem as we

00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:22,599
were building this voice assistant for

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,199
Firefox OS and that voices system was

00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:26,630
called Bonnie

00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:29,120
and we were first looking for English

00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,680
and you were looking all over and it

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,570
turns out that there are a few data sets

00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:37,100
out there but most of them are really

00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:39,050
small or really expensive or both and if

00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:42,440
we're looking for data sets other than

00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:45,320
English in accents other than North

00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,430
American male women you're you're almost

00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:52,310
out of luck entirely and meanwhile

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,900
Firefox OS itself we had a vision as you

00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,270
might know to bring the next billion

00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,430
online right we wanted to put the web in

00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,960
the hands of people who hadn't

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,099
experienced the web before I'm gonna put

00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,590
it right in right in their hands and

00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:06,500
what this meant was really inexpensive

00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:09,289
phones so think around 20 euros which we

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,840
actually did hit and then localized

00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:16,699
content in emerging markets like India

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:19,220
Africa Bangladesh right and but but

00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:21,349
unfortunately there just are no voice

00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,389
data sets of the size and collection

00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:25,039
that we needed in these markets they

00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:28,669
don't exist at all

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,949
it's hard enough in English right so

00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:32,510
that's why Mozilla started the common

00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:34,130
voice project it actually wasn't always

00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,710
called Tom invoice it was called voice

00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:40,690
bank back when we originally started but

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:43,849
last July we rebranded as commonplace

00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:47,030
common voice is Mozilla's initiative to

00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:49,880
crowdsource a large public data set of

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:53,300
human voices to be used in speech

00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,759
technology so that every accent every

00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,430
language every gender can have equal

00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,759
access to this technology it's pretty

00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:04,520
simple how the project it works we built

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,710
a website where you can go and record

00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,509
your voice by reading sentences you can

00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,280
also listen to the sentences that other

00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:11,900
people have recorded and verify if what

00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,470
they said is accurate this is an

00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,970
important part of the overall quality of

00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,979
the data set because we needed to be

00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,479
super accurate to make sure that our

00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:23,090
speech recognition engine is super

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,190
accurate right and then at the end of

00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:28,099
the day we make all of this data

00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:30,080
available on our download page license

00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:32,570
with CC zero so that's a pure public

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,400
domain you can use it for anything you

00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,590
want whether whenever you want whatever

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,770
you want to do with

00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:42,720
and right now well so far we've

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,210
collected about eight to nine hundred

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,160
hours I think it's like 850 hours of

00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:53,100
English data and most of this comes from

00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,200
from us or not most of it I should say

00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,000
about 20% actually comes from us but

00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,130
that's the biggest contributor but then

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,890
the next biggest is India followed by

00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:03,330
Germany in Thailand and then all the way

00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:05,850
down to a hundred different countries

00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:08,040
have donated to this data set in English

00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:11,400
right so the English data set is a

00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,810
pretty diverse in terms of accents but

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,180
English is just the beginning as I

00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:18,240
mentioned earlier we wanted to empower

00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,550
whole new communities to have speech

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,790
technology and so a lot of our efforts

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,740
recently and indeed right now are around

00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:28,890
collecting voice data in multiple

00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,660
languages and something that you are

00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:33,030
actually hearing first because we

00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,490
haven't officially announced this yet we

00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:40,050
are going to be collecting voice data in

00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:41,850
German French and Welsh these are three

00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:45,330
new launched languages that are going to

00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:48,570
be happening very soon in fact in days

00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:52,770
maybe a single day so that's our next

00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:54,810
effort but you might ask yourself well

00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:57,570
you know if mozilla is no longer

00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:59,100
building this amazing web-based

00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,720
smartphone then why are you still

00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,340
collecting this data like you're not you

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,470
don't need a voice assistant anymore

00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,570
well that's a good question I'd like to

00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:09,030
talk about that now

00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:11,790
first and foremost mozilla is still

00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:14,690
building the world's most advanced

00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:17,580
open-source speech recognition engine

00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:20,700
it's called deep speech it's on github

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,230
has about like six and a half thousand

00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,850
stars there are a ton of people who are

00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:26,640
contributing to this and falling along

00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:29,220
with this last November this project

00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:32,130
passed a milestone where it was able to

00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,750
understand English read human speech

00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:37,979
better than humans can

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:40,050
so a human can understand about 96% of

00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,820
the words that we hear right we have a

00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:45,300
sometimes we hear things wrong it's

00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,490
about 4% or about 4% of the time while

00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,480
our engine is actually better than that

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,519
as a

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,230
smaller error rate than humans last

00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:54,720
November and we are continually

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,970
improving this however as I said that

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,699
this is only in English so far that's

00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,709
mostly with North American accents so we

00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:04,529
need to continually build our data set

00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:08,430
to make this a more inclusive engine but

00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:11,070
we've we've only just begun but in

00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,660
addition to the deep speech project

00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,389
which is a really important consumer of

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:18,029
our data there are problems in the voice

00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:19,949
ecosystem that we want to address and at

00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:24,180
the forefront of this voice ecosystem

00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:26,250
they are the rise of these smart voice

00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,500
assistants and smart speakers that we

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,440
put in our house right you probably seen

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:35,190
some of these products if you peel back

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,529
the covers of this market it's actually

00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:40,589
not much of a market at all because this

00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:42,750
industry is dominated by a handful of

00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:45,089
only very small players and nobody else

00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,760
and there's a reason why there's only a

00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:49,860
very small amount of companies that are

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,170
very rich companies that are taking part

00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,600
and that's because building really

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:57,389
accurate speech recognition is extremely

00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,920
hard we already talked about the the

00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:00,420
data piece right that's the that's the

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,550
part that common voice is trying to

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,779
address but even if you're able to do

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,850
the data piece

00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:08,250
you still need a team of machine

00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,920
learning scientists which are very hard

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,130
to hire and very expensive you need

00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,690
highly specialized computing power

00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:17,399
that's also very expensive and you need

00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,540
to run that continually so you need to

00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,029
have some sort of access to

00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,769
infrastructure and then also something

00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:25,410
that's talked about much less is that

00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:27,720
voice recognition is a patent minefield

00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,420
there's just so many different ways that

00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,940
companies have made proprietary just

00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:35,100
processes for instance you can't even do

00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,199
a client-server architecture for speech

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,699
recognition without paying this company

00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:39,930
called nuance which is up here you may

00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:41,699
not have heard of them but they're a

00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,410
very big player in this space you have

00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:47,430
to pay them money just to even make a

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:50,459
server fur for speech service so this is

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:52,230
a really significant economic hurdle and

00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:53,699
in addition to all this if you're

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,579
somehow able to do all the things I just

00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:58,470
mentioned that you still have to build a

00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:00,149
product or service that can compete with

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,450
these existing players in the market

00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:03,100
right and so

00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,680
this has created a winner-take-all

00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,050
scenario that is stifling innovation and

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,410
it's preventing all of us from taking

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:12,310
part and I don't just mean people

00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,970
consumers from around the world I mean

00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:18,150
voice service providers and I'm thinking

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:21,310
hobbyists startups universities

00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:23,290
researchers anybody besides one of these

00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:26,410
players it's really hard for them to get

00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:28,840
involved and so we want to disrupt this

00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:31,090
and empower empower a whole new people

00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,100
to be able to build boy services by

00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,380
making it cheap and easy so that's

00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:39,370
another reason for common boys to exist

00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:41,770
as well as deep speech and and if we

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,750
talk more generally about voice and why

00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:46,840
we care so much about voice it's that

00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:48,850
voice technology has an incredible

00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,580
potential to do good in the world

00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:54,580
it's not just about convenience it's not

00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:56,170
just about being able to do something on

00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,240
the go or do something without your

00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,380
hands but think about people who are

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,360
sight-impaired

00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,790
voice voice technology like screen

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,590
readers have always been a big deal and

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,570
their lives in if voice technology could

00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,550
empower people who are saying paired to

00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,950
interact with more pieces of technology

00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,170
this would be a really beneficial

00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,240
technology for them not just sight

00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,770
impaired that also may be physically

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,010
impaired so if people can't use a

00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:22,450
keyboard or a mouse or a screen but then

00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:24,730
there's also a large parts of the world

00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,620
that are illiterate and who have no

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:29,230
access to the Internet no access to this

00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:32,170
information but if we had a voice

00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:34,480
assistant we could bridge the gap and

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:36,790
perhaps give them provide services that

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,980
can help people take part in this techno

00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,660
technological revolution right that the

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,520
dream of bringing the next billion

00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,230
people to the internet or bringing the

00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,120
next the Internet to the next billion

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,560
people is still alive with voice and

00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,710
then of course children and the elderly

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,750
this is another big story that we think

00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:57,250
voice can can help and help unlock the

00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:59,980
potential for so that's it that's what

00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:02,680
Mozilla is doing in the voice space we

00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,750
want to disrupt this this kind of closed

00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,880
ecosystem and empower whole new

00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,130
generations of people to be able to take

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,350
part in this technology and also take

00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:14,350
part in the Internet as I said common

00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:15,040
voice is just the data piece itself

00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,839
which we think

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,660
interesting but then we also have

00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:21,100
project deep speech which is

00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:24,310
intrinsically linked to project common

00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,920
voice and these two pieces together we

00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:28,839
hope will make speech technology cheap

00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,630
and easy for any type of person who

00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:33,190
wanted to build a voice service or

00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:37,420
consumers who wanted their voice to be

00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:39,069
heard and understood so that's it as I

00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,310
said this is this is me again you can

00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:44,259
get in touch with me on Twitter or

00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:46,779
here's my email address I think maybe

00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:49,779
before we move into the architecture

00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:51,490
piece of this talk which is again not my

00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:53,350
slides but I would love to pause here

00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:57,399
and see if there are any questions are

00:13:53,350 --> 00:14:01,300
we able to do that I do have like two

00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:04,089
questions maybe maybe we can do that

00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:07,199
first yeah you said that we need to pay

00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:11,620
the US company for setting up a speech

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:14,680
server so someone from the Tech speakers

00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,480
is asking why we need if you can share

00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,449
more details about that why we need to

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,250
pay them yeah so in America anyway so

00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:22,779
this is not worldwide patent but there's

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:25,480
a patent in America that this company

00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:28,209
nuance holds for the architecture of

00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,579
having a client device record your voice

00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:33,089
send the recording to a server the

00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:35,319
server does the speech-to-text

00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:37,089
translation and then sends that

00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:40,329
translation back to the device right

00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:42,760
this is a pretty common paradigm for

00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:45,670
doing like any sort of web web-based

00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,339
interaction right well nuance 20 years

00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,740
ago or so saw this is a very powerful

00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:52,720
paradigm for voice and they patented

00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:54,670
that process believe it or not and that

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,600
patent went through so in America all of

00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:59,350
the big companies you see like Siri

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,410
Alexa

00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:05,230
okay Google they use this sort of

00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,970
architecture because no no waste

00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,709
recognition is done offline right now

00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:11,230
it's all in the cloud and so they have

00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:14,139
to pay royalties to nuance just to even

00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:16,449
put up this service and so if you are a

00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:18,850
university trying to do a free and

00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:20,769
open-source version of voice recognition

00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,910
service well guess what it's not free

00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:24,600
because you're gonna have to pay a

00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:26,940
nuance just to even have it in America

00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,950
so this is this is some

00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,200
that but so the way we are addressing

00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:32,940
this is we hope that deep speech itself

00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,980
this is the voice recognition software

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:37,140
of the building can be done in the

00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,210
offline local manner so we are building

00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:42,210
deep speech so that it can be installed

00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:44,970
upon a Raspberry Pi or an Android phone

00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,650
and will allow you to not have to set up

00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:49,020
a server but can do everything on the

00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:51,420
device and this is not just great for

00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:53,310
avoiding that patent this is also much

00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,920
faster because there's no over the wire

00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:58,380
communication it's all done right there

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,030
as well as it's more private because the

00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,610
data doesn't go anywhere into the cloud

00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:04,830
it's all local on your device so you

00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,900
kind of get control over this data so

00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:09,210
there's many there's kind of many facets

00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,980
to why our deep speech is taking this

00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:14,880
kind of offline approach and the patent

00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:19,290
is just one of those angles perfect

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:23,720
thank you I do have another question but

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:26,970
it's a little bit technical I think so

00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,490
we have Kalyan is saying if it's moved

00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:32,550
to other tip if the common voice is

00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:37,410
moved to other languages how the speech

00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:39,660
engine tackles the dialects for each

00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:43,650
language yes that's a very good question

00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:45,060
dialects accents different ways of

00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:48,870
speaking as well as different ways of

00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:51,870
writing there are many kind of variables

00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:54,390
when it comes to collecting voice data

00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,700
and writing as you are as you are

00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:58,470
mentioning or as you're calling out it's

00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:03,180
much more useful for speech recognition

00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:04,530
engine to be aware of these details for

00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,470
a number of reasons but one of the

00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:08,610
biggest reasons is that you could

00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:11,069
specialize your speech recognition

00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:14,550
engine to for instance recognize

00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:17,100
Scottish English or maybe Hoth voyage

00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:20,760
which is like the northern spoken of

00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:23,339
German and so the way that common voice

00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,780
is addressing this is through identity

00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:26,970
on our website and this is something

00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,260
that we're just starting to explore so

00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,570
if you go to the common voice website

00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:33,210
now you'll see that we have a profile

00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:35,640
and in that profile we ask people to

00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:38,790
identify what kind of accent they speak

00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,860
with the current language English being

00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,390
that the only launched language

00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,460
now but as I said that's changing very

00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:46,230
soon this accent list that we have right

00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,660
now it's not very it's not very

00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:51,480
comprehensive and so what we have been

00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,360
doing is working with members of the

00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,679
standards body called ISO and they are

00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,070
we're using some of their

00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,410
recommendations on how we can classify

00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:05,580
different regional dialects and

00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:08,130
different accents too to allow our users

00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,350
to self-report kind of the way that they

00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,630
speak is this is not an easy thing this

00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:15,390
is not a science in fact the ISO body

00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,590
who were working with has recently kind

00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,299
of gone back to the drawing board

00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:23,100
started over with their with their

00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:25,380
standards work among accents so really

00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:28,280
this is going to be an ongoing challenge

00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:30,630
for us to to kind of track correctly

00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,299
thankfully though the common witch

00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:35,190
project has a group of speech and

00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:38,100
linguistic experts who are advising us

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:41,070
we call them the speech advisory group

00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:43,620
and these consists of people in academia

00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:45,750
for both big and small languages like

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,360
under-resourced languages like Welsh for

00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:51,870
instance Bangor University in Wales

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:54,570
languages like Hebrew Arabic French that

00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:57,150
is really all all over the world both

00:18:54,570 --> 00:19:00,120
academic and commercial and what we try

00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:02,549
to do is addresses from a use case we

00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:05,400
try to say okay if you are a consumer of

00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:07,590
this data what sorts of metadata points

00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,650
would be useful for you and we start to

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:12,720
we're starting to collect a way to

00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:14,640
collect that emitted metadata and so

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,380
there are lots of there's a lot of work

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,640
to be done here and we have not done it

00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,160
perfectly yet and it's going to be an

00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,980
ongoing challenge but I'm pretty

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,870
confident over the next year as we sort

00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,299
of learn about this data set collection

00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,290
that we can get to a really nice place

00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:29,910
one of the ideas were kicking around

00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:32,790
right now to get pretty specific with

00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:35,150
you is we think that we if we have users

00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:38,850
identify what is their native language

00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:41,010
what where did they grow up from ages 2

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:43,799
to age 5 and then where did they go to

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:46,770
school we can kind of encapsulate a lot

00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:48,540
of the different pieces of what makes up

00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:51,809
an accent because it's not just region

00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:54,120
actually it's also for lack of a better

00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:54,930
word it's also how posh you speak so

00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,910
someone from London

00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:58,740
two people from London depending on what

00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:02,010
school they went to could speak very

00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:04,410
differently and so there are there are

00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:06,960
ways to find this out it's just not a

00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,190
highly standardized process yet so this

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,630
is something it sorry for the long

00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,670
answer but it is definitely something

00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:14,190
that we spend a lot of time on and it's

00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:16,140
something that we are constantly trying

00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:20,670
to address and we will be improving as

00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:25,280
we move along perfect thank you it's

00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:28,160
actually a very detailed answer I think

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:31,380
it's connected to my next questions

00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,750
which is about contribution so besides

00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,810
contributing to giving giving your voice

00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:38,850
it's like for example i'm an arabic

00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,980
person and i can give my voice in

00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:46,230
english because i have different accent

00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:49,620
as american english so i think i think

00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:52,640
that we need that for command rise and

00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:56,130
also maybe what do you recommend you

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,860
recommend contributor to to give their

00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,840
native language more than like english

00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,970
in different accents so this is the

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:07,340
first question the second question

00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:11,490
besides giving the way like providing

00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:13,470
your your voice is there any technical

00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:16,650
way to contribute in common source

00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:19,650
project like i know maybe it's related

00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:21,740
to the to your next presentation but

00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:25,350
just if you have any collage of

00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:27,120
contribution and people can know how to

00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:30,750
contribute and even like for tech

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:33,480
speakers if they wanna make like a

00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:36,720
public speaking like in a conference or

00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,850
anything about that great yes there are

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,610
definitely multiple ways to contribute

00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:44,520
the first question i like to the first

00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:46,590
question first which is if you have an

00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,540
accent or if you have a native language

00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:50,280
like what's more valuable to us right

00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,440
you speak in your native or should you

00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,330
be speaking in english which might not

00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,860
be your native or whatever language is

00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,360
not your native that you also speak and

00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,710
by the way congratulations if you're

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:03,360
speaking multiple languages this is

00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:04,560
great we actually want one both and it's

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,840
really important that we get both

00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,850
because the current voice recognition

00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,700
technology is really

00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:13,950
kind of biased towards native speakers

00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,470
of as I said North American male

00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:18,990
speakers right so Siri works really

00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:21,000
great for me it might not work for most

00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:23,310
people in the world right a vast

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,780
majority like 80% of the world it's not

00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:26,790
so good for and that's one of the things

00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:29,850
we're trying to address is that we want

00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:32,640
accents to be recognized and so yes

00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:34,230
definitely if you don't speak a language

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,390
natively but you know how to speak a

00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,970
language we want your voice and in fact

00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:41,070
you will be contributing to making voice

00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:43,050
technology better for people who speak

00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:45,120
with your accent by contributing your

00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:47,040
voice said please do but also if you

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,030
speak natively one of these languages so

00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,340
for instance we're launching a new

00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:52,620
German soon and if you speak German we

00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,450
would love that as well because in a lot

00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,250
of languages besides English they don't

00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,890
even have German data or they don't even

00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:01,980
have native data sets and there's some

00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:04,920
big big holes in this data set space for

00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:07,560
instance Hindi is a hugely spoken

00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,030
language I guess it's not there are many

00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,210
people who don't speak it natively but

00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:15,750
also speak it we we could not find any

00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:18,060
Hindi data set at all so if we could

00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:22,020
create the Hindi data set we can empower

00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:24,810
whole new types of communication through

00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:26,370
the speech technology and so yes we want

00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:28,650
native we want not native pretty much

00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:31,200
any language that you can read out loud

00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:34,770
that you have that ability please do it

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,780
so so that's so that's to answer that

00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:38,400
question in terms of how to contribute

00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,320
there are multiple ways and as you

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,120
noticed it's it's there as you're

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,980
looking to it's not just donating your

00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,590
voice and listen to others there's

00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,780
another side of common voice which is

00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:50,880
you need to be able to read sentences

00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,890
and so part of our effort for launching

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,900
a new languages is collecting sentences

00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,940
in these new languages for people to

00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,290
read and because the data that we are

00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,780
publishing at the end of the day is

00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:02,580
public domain cc0 these sentences have

00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,900
to come from the public domain and so

00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,750
it's pretty hard to find these sentences

00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,040
because most most material that you find

00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:11,010
that's written is copyrighted

00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:14,360
for instance news sites podcast

00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:17,130
transcripts movies books usually

00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,780
copyrighted and so what we've been

00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:20,060
trying to do is crowdsource the

00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:23,720
collection of the

00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:25,730
as well and most recently how we did

00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,830
this is Mozilla has this thing called

00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,780
the global sprint and it's a two-day

00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,880
hack people all over the world get

00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,800
together and try to contribute to open

00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,590
source projects and so we we

00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,490
participated in this and we had

00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:39,530
contributors from all over the world

00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:41,390
tried to collect sentences in the native

00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:43,070
languages for people to read on common

00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,870
voicing part of that was then writing

00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:47,210
their own sentences or taking their blog

00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:49,910
post or maybe text messages but then

00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:51,410
there are also kind of scraping the

00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:52,970
internet trying to find places where

00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,530
there were public domain materials and

00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:56,420
collecting them and over this two-day

00:24:54,530 --> 00:25:00,590
period we were able to collect about

00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:03,950
30,000 sentences in 30 languages which

00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:06,530
is a good start but I think we will need

00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:08,560
to do more of this sentence collection

00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:11,690
so this will be a way to participate

00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,760
right now our process is pretty kind of

00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:16,160
messy de facto it's not on the website

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,280
itself it's on a whole another website

00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,750
and tool but we want to get a nice story

00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,100
around that and so if that's something

00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,960
you're interested in kind of spreading

00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,810
the word about like talk to me about

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,550
that we'll find ways to will find entry

00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:30,050
points for you to talk about and how we

00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:31,850
can get it to get involved in that so

00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,590
that's another piece sentence collection

00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:36,050
and then the third piece which I think

00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:38,630
you mentioned was technical so the

00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:40,880
website itself is what I'm about to talk

00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:44,780
about in a minute here but it's an open

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:49,550
source project on github and it is it's

00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:51,830
a react app with a node.js back-end my

00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:53,990
sequel database using s3 will talk about

00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:55,670
all of that but absolutely we want

00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:58,340
people to come and contribute to this

00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,720
and we have some Help Wanted bugs and so

00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:02,000
far actually it's been a really

00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,170
successful project in terms of in terms

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,180
of getting contributors we have a

00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:06,740
hundred and seventy people who have

00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,810
already contribute to that project so

00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:11,150
that's it's it's been pretty successful

00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:12,980
in the community and if you're a web

00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,260
developer there's a great strolling

00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,290
around contributing to them which I can

00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:20,630
talk about in just a minute

00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:23,240
yeah are there any other questions just

00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:29,270
one question was the name of the

00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:33,650
repository exactly on github its

00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:38,840
github.com slash Mozilla slash voice

00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:41,870
- web okay yeah that's the one perfect

00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:45,650
you can put a link somewhere yeah I'm

00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:49,970
gonna put the link in now in the ether

00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:52,520
pad and yeah and you you can we I don't

00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:55,010
have more questions so you can move on

00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:58,880
to do okay let's see I have to just

00:26:55,010 --> 00:27:01,040
switch my slides here yeah let's see if

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:07,880
I can do this without crashing my

00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:10,880
computer all right okay

00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:13,340
so sorry for the disclaimer but these

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,850
are not my slides I do know about the

00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:18,440
technological side but I'm not the

00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:20,270
primary developer here and a primary

00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,240
developer as I said he's kind of heads

00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:24,740
down finishing out the last pieces of

00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,720
our launch and so unfortunately I just

00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,040
couldn't make it today I'm gonna try to

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,260
go over this as I said if there are

00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,570
questions I'm happy to follow up with

00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:35,510
you afterwards and happy to connect you

00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:37,400
to Gregor who's an excellent developer

00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:40,010
and also an excellent person in general

00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:43,070
if he's really great to talk to so I'm

00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:44,510
sad he can't make it but we'll move on

00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:47,210
nonetheless show must go on

00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:51,020
so this is the architecture of common

00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:52,940
voice which is a responsive web map we

00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,630
have the website that you seen a little

00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:59,060
bit already

00:27:53,630 --> 00:28:01,670
it works in Chrome Firefox it does not

00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:04,460
work in Safari it works in mobile Chrome

00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:06,980
on mobile Firefox and then for iOS we

00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:10,070
have a native app but our native app is

00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:12,980
really just a wrapper of the of the

00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:14,960
webpage itself and then it it kind of

00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:18,500
polyfills some of the api's that we need

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,050
specifically how he access how we do

00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,580
transcoding of audio data but i'm not

00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:25,460
gonna get into that level of detail for

00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:29,060
now we just have an iOS app a responsive

00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:32,210
web app okay great so what we're gonna

00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:34,610
talk about today will give you a kind of

00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:37,280
intro of what the code looks like some

00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:38,750
high-level questions and then where we

00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,960
will over kind of some of the

00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:44,270
architectural type stuff and we'll be

00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,509
happy to answer any questions that you

00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:52,269
might have about about that and about

00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:53,949
trevean okay and part of the part of

00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:56,529
what Gregor was going to talk about

00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:58,719
today was what he did when he came in

00:28:56,529 --> 00:29:01,179
and took over this project because

00:28:58,719 --> 00:29:03,789
originally I built this a very quick

00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:06,129
prototype and then when we realize that

00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:08,999
people actually wanted this we we

00:29:06,129 --> 00:29:11,559
brought Gregor on to really come in and

00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:13,239
industrialize that website and so you

00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:15,339
know he did some really cool stuff like

00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:16,809
he moved to the latest technologies we

00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:19,869
were using gulp before now we're using

00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:22,629
webpack I was using pre-act because I

00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:25,299
love the lightweightness he loves react

00:29:22,629 --> 00:29:28,199
17 and all the fancy new features of

00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:31,299
that so he migrated to that he also

00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:35,169
started to use Redux to kind of handle

00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:37,599
some of our local caching of data and

00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:39,369
then you know server-side sinking and

00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:42,249
then towards the end of this I'm going

00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:44,289
to talk about our dependency tree and

00:29:42,249 --> 00:29:46,389
like what kind of modules we have and

00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:51,940
then some of the kind of future

00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:54,789
direction of the site yeah so if you

00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:57,879
don't know about why what gulp and web

00:29:54,789 --> 00:30:01,690
Packer these are build tools gulp is

00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:04,119
kind of a imperative meaning like a it's

00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:05,679
it's almost like a programming it's

00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:09,339
almost like running a script like you

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:11,139
tell it what to do step by step and you

00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:12,279
have some tools for doing for doing this

00:30:11,139 --> 00:30:15,609
stuff you have some great like a

00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:17,949
streaming API for or trends transforming

00:30:15,609 --> 00:30:19,029
data but it's pretty simple to

00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:22,029
understand because you're basically

00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:25,719
running a node file what that is a

00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:28,089
little bit like a bundle of magic you

00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:32,429
kind of declare upfront you say hey web

00:30:28,089 --> 00:30:34,629
pack I want my site to work like this

00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:38,379
and then you talk about like how does

00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:40,119
the dependencies and also how you

00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:41,679
basically set up upfront you can figure

00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:43,389
it and then it figures out how to do

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,279
everything for you which there's tons of

00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:46,299
functionality built into that for

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,519
instance you could do server-side

00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:51,129
rendering if you wanted to

00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:52,899
there's tons of like magic transcoding

00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:54,489
like babel and the pipeline there's tons

00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:55,989
of stuff you can put in the pipeline so

00:30:54,489 --> 00:30:57,999
we wanted to move to this because this

00:30:55,989 --> 00:30:59,950
is quickly becoming kind of the paradigm

00:30:57,999 --> 00:31:03,940
for build systems in the web

00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:05,559
like it or not I tend to love the

00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:08,740
imperative style but it's also kind of

00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:11,020
can become messy and so webpack kind of

00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,549
hides all of that complexity for you and

00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:15,630
so you get some nice kind of

00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:18,610
out-of-the-box features if you embrace

00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:23,140
it embrace the ecosystem which we are

00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:26,140
doing now and then react to react so the

00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:27,910
reason so if you haven't heard react

00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:29,559
before so I'll just say what that is

00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:32,559
that's a front-end

00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:35,650
it's a front-end framework for when

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:37,270
rendering your your web app and then

00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:40,390
pre-act is actually a version of the

00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:42,040
react which is much much smaller and one

00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:43,840
of the reasons I stayed away from react

00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:46,510
for so long is because I used to work at

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,419
Firefox OS and if you were to try to

00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:51,910
bundle for instance a hundred kilobytes

00:31:49,419 --> 00:31:54,309
of JavaScript just to even get started

00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:56,080
building your app this would already

00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:57,160
cause some of these slower devices that

00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,470
I talked about like a twenty dollar

00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:01,090
smartphone it would probably take ten

00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:05,590
seconds just to parse that much

00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:07,630
JavaScript so my internal like Firefox

00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:10,390
OS developer tends to stay away from

00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:12,970
these these frameworks because of heavy

00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:14,710
heavy load now of course this that's no

00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:16,500
longer quite as true smartphones are

00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:19,450
much more powerful than it used to be

00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,490
react is actually not as heavy as it

00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:23,020
used to be but in any case I started

00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:26,530
with pre-act because of the lower

00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:29,080
footprint but react has a lot more

00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:31,570
features that we wanted to do and

00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,640
especially it just integrates very well

00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:36,419
as I've mentioned earlier embracing the

00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:40,210
ecosystem allowing us to kind of use

00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:43,600
what are the standard tools allowed us

00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:45,370
to to really benefit from from kind of

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,690
embracing this ecosystem forgot to

00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:50,860
mention we are we are also using

00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:53,350
typescript as so it's not just a vanilla

00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:56,910
JavaScript application we use typescript

00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:56,910
both on the front end in the back end

00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:02,770
and then of course we we started to use

00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:05,260
redux we have so in the early days of

00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:07,990
common voice everything what we were

00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:10,630
very much privacy centric so all of your

00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:12,400
profile information was actually stolen

00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,080
just in your browser we didn't store it

00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,390
and data

00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,810
where we wanted to keep we wanted to

00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:20,760
keep it kind of out of our hands and a

00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:23,880
lot of this had to do with us being

00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:26,070
afraid to have personally identifying

00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,920
the information inside a voice data and

00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:30,870
I'll talk a little bit about that later

00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:33,240
so we were just using things like Lola

00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:37,920
storage right and so I think this moving

00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:40,560
to redux allowed us to have a more

00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:43,380
standardized way of keeping our data

00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:45,480
locally but then also we added a

00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:48,480
server-side database as we started to

00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,640
embrace identity on the website and

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,770
we're soon gonna be adding logins and so

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,390
Redux allows us to do a lot of keeping

00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:57,060
things in sync a lot easier and do

00:33:54,390 --> 00:34:00,570
things in a more standardized way as I

00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:01,800
said embracing the ecosystem which you

00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:04,890
know I think all of these changes really

00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:07,320
did improve the usability of our product

00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:08,400
and allow more people to contribute

00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,170
because then we'll use to these

00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:14,730
technologies in the early days I just

00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:15,990
wrote everything from scratch okay so on

00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:18,510
the front end these are kind of the

00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:21,540
components that we have you can just

00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:23,370
kind of get to see what the size of

00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,910
these different pieces are so you know

00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:30,720
it turns out that react react Dom are

00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:32,310
big but not not like huge so hugely big

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,040
that it dominates everything inside of

00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:40,980
our application so it made sense to make

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:43,320
the switch going forward we are planning

00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:46,620
or we are tentatively planning to start

00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:50,670
using CSS in JavaScript and what this

00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:52,500
means is abandoning style sheets are in

00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:54,990
a way at least advantage new style

00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:57,420
sheets so that all of our CSS gets

00:34:54,990 --> 00:35:01,620
injected it gets defined and injected

00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:03,300
straight into our react components this

00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:06,390
is a very controversial thing and I'm

00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:09,990
not here to defend this decision what I

00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:13,620
will say is that this allows us to

00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:16,230
support right-to-left languages way way

00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:18,240
easier and so this is kind of a best

00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:20,310
practice for right-to-left and so

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,640
regardless of what that you like this

00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:26,130
practice or not a lot of you know a lot

00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,740
of me rejects this because I spent

00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:30,630
years of trying to encapsulate CSS and

00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,710
JavaScript separately and have these

00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,390
things apart and now all the sudden

00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,680
they're being mixed back together but

00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,720
there's actually some really great

00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,130
features that this provides and so we're

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,450
going we're probably going to be unique

00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,390
to this we haven't done it yet but

00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:43,950
especially if you want to support

00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:47,010
right-to-left languages we think we're

00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:49,380
going to have to okay so this is the

00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:52,020
basic architecture of our back-end so

00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:54,650
this is the the not the front-end side

00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:57,150
of the backend the backend is a node.js

00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:59,550
application it's also using typescript

00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:04,440
and it also uses a web pack to do the

00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:07,710
building at the very front of the

00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:11,820
backend we have our API layer and our

00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:13,290
API layer has both has like a couple of

00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:15,690
different things that I want to separate

00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:18,270
out for you here we have our way of

00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:20,790
tracking the clips or the audio files

00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:22,770
and then we have our database or our

00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:26,010
model the reason why these are separate

00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:28,200
is because the when we publish this data

00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:29,730
the voice clips itself we don't want to

00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,830
have any personally identifying

00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:33,510
information so no matter what kind of

00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:35,220
user you are no matter what kind of

00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:37,800
identity you have what kind of profile

00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,450
you have on our site which could include

00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,100
things like your email address or your

00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,110
amount of contributions your social

00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,820
connections etc etc we want to keep that

00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:46,560
completely separate from the voice data

00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,780
the voice data is all completely

00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,700
anonymous in a giant bucket so we've

00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,770
built our application to keep these

00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,830
things very separate of course there can

00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:57,090
be communication between the two but

00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:59,130
architectural II speaking they're always

00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:01,320
separate so that we can ensure our users

00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:04,830
privacy so that's what I kind of want to

00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:07,320
call out here this is if we actually

00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:10,290
drill into how this components look it's

00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:13,350
a little bit more complex but the

00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:16,950
overall paradigm that I just showed to

00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:20,730
you is what we we have achieved the rim

00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:24,500
of this encapsulation and this is the

00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:27,120
diagram I have kind of like a user flow

00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:30,090
again this is just to illustrate that

00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:33,180
this is the thing that I had to draw for

00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:35,460
our legal department to ensure that that

00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,320
our voice data is completely separate

00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,420
from our

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,160
our internal database we want to make

00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:43,250
sure that our users privacy is protected

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,350
in that their identity is protected in

00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:48,170
this data and so we go through great

00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:50,690
pains to keep those separate so this

00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:52,670
this data flow is something that we're

00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:57,560
going to have to we have to adhere to

00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:58,790
even as we go forward yeah one of the

00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,970
things you may be interested in so we

00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:04,910
have a isequal database now how we do

00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:06,680
migrations I don't know how familiar all

00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:10,250
of you are with infrastructure we have

00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:12,560
here at Mozilla but we have a operations

00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:14,780
team as a open source project called

00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:17,090
nubes and this handles all of our cloud

00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:19,670
deployments so Nimbus does it allows us

00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:22,340
to have clusters of machines that

00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:24,950
represent a deployment and so the way it

00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:27,050
works is every time we push code to

00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:29,000
master so every time we merge a pull

00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:31,640
request for instance we have a staging

00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,520
machine who is pulling this data in and

00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:37,190
rebuilding a cluster of machines what's

00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:41,000
what's cool about nubes is that it makes

00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:43,700
sure that it will always have uptime so

00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,350
it has its running existing cluster it

00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:48,200
will build a new cluster but keep the

00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:50,420
old cluster around until it's sure that

00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,580
whatever changes you've made build and

00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:54,440
pass all this tests and once it's done

00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,990
and say ok throws out the old cluster

00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:00,590
brings in the new cluster and we also

00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:03,650
have a staging and production version of

00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:05,300
this and so this is great except for

00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:07,520
when we want to do schema migrations

00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:10,340
because we have clusters of like 3 to 10

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,020
machines depending on load and so how do

00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:13,550
we know like which machine is going to

00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:15,260
do the database migration and when I say

00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:17,480
migration I mean like changing the

00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,400
schema the tables adding tables dropping

00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,690
tables and columns stuff like this we

00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,020
need to make sure only one machine does

00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:25,880
this so we have a process for what's

00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,800
called election or leadership election

00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,990
so these machines they communicate with

00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,600
each other and say ok your int and then

00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:36,860
this machine will run will basically

00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:39,620
take itself offline run this this update

00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:41,180
to our database and then once everything

00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,619
is done it just goes back into the

00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,690
cluster so

00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:47,089
kind of like this Skiba migration thing

00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:49,099
is about this is mostly owned by Gregor

00:39:47,089 --> 00:39:51,039
now so if you have any actual questions

00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:54,170
about this I can't tell you a whole lot

00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:58,279
detail but I can certainly put you in

00:39:54,170 --> 00:40:03,499
touch with him um but that's it actually

00:39:58,279 --> 00:40:05,029
so that's kind of the application we

00:40:03,499 --> 00:40:07,099
have as I said the projects on github

00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:09,410
there's a link to it now on etherpad

00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:11,029
we have helped once in funds but a lot

00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:12,259
of to be honest right now a lot of the

00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:14,509
ones that are left for kind of the

00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:16,970
trickier ones we need to start adding

00:40:14,509 --> 00:40:18,589
some new help on the bugs which we will

00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:21,259
be doing soon probably right after watch

00:40:18,589 --> 00:40:24,289
so this week let's see a bunch of more

00:40:21,259 --> 00:40:29,380
help when it bugs coming up and as I

00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:35,749
said just a note react my Siegel and s3

00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:37,849
back-end that's it so Valencia can get

00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:39,769
contributions debug cards they

00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:41,990
absolutely can do the both the front end

00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:44,960
and the back end we have a contributors

00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:47,059
guide on the github page itself that

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,339
kind can get you up and started if

00:40:47,059 --> 00:40:50,869
you're a fan of docker we have a docker

00:40:49,339 --> 00:40:52,970
container you can use but you can also

00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:56,680
just install the technologies yourself

00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:59,059
or create your own virtual machines and

00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:01,249
it should that should have everything

00:40:59,059 --> 00:41:04,279
there to get you started with a mobile

00:41:01,249 --> 00:41:06,559
development if you find any bugs in that

00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:07,609
or if you have problems with that let us

00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:14,630
know because we need to fix the

00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:17,089
documentation how did you have anything

00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:20,660
do you have any question do you see any

00:41:17,089 --> 00:41:25,730
questions someone let me do one more

00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:28,489
check I have not seen new questions

00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:31,309
coming in this is so excellent thank you

00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:33,440
so much Michael you gave your records

00:41:31,309 --> 00:41:36,140
Dec with authority you could have gotten

00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,509
away with not telling runs it was and

00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:41,599
just just so you know the impression

00:41:38,509 --> 00:41:44,329
that that was helpful I was actually

00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:48,140
looking for the specific link from the

00:41:44,329 --> 00:41:50,059
repo to the choose a contributors guide

00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:52,819
and I'm gonna drop that in the etherpad

00:41:50,059 --> 00:41:55,460
but all I think that oh you did that

00:41:52,819 --> 00:41:56,460
already yeah I already have done it oh

00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:02,520
very

00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:05,609
okay last call in the channels if you're

00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:08,849
on telegram and you have a burning

00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:13,020
question for Michael or his Holly

00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:15,720
Gregoire here now you can drop it here

00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:21,630
later and we will route it over to

00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:25,650
Michael and I think that might be it for

00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:27,630
today so good luck with your with your

00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:32,190
rollout which sounds like it's happening

00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:33,869
in real and look forward to whatever's

00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:35,339
next and I hope you'll come back in I

00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:36,990
don't know a couple of quarters or

00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:39,540
something like that and share an update

00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:40,530
I would love to come back thanks so much

00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,030
for having us

00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:44,880
thank you tech speakers for your

00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:46,980
interest please stay keep in touch with

00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,380
us I'd love to speak with you any time

00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:52,940
like our door is always open and I think

00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:56,910
this program is really cool so yeah

00:42:52,940 --> 00:43:00,240
thank you again one extra thought if

00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:02,880
people want to join the slack channel or

00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,980
the discourse have we put those links

00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,170
together in the ether pad or maybe we

00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:09,480
can look those up and if there's

00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:11,849
anything else they need to do so there's

00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:15,990
is that right there's a public slack and

00:43:11,849 --> 00:43:17,849
a public disclose all gather up we'll

00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:22,200
gather up those links and share them in

00:43:17,849 --> 00:43:25,200
the ether pad yeah that's great yeah

00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:28,619
thank you thank you happy thank you I

00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,599
don't want yeah yeah thank you everyone

00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:34,470
looks like this is the end of our like

00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:38,790
