Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: TAXI CAB CONFESSIONS - CASE STUDY ON CONNECTING DRUPAL AS DISPATCH APP
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	Today's mobile devices have taken over as the most cost-effective and scalable way to replace legacy hardware solutions, as well as paper solutions, that were both clunky and expensive for users. One taxicab company -- Green Cab of Madison -- has adopted Apple iPads as their vehicle meter and communication device in their Toyota Prius green cabs. Their iPads are outfitted with a mobile app built on Drupal that enables them to collect real-time vehicle location data, to alert drivers of new calls, and to complete credit card transactions. Promet Source has built the iPad app for Green Cab Madison to help them take advantage of mobile technology and optimize their business. We will describe the module used in setting this system up, as well as discuss many challenges that arose during this project and how we have solved them. We will also discuss the tool selection for programming the iPads, and the pros and cons of native and hybrid solutions.

Questions answered by this session: 
How Drupal was leveraged for rapid development of the base dispatch application
Why Drupal was the right choice for integrating with native and hybrid mobile apps
Where Drupal can be used for enterprise mobile application development
Best practices for security when connecting Drupal to mobile devices
Methodology for connecting the iPads to the Drupal services module
