Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: MAKING DRUPAL CORE MOBILE-FRIENDLY
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	Drupal Eight needs to be mobile-friendly. One of the tasks in the core Mobile Initiative is to bring a quality user experience to the administration interface in line with the expectations set by native applications. This session covers the challenges, pitfalls, and potential solutions for the initiative, as well as outlining future road maps and how you can get involved. Bartik and Seven are also being transformed into device-independent, responsive designs. This session details the challenges involved in providing out-of-the-box responsiveness in core themes, how we are solving these challenges, and what the future might hold beyond current solutions.

Questions answered by this session: 
What problems and pain points do we face bringing a complex web application like Drupal on to mobile devices?
Mobile devices have unique characteristics and capabilities. How can we design to take advantage of this?
How are we implementing HTML5, CSS3, and media queries in Drupal core?
What are our cross-device, cross-platform, cross-browser testing strategies?
How can someone get involved in core design and theme development? How can someone help make Drupal 8 better?

                                   Luis and I really want to make this a an                               interactive discussion you get to talk                               about things that you want to see in                               Drupal                                                              with in Drupal                                                        in Drupal                                                          mobile solutions and we'll be talking                                about sort of the goals of the                                initiative so far and I just like to say                                that the goals of the initiative are are                                driven by the community needs and by                                community participation so I'm John                                Alden welcomes hi I'm a Louis Lyman I                                web for capgemini am a designer and a                                front-end developer yeah suppose I                                should say who I work for two I work                                with palantir done it there's a                                chicago-based company great group of                                people so the Drupal                                                    is a specific initiative within the                                Drupal a sphere there is there are see                                how many people about six initiatives                                right now for Drupal                                                   various sort of features key features at                                drews would like to see in Drupal                                      as you saw from his keynote on Tuesday                                he's really really wants Drupal                                        mobile friendly and that's one of my                                goals too and when you start thinking                                about what does that mean you you have                                to look at sort of how mobile solutions                                are being built right now and there are                                a lot of different ways of doing stuff                                there's native apps there's html                                     apps there are sort of the the mobile                                site desktop site switching back and                                forth between domains there's responsive                                design there's also something booski                                coined is the arrests responsive design                                plus server-side components Drupal                                  should be able to support all of those                                there's no reason we should pick choose                                one over the other because we want it to                                be a generalized platform then that can                                work for anybody right and when you                                start looking at the sort of things that                                we need in Drupal                                                       down to we need web services html                                     those are actually underneath existing                                initiatives there's a web services                                initiative and core context which is                                you've probably heard it called whiskey                                he's saw Larry Garfield in the blue                                shirt on the video and raises keynote                                he's running that then jaysene is                                running the html                                                  working very closely with the other                                initiatives because our our goals sort                                of overlap so the only way that Drupal                                  will succeed as a mobile friendly                                platform is evolve our initiative                                succeed so so those first two points                                aren't just different initiatives but                                feel free to talk about anything mobile                                because like I said we're working                                together so even if it's not technically                                within the bit that I'm leading it                                doesn't really matter I'll talk to Larry                                or talk to JC and we'll get it all sort                                of sorted out so the things that are                                actually under the mobile initiative are                                responsive themes converting all the                                existing themes to be responsive front                                and performance because of such so                                crucial to having a mobile mobile                                solution and documentation this is one                                because mobile is so new everybody's                                sort of learning stuff right now they're                                still trying to figure stuff out and one                                great way to participate as a new person                                in the mobile sphere is ask you figure                                stuff out to write it down so we've                                started a documentation guide on                                drupal.org for anything mobile and it's                                got native app stuff it has you know web                                app responsive design front end                                performance all of that stuff is on                                there and you know anybody of any                                experience level can contribute to                                documentation and then the last thing is                                actually the one of the most this is the                                first thing that you see when you                                install a Drupal site is the admin side                                the admin screens are setting it up so                                yeah so a big part of my work has been                                on the admin to face the Drupal and so                                 as well as making Drupal                                 a good framework a good tool for making                                 mobile apps it should also be a good                                 mobile app in itself so we've been doing                                 a lot of work rethinking Drupal's admin                                 interface so it's usable on small                                 screens and touchscreen devices so when                                 we release du Palais you can offer this                                 to your clients as a CMS that they can                                 use anywhere they want and it's also                                 great for us because I was always in                                 other situations with my freelance                                 clients were emailing me or texted me                                 saying I broken something you know                                 please Victor now and I wasn't always on                                 my computer so I was back in Drupal                                   when I was trying to use a tiny little                                 phone to make some changes and it was                                 absolute pain yeah so um yeah I really                                 come around on that the mobile-friendly                                 admin side because at first I was like                                 wow that sounds kind of hard I'm not                                 sure if we necessarily need to do that                                 um but it really it's the first thing                                 you see and in just like with Drupal                                   where we replaced all the the crappy                                 things that were in Drupal                                              was a you know first thing as a designer                                 you saw when you install Drupal                                       themes were much better same thing with                                 the administrative interface for Drupal                                                                                                      experience right out of the box ago hey                                 look at this this is nice first                                 impressions matter so that's why it's                                 important that this part is the Drupal                                   solution yeah it's actually been really                                 interesting if you approach the design                                 of the CMS or mobile first perspective                                 because it's kind of forcing us to                                 rethink drupal's interface with more                                 simplicity which and some of those like                                 some of those efforts have actually                                 fallen back into the desktop design as                                 well yeah I i just want to point out                                 that the the initiative homepage                                 basically is on groups drupal.org /                                 mobile / drupal dash                                                where there's a list of all of the                                 bosoms a link to like the documentation                                 page there's a strategy Paige there as                                 well there's the list of all the actual                                 issues an issue queue that are related                                 to the new mobile initiative and we have                                 postings about regular office hours and                                 IRC meeting said we have but I really                                 want people to like jump up now and                                 start asking                                 questions about and are making comments                                 about your mobile experiences in dribble                                                                                                         see or questions you have about the                                 initiative so ah whoops you are right                                 let me fix that slide right now thank                                 you yeah there's a microphone in the                                 center that might help you well I can                                 repeat the question because we're                                 recording and so the question was what's                                 your definition of a mobile device in                                 worded and tablets fit in the equation                                 so I go for it that's a really                                 interesting question because the term                                 mobile could be interpreted by you know                                 so many people as different things I                                 used to mean a mobile phone but the                                 definition of that keeps changing every                                 year or we could interpret it to mean a                                 mobile device one that you carry around                                 with you and if you think of it in a                                 broader definition like that then it                                 includes you know phones or tablets                                 e-readers really anything that laptop oh                                 yeah you have to ask to work on them as                                 well but um there's really so many                                 factors that affect devices nowadays                                 it's really hard to put them in classes                                 like this is a mobile this is a tablet                                 because there's so much in between those                                 two definitions yeah I think as far as                                 the initiative goes we're looking at                                 making sure that Drupal works with you                                 know different sized screens so smaller                                 screens and then we traditionally been                                 sort of targeting as well as touch                                 interfaces and and those sort of device                                 capabilities that we're targeting can                                 apply to whatever the actual device                                 happens to be right because it's                                 important that you sort of think about                                 device capabilities instead of actual                                 devices so especially because drew poo a                                 isn't going to come out for another year                                 yeah and then it's like a slice pan is                                 going to be at least another                                 five right so we can't really be                                 thinking about what devices do now we                                 just have to think about what they could                                 do or just do as much feature detection                                 as possible hey you don't have to come                                 up you can you can just sort of yeah the                                 backend of Drupal is very sort of heavy                                 the stack and that the back end                                 performance is also a big consideration                                 so uh I I will agree with you and also                                 sort of counter to in that when you look                                 at sort of the traditional waterfall                                 model graphs of loading a particular                                 webpage there's you know so many seconds                                 for how long it takes for the HTML to                                 load and then all of the assets the                                 images the JavaScript's the CSS those                                 always take much longer than that                                 initial HTML page because it's just one                                 HTTP request for the HTML page and it's                                 multiple ways to be requests so there's                                 a lot of there's a lot of back and forth                                 between the servicing you take much                                 longer for that stuff to go out so                                 that's why it's actually an easier way                                 to optimize your site is to focus on                                 front end performance you know it's but                                 this is a part where I agree with you                                 now that was the counter and now account                                 agreement you're absolutely right yes                                 yeah so the web services initiative is                                 absolutely looking at that issue because                                 they agree that the Drupal stack is very                                 heavy and has the the bootstrap in                                 Drupal                                                                   understand                                 so they're working on revamping that in                                 order to be able to basically request                                 what we what we now think of as a page                                 you'd be able to request basically                                 pieces of a page and be able to get that                                 much quicker and that's part of the the                                 conversion to Symphony using the                                 symphony components so I'm hoping the                                 web services initiative will be a will                                 succeed and improve massively the                                 backend performance of triple in the                                 white back there sir yeah did you say                                 background images respond adaptive                                 images okay                                 yes now I come I'm sorry so that for the                                 people watching the video the comment                                 the question first was is there any are                                 we looking at adaptive images for Drupal                                                                                                     about oh and about whether or not the                                 initiative included drupal.org                                 improvements in order to make it mobile                                 friendly because the drupal.org website                                 is not currently very friendly and he                                 commented saying that you know the                                 reeses comment about nobody post                                 screenshots of iPhones well nobody posts                                 screens of iphones because my phone                                 users can't use drupal.org comments very                                 well I've tried that tried to go through                                 the issue queue in the Drupal                                   initiative and leggy use it from a phone                                 it's really hard and I technically it's                                 not part of the initiative because we're                                 focused on Drupal                                                       infrastructure code but it's something                                 it's it's one of those sort of                                 tangential things that I feel like                                 talking about Drupal                                                     sort of kicks off a discussion about                                 drupal.org infrastructure and I've seen                                 some sort of action being started to                                 take so you can actually find there's a                                 there is there are a couple issues right                                 now on the issue queue for drupal.org                                 infrastructure talking about improving                                 the you know being able to like post                                 comments on issues from your phone for                                 example making the entire site more                                 responsive I feel like we can get the                                 the issue queue stuff done a bit quicker                                 than the entire making the entire theme                                 responsive right but and then with                                 reductive images yeah we're definitely                                 looking at that adaptive image is a                                 really complex problem if you look at                                 the the web design community in general                                 it this is a big discussion                                 and and there's no perfect solution                                 right so Jason Grigsby gives a great                                 discussion of the problem space of                                 adapted images so if you're not familiar                                 with all of the sort of cookie and                                 JavaScript and browser prefetching                                 issues about around images you go to                                 cloud                                                                   posts that he did last I want to say                                 November ish time frame about responsive                                 images that are excellent and describe                                 the promise space so with Drupal                                   basically we're watching sort of the                                 development of Drupal                                                responsive images we're also watching                                 the greater design web design community                                 to see what solutions they come up with                                 I'm part of the there's a w                                             talking about responsive images around                                 the the picture tag this proposal and                                 we're watching everything and we're                                 going to try to pick the best solution                                 for Drupal                                                        solutions that have been proposed Matt                                 Wilcox has an adaptive images solution                                 which i think is the would be the best                                 fit for Drupal in in the way the Drupal                                 works so there may be other solutions                                 that work better for other types of                                 systems but I think that one would work                                 best for jable that's why I'm kind of                                 leaning towards but it's it's a little                                 early to but it's something that if                                 people want to start working on that to                                 give us a leg up on those particular                                 issues that would be great so like if                                 you want let me jump over to anyway I                                 just quickly jumped back to the Jupiter                                 question if you've seen the drupal                                 association roadmap for this year it's                                 on their list to make Jupiter org                                 responsive so it's probably going to be                                 one of those things where they pay an                                 agency to just get it done but I can't                                 speak for them                                 and i like to say if there's stuff that                                 you guys would love to participate in                                 we're actually doing a mobile initiative                                 Sprint's on friday and it's actually in                                 this room so it starts at nine but she'd                                 if you've been out partying the night                                 before you don't have to show up till                                 noon but you know we'll be here most of                                 the day so oh yeah so funny you should                                 ask you know I'm the lat news talk you                                 were just looking at this yes so it's                                 responsive tables is so dependent on the                                 content you have in them there's been                                 lots of examples of reflow in the layout                                 or hiding some of the columns that only                                 works for certain kinds of data in some                                 situations some people have said that                                 it's better to show the content in a                                 graph or in a list format so in some                                 cases the table markup is only going to                                 get you so far especially for smaller                                 screens so possibly some of the                                 solutions here might have to be in                                 JavaScript or server side to completely                                 reformat the data to be more friendly                                 for smaller screens but it really does                                 depend on the content you're showing                                 yeah and                                 yeah so the permissions page is a bit                                 like a black hole on desktop so for                                 mobile we I'm kind of believing that                                 near the end and do everything else                                 first because if I get drawn into that                                 then nothing else will get done we'll                                 spend the whole year trying to work that                                 page out but further pages when we have                                 like listings of content or list of                                 menus or content types they will send                                 tables and I'm actually thinking that                                 really we can probably set them in ul's                                 and get away with it by the way if                                 there's any UX people here and you would                                 love a challenge we have this                                 permissions page that really needs some                                 love next year                                 so so the question was that I'll get a                                 lot of the newer phones support html                                  which are great in as far as you know                                 having nice sort of rich widgets etc for                                 applications and the question was what                                 about sort of older phones that don't                                 support html                                                             the nice thing that that you want I                                 wanted well I was just going to say                                 progressive enhancement progressive                                 enhancement progressive a little way                                 right so we're going to design a nice                                 interface with touchscreen devices but                                 it's all going to be done conditionally                                 so we'll need unload a touch family                                 interface if there's actually touch                                 screens available to take a bunch of it                                 otherwise we're just gonna keep a really                                 basic for gum phones yeah in addition to                                 that though the html                                                     html                                                                 mind so any html                                                       is sort of especially form witches they                                 are all backwards compatible with old                                 browsers in that if if you pick a date                                 html                                                                   in a I think it's a text area or some                                 basic text again it just becomes a basic                                 text area on any browser that doesn't                                 understand it because it's a type so its                                 input type I forget what it is date                                 right so if it doesn't understand the                                 type it still displays the widget but it                                 just uses its default which is text it                                 does a text input yeah it's really great                                 the the design of the html                                           made to gracefully degrade for devices                                 or browsers that don't understand it so                                 luckily grupal doesn't really have to do                                 a whole lot except for the progressive                                 enhancement that those are talking about                                 I thought I saw some other hands but                                 I've lost who was holding up their hands                                 you're just drinking water                                 so let me talk about briefly about some                                 of the responsive stuff that we're                                 working on we've already dropped garland                                 from Drupal                                                             blade so and so that means the themes                                 that are left are stark                                              we're going to be converting all of                                 those to be responsive the first one                                 we're tackling of course is stark                                 because it's our you know sort of lean                                 theme that only has like a little bit of                                 layout CSS so that's what we've just                                 finished doing that and sort of in the                                 RT bcq now waiting for some sort of core                                 commuters to review it and get it in to                                 core but Luke Wroblewski actually did a                                 post last week about multi-device layout                                 pattern city song and it turns out that                                 that this is the pattern that's going to                                 be for stark so basically you've got you                                 know your main content here first                                 sidebar second sidebar and it gets                                 smaller the second side bar drops down                                 to here when it's when the second side                                 bar drops down to here rather than just                                 having the blocks be super wide across                                 which is effectively a three column grid                                 we are laying out the blocks that are in                                 that region in a three column grid so                                 let me first block psycho popular block                                                                                                         down like that and then this is just                                 regular sort of mobile single column                                 there this is it's it's sort of neat to                                 see the work that we did be fit in                                 nicely with what Luke was from noticing                                 in there the responsive layouts but I                                 actually gave a talk yesterday about the                                 limitations of regent bay                                 layouts and there's only so much you can                                 do from a from a theme that is going to                                 be sort of distributed to end users                                 where you don't know what the end user                                 is actually going to what they don't                                 know we don't know what content they're                                 actually going to put into those themes                                 right so the most ideal way of doing a                                 responsive site is is really dependent                                 on what type of content you have in your                                 sidebars for example what type of                                 content do you have every where right so                                 we're sort of stuck with trying to do                                 age sort of generic responsive to layout                                 as based on regions and you know I                                 talked about how yesterday how you can                                 if you're doing a custom theme for your                                 own site it's possible to do basically                                 field-based layouts which are much more                                 interesting but can be really tailored                                 to the specific needs of the site and                                 then sort of next step in my thinking is                                 that I don't know how you could do                                 field-based layouts when you don't know                                 what kind of feels the particular site                                 is going to have when you don't know                                 that you end use case so I would love if                                 if you know everybody everybody hears                                 wus interested in responsive design sort                                 of thinking about that issue as well or                                 you know maybe I'm just sort of                                 overthinking in does anybody have any                                 comments about about this pattern or or                                 doing region-based responsive layouts                                 sorry was that how'd it yet it reacts to                                 right to left in the traditional way                                 that that websites should do right to                                 left in that the entire layout is                                 flipped for you know in addition to the                                 language being right to left the layout                                 gets flipped right to left that's so                                 that's the way we wrote it the first                                 dark already so as I built in was it                                 about RTL so well actually in this first                                 one this this is the first sidebar the                                 first sorry would actually be over here                                 and the second side bar would be over                                 here because as you're reading right to                                 left this is the first side bar and                                 that's the second item are right so and                                 then here the content would be over here                                 the first side bar would be here and the                                 second side bar would still be in the                                 same place it you're right and the s so                                 the the blocks instead of being from                                 left to right laid out and this three                                 column grid would also be right to left                                 so one two three four five six yeah                                 so the the question who is sorry babe                                 sorry I got the first part of the men i                                 miss in a second part so the question                                 was do we put the media queries bake                                 them into the cs CSS or are they some                                 other wise you know exposed inside                                 settings or or well i guess would have                                 to be through settings because like                                 omega and adaptive themes expose the                                 actual break points inside the settings                                 correct so yeah what                                 so there are two issues there should we                                 have some sort of settings in Drupal                                   core for four break points and you know                                 how's the best to do that stark is                                 designed to show off Drupal's default                                 markup that's that's what its purposes                                 the layout has always been just to show                                 you you know is an example basically of                                 how you can lay out your site it wasn't                                 really meant to be something that's                                 super flexible or reusable you can reuse                                 it you can modify it to do what you want                                 but that wasn't that isn't sort of the                                 goal of having the layout for stark so                                 having settings for stark for where the                                 breakpoints are I don't think is a                                 particularly                                 that's interesting so the comment was                                 you know could you do it's in a way such                                 that Starks work can be sort of reused                                 for partek I hadn't really given that                                 much thought the themes are so so                                 different that I'm not sure there's not                                 really a whole lot of work in stark so I                                 think that the amount of CSS is in                                 Bartok already you basically have to                                 look start with that the weight is now                                 and start with that code rather than                                 trying to reuse some of the stuff that's                                 in stark so so in regards to the                                 settings one of the problems from a                                 front-end performance issue is that if                                 you have your media query inside the                                 link tag or inside the media attribute                                 of the you know at import that's a bad                                 performance hit and the reason for that                                 is because it breaks it it conflicts                                 with Drupal CSS aggregation because it                                 can only aggregate files that have the                                 same media type so each media query                                 that's in a media attribute means a                                 separate aggregate file and a separate                                 HTTP request so the way that we've                                 handled it for stark is that yes the the                                 media query is actually baked into the                                 layout dot CSS file because there's no                                 performances so putting a setting in we                                 would have to look at we'd have to                                 figure out a way to avoid that                                 performance problem so                                 the second let me let me recap first and                                 then you ask question because it's just                                 for the video so so I don't forget                                 everything she said so we pointed out                                 that the lot of times looking at this                                 region based layout if you put                                 navigation in the second side bar when                                 you start getting to some of these other                                 responsive designs where the the                                 navigation basically drops below                                 everything else it can really sort of                                 wreak havoc with a user experience and                                 make it difficult for a user and and                                 some mobile sites have a button at the                                 top that allow you to to get to the                                 navigation easily and now the question                                 yeah so that the so the question is what                                 solutions can we come up with Andrew                                 polite I would love to have you to think                                 about that and maybe help come up with                                 some of the solutions one of the things                                 that I've been thinking about a little                                 bit is that we do have a a skip to                                 navigation button that's in all of our                                 markup it's in the HTML dot TPL file                                 right now it's basically hidden unless                                 it gets keyboard focus you could write                                 some CSS so that it was exposed as a                                 button to jump to the navigation for                                 mobile sites I really like that solution                                 because it's it's it's a sort of                                 accessibility and mobile win at the same                                 time so that would be one way that you                                 could do it and as far as start goes I                                 don't the issue is when you add a menu                                 to a region the the markup that comes in                                 HTML TPL doesn't necessarily know what                                 what's the name of the menu in which                                 menu is important and so it doesn't know                                 which block it should be jumping to so                                 that's really tricky for a theme that's                                 distributed and we don't know what                                 blocks are going into the actual regions                                 but yeah                                 um                                 so the the question the comment was you                                 could you put the the second sidebar we                                 instead of below it put it up at the top                                 is that what you were saying okay there                                 are some interesting things that you can                                 do with responsive layouts that are not                                 necessarily obvious if I would recommend                                 actually I I gave a like maybe talked                                 about this for about                                                  decision yesterday when the video comes                                 out watch that I should help you sort of                                 figure out or help to figure out sort of                                 responsive layout things because these                                 three elements this first sidebar                                 seconds I bar and content are next to                                 each other in the source order there are                                 some things you can do to to push those                                 around and make them appear to be out of                                 order even though it has a certain order                                 in the HTML I've talked about when                                 you're creating basically rose inside                                 your grid each each group of elements                                 that are in a single row should be next                                 to each other in the source order and so                                 since these are all three next to each                                 other you can rearrange them within that                                 row the thing that you can't do well see                                 you like use some fancy it's very tricky                                 to try and get CSS to almost disobey the                                 HTML source order and I think I've seen                                 a couple of them using like display                                 table and display table header to try                                 and move stuff above to the top which is                                 you know a bit of a hack but i think the                                 m the flexbox spec for css                                            powerful and once that's fully supported                                 then you can do some really powerful                                 stuff with it yeah yeah that's that's                                 another option so                                 the more complicated issue would                                 basically be that we still don't know                                 what blocks and what regions are most                                 important for the particular user is                                 using the theme so we can't we can't you                                 know it's just too difficult to like                                 know there is possible like if you                                 wanted to have like multiple layouts                                 that the user could pick from if                                 somebody wanted to work on that as an                                 issue for a stark so you could like say                                 oh I want to use this kind of responsive                                 layout or this kind of responsibly out I                                 would totally up for that I would need                                 to like argue a little bit of with a web                                 Jake I think but I'd be willing to argue                                 with her in order to get that hand                                 well that's the question was do it do i                                 mean the the mobile user when i talk                                 about what most important or the                                 developer what things are most important                                 that's an excellent reminder that you                                 should always think about your users                                 first right it's that what the users                                 think is most important that should be                                 sort of near the top in your source                                 order those are most important things                                 that's why they came to your site but                                 from a site builder standpoint the the                                 theme doesn't that we're going to assume                                 that the site builder knows to respect                                 the users so as as a you know a sort of                                 generic theme we have no way of knowing                                 what blocks what important things get                                 put into what places because we come                                 with a default set of blocks like then                                 the main content and you know some some                                 menus and stuff like that but the site                                 builder can move that stuff around and                                 that doesn't necessarily it won't                                 necessarily be where drupal initially                                 places it so that's that's the sort of                                 crux of the matter yeah I misunderstood                                 then                                 oh okay yeah i did miss sunshine okay so                                 you're asking whether I meant for the                                 settings of the layout settings whether                                 his per user or I'm actually actually                                 what I was referring to was site builder                                 I mean per site right so the the site                                 builder says oh I want to use this                                 layout for the site rather than you know                                 the default layout and that would be                                 based on you know because the site                                 builder knows where did I stick this                                 stuff which layout responsibly hell                                 makes more sense for my particular site                                 yes that's sorry yes so I know you guys                                 have more comments tell me you tell us                                 about some of the Drupal                                              you've done that you think is                                 interesting or are that you think is                                 really painful or hard because knowing                                 the things that are causing you pain is                                 really helpful because then we can you                                 know put some bandaid on it or you know                                 fix it or whatever right I'll just throw                                 up there one of the things that that I                                 find painful is the field TPL it'd be                                 really nice to have a much leaner markup                                 coming out of Drupal because that's a                                 that's a friend and performance problem                                 too many markup means extra k of                                 downloading so I think there's a lot of                                 improvement that we can do on this if                                 they're people would like to work on                                 this particular problem I I would say                                 take a look at the defense's module and                                 drupal                                                                  and you can certainly try to maybe make                                 make it solution better or work on your                                 own solution and and maybe we can sort                                 of solve this sort of field mark a                                 problem in jubilate I would like I                                 wouldn't I would love to see some                                 solution for that and drupal                                   technically they'd be part of the html                                  initiative but like I said we're not                                 really worried about which issue goes in                                 which initiative it's                                 these are mobile issues and let's get                                 them solved yeah                                 and so let me do the question for so                                 they the comment was in Drupal there's                                 nested menus and how how do you sort of                                 best support a user interface inside                                 mobile devices that correct okay yeah so                                 I from the lower the studies we've done                                 for the admin interface is really common                                 in mobile os's to have nested navigation                                 using either accordions that I didn't                                 show the sub items or actually having                                 separate screens for each one those are                                 some of the techniques they use to                                 communicate that information yeah yeah                                 that's really comment on iOS is a great                                 example you separate screens for each                                 and nested set of items um other people                                 here UX people or just sort of the                                 usability people that want to talk about                                 the the admin interface and improving                                 that and you know you've got a yeah a                                 prototype of what the Drupal                                       backend might look like why don't we                                 show that in right now yeah okay let's                                 do that so I can begin this with a quick                                 story about a year ago when I was really                                 young and naive I am I wasn't really                                 into cool development or anything like                                 that and at the time responsive web                                 design was cool so I was like oh I know                                 this might be seven theme responsive                                 happy fun so when we go into it we                                 actually realized that the admin                                 interface in Drupal was really bad on                                 mobile phones so is there jumping into                                 the issue queue we decided to take a                                 step back and enjoy book on London we                                 did a usability sprint where we got tons                                 of devices together and we saw where the                                 pain points were and we got a lot of bad                                 stuff out there and since then what                                 we've been trying to do is instead of                                 committing issue                                 decor is designed a prototype in static                                 HTML of how it could work on small and                                 touchscreen devices and the benefits do                                 that is that we don't have to write a                                 lot of PHP to change interface which is                                 great because i suck at PHP so it's                                 really easy to contribute and it kind of                                 avoids having bike-share discussions on                                 how we implement a certain feature we                                 can just focus on how it works to the                                 user and the other good thing about                                 having a proper usable prototype is                                 people can get out on their phones and                                 they can use it and they can touch and                                 swipe through it and see how it feels so                                 this this here is the third iteration of                                 the prototype which focuses on just                                 navigating to the page you want to get                                 to so the first thing you notice is that                                 the toolbar doesn't really have any                                 links in because we found that it just                                 collapses down gets really big and it                                 takes up about half the page for EM for                                 mobile users so what we have in here is                                 the title of the page you're on and we                                 have a link that says a minister when                                 you click on that it takes it to the top                                 of the administration menu so you see                                 content structure appearance people and                                 when you click down through these you                                 drill down through the interface so I                                 thought as a lot simpler and we've made                                 the each menu item really big and                                 touchable cuz currently there was I                                 think there's maybe this this one word                                 here that you could click on to get to                                 get down to the next layer so we made                                 this whole area clickable and touch                                 friendly and then from there to get back                                 up you have to press the back button to                                 go all the way back up to the top so                                 what we decided to do was instead of                                 making users to em forcing them to click                                 this one button down here we made the                                 whole screen a target so if you want to                                 get back up to this previous page you                                 just pull and swipe which is a lot                                 better because instead of tapping one                                 button down here you've got the whole                                 screen to touch and you can actually                                 move a lot quicker than just having one                                 button like that whether the back button                                 is a you know                                 part of the device you I so it it's                                 inconsistent across device as well and                                 well back to placement so and there was                                 some discussion at first about having                                 the back button in the top toolbar                                 because they do that on iOS but it kind                                 of seemed like a waste of space because                                 a lot of mobile browsers have these bad                                 but anyway you can also swipe forward as                                 well let's go back down from where you                                 were so what we also did is instead of                                 having all the oh you click on it yeah                                 yeah so it tells you what page you're on                                 at the top of the toolbar has the title                                 maybe that's not completely consistent                                 but when you go down and it tells you so                                 so the question was how how do you know                                 whether when you're on a particular page                                 and you you I saw it back to how does it                                 know how                                 I it is it's just going through the                                 browser history when you're swiping                                 forward right is that right now we're                                 talking like that is literally the same                                 as pressing the back button is that what                                 you mean yeah so you swipe back and then                                 you swipe forward it's just using the                                 browser history to go forward right yeah                                 yeah so you can't swipe forward you                                 can't swipe fold into the future it                                 won't no way you want to go right so ya                                 know the question was can you can you                                 get all the way back to the top of the                                 administration Revere in a deep menu and                                 somebody said to swipe very card so no                                 at the moment you would have to swipe                                 six times but that you know there are                                 improvements to be made on this                                 prototype and if you have any                                 suggestions that's great you should come                                 to the sprint on Friday                                 so for content creation I'm going to                                 repeat the question so content creation                                 is there going to be a special a special                                 mobile setup versus the the desktop so                                 it's an interesting use case to think                                 about maybe having a specific UI for                                 certain roles but for the this like web                                 interface we kind of have to think about                                 every possible role because we can't                                 assume what they use and what the user                                 will want to do but in the future once                                 we have this working really well maybe                                 we can explore making native apps that                                 have very specific use cases I know                                 there's an iOS up at the moment called                                 dhrupad and that only gives you a                                 handful of functions or features to use                                 by content creation and you can exclude                                 all the other ones because they don't                                 have to be accessible for this one                                 application so it it's something I'm                                 happy to discuss in the initiative but i                                 think that the back end web interface                                 has to do everything yeah the goal is                                 really didn't have everything be                                 mobile-friendly including the                                 permissions page that's the goal yeah                                 because it ages it doesn't make sense to                                 assume that the mobile user doesn't want                                 to do everything right so we don't want                                 to limit it based on faulty assumptions                                 yeah we can't Lucy anybody can look at                                 this prototype right what's the URL for                                 that right oh I should type it down so                                 it's nav three dots d                                                 see if I can pull up a mm-hmm how big                                 can i make my text this                                 increase the fun on that at all oh it's                                 pretty limited feature say isn't it                                 there we go font size way bigger pick a                                 big a big plus about eight more times so                                 yeah you guys can try all this prototype                                 go to it right now on your mobile device                                 you can try it out but be warned that it                                 could be buggy because it's not it's not                                 a fully featured piece of code and so my                                 javascript does really suck yeah                                 yeah so so the the comment was that and                                 Drupal it's really hard to administer                                 large numbers of users on the user                                 administration page because there's no                                 easy way to search for user by their                                 username and I assume you want to know                                 how we're fixing that for a Jew plate                                 yeah so one of the benefits of looking                                 at the interface from my mobile                                 perspective is it makes those problems                                 so much more obvious you've got a large                                 amount of users yeah and the key was                                 commenting that he ain't on small site                                 with only like                                                           manage it okay on a desktop or just                                 going through a couple pages but with a                                 thousand users it's almost impossible                                 yeah it's tricky and I would say within                                 a mobile device even a hundred users is                                 difficult yes you might notice this                                 search button on every page so what we                                 also found is it does take a while to                                 swipe around to get back up to the top                                 to find the right menu item to get down                                 to where you want to go so we actually                                 implemented this global search function                                 and you can type any page oh no I said                                 thus beginning letters for any page in                                 the admin to face like if i type c it                                 will show me every page that i can get                                 to in the admin interface so it's just                                 like a global search in Drupal almost                                 like you have spotlight in iOS or in OS                                 X but what it also does is it doubles up                                 as a local search so you can see here it                                 shows you on the current page this user                                 that begins to see if we had thousands                                 of users it will show you every user                                 that began with c or if you want getting                                 more specific you can type in here you                                 know see lu and until until you find                                 just that one user was it using some                                 really badly heck java script that I                                 wrote ideally m well yeah it looks like                                 it works really well but I'm sure we'll                                 break very easily if you try and do                                 anything else with it so I know this is                                 part of the static issue this is static                                 HTML and this is why it's great because                                 then I don't have to know how to do it                                 properly in order to show this interface                                  after everyone but it's gonna be part of                                  our M work in issue queue to get this                                  functionality into Drupal core yeah yeah                                  is it what was it Oh user finder in                                  Drupal                                                                there I'm not not sure yeah you know                                  like it like I said earlier that the                                  goal is to have all the administrative                                  interface converted to be mobile                                  friendly the thing that we're going to                                  start with first are going to be content                                  creation and content administration and                                  when I say content what I'm specifically                                  talking about from a sort of code still                                  code standpoint is entities so like                                  nodes content types you know creating                                  content but also users are also had to                                  do so user administration and and user                                  creation is sort of part of what i                                  consider content administration and                                  content creation because users are also                                  entities so well                                  well I mean yeah I mean that's one of                                  the things that that loser has been                                  working on is the navigation of course                                  is essential it's it's got to be                                  actually first because you can't get to                                  any of the content creation pages and                                  before you have navigation so                                  I disagree completely so the question                                  was you're not going to create content                                  on your mobile device that's part of the                                  assumptions that use I would love to                                  rate create draft posts when i'm on the                                  bus yeah that's content creation now I                                  guess it's important to know that's a                                  question I'm sorry                                  so yeah so so for the video listeners                                  the comment and question was basically                                  you know as we look at all of the the                                  administrative interfaces for mobile                                  users what sort of how are we looking at                                  sort of the desktop picture and                                  improving that as well at the same time                                  it do you want to yeah so am like I said                                  before one of the benefits of taking a                                  view on the interface on mobile is it                                  makes some problems that we have already                                  in the desktop interface so much more                                  obvious so optimistically I'd say we                                  have one hundred percent rain on                                  changing the desktop interface as well                                  if it makes the mobile interface easier                                  or who knows it might even made a                                  desktop interface a lot better to use as                                  well yeah we had if you remember the d                                   UX project some of the community members                                  that were working on that Bo Hahn and                                  Roy Scholten they are doing you know                                  they're continuing with their work and                                  improving the administrative interface                                  for Drupal                                                               not sure what is it da ux or something                                  like that or they had little us yeah Dax                                  but they're working closely with us                                  because they recognize the implications                                  of mobile for improving the desktop so                                  like I said we're trying to make                                  everything better and the sort of                                  different initiatives overlap a lot and                                  we're basically we're all working                                  together so so exactly Roy was actually                                  at the sprint that we had Sunday and                                  Monday before the drupalcon and helped                                  out a lot and it was great so definitely                                  the desktop experience is going to                                  improve because we're taking mobile into                                  consideration ok                                  yeah so the comment was that he likes to                                  think of desktop as being a progressive                                  enhancement of the base base                                  functionality Haney yeah I completely                                  agree that's how I love to think of it                                  as a larger screen as an additional                                  capability like you would think of                                  JavaScript as an additional capability                                  so if we design for a small screen first                                  then we'll be in a much better place                                  so the right so the question is a bit                                  about the politics of getting particular                                  changes into core and whether or not we                                  can do it so the nice thing about you                                  know these sort of official initiatives                                  that are put together in the in the                                  Drupal community is that you know                                  basically there's no official                                  initiatives that are created without                                  drees saying i want this right so the                                  mobile industry of is because trees says                                  he wants drupal to be mobile friendly                                  and it's up to us to figure out what                                  that means and so yeah we've got some                                  heavyweights who are in favor of making                                  Drupal a mobile-friendly I think if we                                  have a pretty good shot of changing sort                                  of the desktop experience and and you                                  know the people that have traditionally                                  been working on the desktop they're also                                  on board like I said the d                                             they're doing d                                                     they're lovin improving the desktop from                                  the mobile so I actually don't think                                  there's going to be that hard to from a                                  political standpoint of you know sort of                                  fighting herbed issue queue back and                                  forth I think the hard part is actually                                  just doing the xword you know finding                                  the right people to start implementing                                  the UX work as PHP and HTML and I would                                  love to see everybody who has those                                  skills to get involved again we have                                  this another sprint on Friday we                                  actually be in this room and I think I'm                                  going to take one last question                                  so the question was look that the d d                                   nav                                                                   great in an iphone and does it scale to                                  an ipad i don't know have you tried an                                  ipad yeah find somebody has an ipad and                                  try it on there you know this is a                                  prototype Al's working on right now you                                  want to go look out look over there and                                  again this is a prototype                                                really the process of a green fairy is                                  really starting with a smaller screen                                  experience and then once we have that                                  down then yeah let's start thinkin about                                  bigger screens they're bigger touch                                  screens because ipad apps tend to have                                  slightly different method fools as well                                  so even though it might translate over                                  okay it might not be ideal so I'm sure                                  there's loads of what that we can do on                                  the iPad experience or a tablet
