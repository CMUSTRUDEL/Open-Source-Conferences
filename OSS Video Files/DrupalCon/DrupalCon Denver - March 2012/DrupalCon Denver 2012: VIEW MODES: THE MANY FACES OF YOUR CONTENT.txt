Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: VIEW MODES: THE MANY FACES OF YOUR CONTENT
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	View Modes are a core feature of Drupal 7 entities that most users don't give too much thought to, even though they use them all the time. This is a shame because View Modes are an extraordinarily powerful tool for streamlining the theming and development of your site and ensuring consistency of output for your content. View Modes give the themer the ability to show the same content in many different contexts and with the right display for each situation. Through smart use of View Modes, a themer can avoid having the huge stack of node templates and Views displays that we're used to. In this session, attendees will learn what a View Mode is and how to create custom View Modes both in code and with contributed modules. We'll demonstrate how to set and export display settings for all of your View Modes. We will also spend time looking at the design strategies and types of site elements that View Modes are well suited for. We'll will see how View Modes can change the way you template your nodes, lay out your content, and interact with developers, all for the better.

Questions answered by this session: 
What is a View Mode, and how do I make my own?
How do I export my View Modes to code?
How can View Modes improve my theming practices and collaboration with developers?
What design strategies are View Modes particularly well-suited for?
What other core features and contrib modules do View Modes work well with?

                            structure your designs for a Drupal                                website site builders obviously V modes                                pretty much is a site building thing so                                you're very welcome here awesome people                                if you're awesome you're very welcome                                here and I just apologize in advance                                I say awesome a lot and it's just this                                verbal tic that I've got and that's just                                how it's gonna go so I apologize and so                                awesome people and also developers and                                I'm actually                                I'm actually I'm kidding I'm actually as                                much a developer and also I think femurs                                and developers are kind of the same                                thing it's I don't think this dividing                                line is very useful so yeah I think so                                so that said this isn't going to be a                                very code heavy session there will be a                                little bit of code and there will be a                                link to more code but so if you're                                wanting to get down with like you know                                see tools internals and stuff like that                                that's that's not happening today at                                least not here so and also I'm gonna be                                showing a lot of pictures of cute                                animals and so if you like cute animals                                then this is a good place to be there'll                                be more of that kind of thing here so do                                the little about me                                about two and a half years ago I started                                working for treehouse agency and you                                know over the course of time treehouse                                grew deeper roots and you know went                                through a process of transformation and                                today as of Monday I am a member of                                Phase two and we're very excited about                                where that's going so very happy to                                become part of the phase two family the                                clients that are basically informing                                this talk we did work for the department                                of energy energy gov which we launched                                in August of                                                        we've done on Argonne National Labs                                laboratory excuse me not Nash not labs                                singular both of the the work that we                                did really helped us cut our teeth with                                Drupal                                                               what I'm going to be talking about today                                as for me I'm Tim cosgrove at Drupal org                                I am a fan of being represented as                                myself I don't have an alias or anything                                so I'm Tim cosgrove of Drupal I've been                                a member for                                                       annoying know-it-all teenager in Drupal                                years on Twitter you can find me at Tim                                cosgrove big surprise and you are most                                likely to find code that I've put up on                                github                                rather than gerbil org so I'm Tim                                cosgrove there as well so I assume some                                of you use github github and so and just                                remember that github loves Drupal even                                if Drupal doesn't love github back                                so you know we can talk about that                                another time so what our view modes why                                are we here well V modes are awesome                                thanks                                right haha yeah that was funny sure okay                                few motes are awesome though view modes                                are going to allow you to theme faster                                they will allow you to write less PHP                                and they'll really the main thing is                                that they allow you to create easily                                reusable layouts and all of that is                                going to help you with the other two                                parts basically and we'll get into more                                detail about what I mean by this view                                modes are named ways of displaying                                 entities so you might think of a node as                                 a full page and that's sort of what you                                 think of as a node display and you know                                 we might call that full or default we                                 also might want to have a way to display                                 a photo and a title and that's it we                                 might call that a photo teaser you'll                                 find I use the word teaser a lot I                                 wasn't feeling super creative about the                                 names a dated teaser for example with a                                 date on top and the title small summary                                 but not the full body a subtitle teaser                                 which features of subtitle in addition                                 to the other content the important thing                                 to remember is that these are all                                 different displays of the same note and                                 it's not a special mechanism for picking                                 and choosing fields out of something                                 that you're looking at the node view                                 modes are core there is no there are no                                 contributed modules that you're going to                                 need to do this although there are some                                 that are very helpful view modes have                                 nothing to do with views this is a                                 confusion that we run into view modes                                 are not views although they work very                                 well together with views and we'll be                                 looking at that in fact I might go so                                 far as to say it'll make working with                                 you is much better for you view modes                                 are built into all Drupal                                               no it's obviously taxonomy terms users                                 the rest are slipping my mind but each                                 of those have view modes that you can                                 use to display that entity in different                                 ways in different situations for now I'm                                 gonna be saying note a lot that's partly                                 because I'm an old older Drupal guy I                                 only go back to                                   but just as whenever I do say node in                                 this presentation                                 pretty much in all cases you can also                                 assume that what I say applies to any                                 entity not just notes so we're here                                 because you have problems don't you love                                 hearing that and that great you might                                 not know that you have these problems                                 actually and I could be nicer and say                                 maybe that you have habits that you                                 might want to look at and maybe think                                 about doing things a little bit                                 differently you might want to break                                 these habits so one of them is that you                                 probably have too many templates you                                 probably have way more templates than                                 you need your template PHP is probably                                 out of control it might not be you might                                 be really all tied down but most likely                                 you're writing more in your template PHP                                 or whatever includes that you use to                                 take care of that then you actually need                                 to and you're using views to do theming                                 and that that's actually a sort of                                 problem there are better ways or                                 different ways let's not value judgment                                 things just yet there are different ways                                 of doing that and you might want to                                 consider doing those different way so                                 just again to summarize you use too many                                 templates you write too much PHP and                                 don't take this personally I mean I'm                                 you know this is an abstract to you you                                 use views to do theming these are your                                 problems and you don't have to do that                                 anymore you don't so that's what this                                 talk is going to be about is basically                                 getting you to look at different ways of                                 doing things so just a little bit of                                 history to show us why we're at we're at                                 why we are where we are now how many                                 people have worked in d                                               people did not use CCK in d                                      congratulations that's awesome                                 okay so that that that's good um does                                 anybody did anybody remember hearing                                 about build modes in CC k-                                          neither                                 there's a few of you there's a few of                                 you and your more learning the nine                                 which is great so build modes were part                                 of C CK at least in six I didn't do the                                 research to go see if they went back to                                 five and what they were they were                                 similar to what I said earlier they were                                 named ways to present different displays                                 of nodes in different                                 texts or areas if you manage to enable                                 the UI it looks something like this                                 it gave you the fields that you defined                                 in CCK and it stacked up the build modes                                 that you had defined and it it had a                                 couple problems and this is nothing                                 against CCK those guys are giants and                                 I'm a little flea standing on their                                 shoulder but there were nevertheless                                 problems when you used a build mode by                                 default all the fields were labeled and                                 there was no admin way to turn that off                                 and similar to all CCK the fields were                                 just sort of shoved in there under the                                 body and you had to jump through all                                 kinds of Hoops to make that not happen                                 again you might not be aware that these                                 are hoops but they're further hoops also                                 in the build modes you couldn't trim the                                 body you kind of were stuck unless you                                 did some crazy pre-processing which                                 again we'll talk about pre-processing so                                 we needed more than that we needed more                                 than what CCK gave us out of the box we                                 started using multiple templates for all                                 our nodes and we wrote a ton of                                 pre-processing code to get things into                                 the positions that we wanted to and to                                 modify them a bit and we used views for                                 node output and that specifically for                                 the theming of the nodes we needed to we                                 didn't have the tools that we needed to                                 do it another way                                 so Drupal                                                                I was looking for like a neutral                                 hallelujah kind of thing and you know                                 giddy so so view modes again these are                                 all the same this is all an article type                                 it's a slightly enhanced version of the                                 vanilla article that comes in Drupal                                   core sort of standard install and again                                 we have the sort of node view we also                                 have this photo teaser again which is                                 you know just photo and title this dated                                 teaser and I you know just showing you                                 these different things the important                                 thing to remember here is that these are                                 all the note this there's no special                                 mechanism happening here there's no                                 pre-processing there's no templates                                 there's no views none of that is                                 happening this is just sort of standard                                 poor way of producing output for notes                                 has anyone read The Phantom Tollbooth by                                 any chance it is a fantastic children's                                 book and you should all go buy it after                                 my session sometime and this character                                 is very kind of weird-looking photo this                                 carrot is a minor character called the                                 dodecahedron dodecahedron is a                                          platonic solid and this character had                                 one of those for a head and when he was                                 angry he sort of swept his flip his head                                 around and show you his angry face and                                 when he was sad he'd sort of turned his                                 head around and show you that the point                                 being that he had all these different                                 sides to him but it was always the same                                 person just showing different aspects of                                 himself maybe a more conventional                                 metaphor is a jewel a diamond you sort                                 of hold it in your hand you see all                                 these different things as you look at                                 the different facets but it's still the                                 same jewel                                 and similarly that's what how I want us                                 to think about enemies and nodes with                                 respect to view modes is that you're                                 really viewing the same node just from a                                 different angle perhaps or a different                                 way view millets are Drupal                                             people still working primarily in six                                 okay that's please join us                                 I understand that there are like                                 budgetary and organizational reasons why                                 you might still be primarily in six it                                 is so much better it is yeah better                                 Drupal                                                                 better than five like again so much                                 better but you know I really encourage                                 you to move whatever mountains you need                                 to get your get your your site or your                                 organization onto seven because it's a                                 happy place with puppies and rainbows so                                 view modes how do we use view modes the                                 sneaky thing is you're already using                                 view modes you just may you may not know                                 it you may know it so this is a managed                                 display page for a node these little                                 guys over here                                 these are view modes default and teaser                                 you are probably very familiar to                                 anybody who's done Drupal in the past                                 four or five years maybe even longer so                                 there are built in view modes in Drupal                                 default and teaser are active by default                                 this is this this                                 these view modes apply specifically to                                 notes there are different default things                                 for users and taxonomy terms this is                                 specific to notes you also have full                                 which is the named way of doing the full                                 page note load you have an RSS View mode                                 so if you want to display your note                                 differently to an RSS feed you can do                                 that search index if you want to expose                                 different information to drupal's                                 internal search indexing mechanism you                                 can use that and similarly search                                 results if you use Drupal Score search                                 results you can format them any way you                                 want and through the admin without                                 having to do any of this crazy jumping                                 through hoops so how you turn these on                                 you may never have clicked this open you                                 might have done at the bottom of the                                 manage display page is custom display                                 settings you pop that open and those are                                 view modes down there and if you want to                                 style things specifically for full                                 content or for RSS search index whatever                                 you just click this little checkboxes                                 and they'll be made available to you if                                 you don't do that then Drupal will fall                                 back on the default so that's where                                 those are available to you so let's look                                 at this full article thing so this is                                 the standard page display of an article                                 and let's just break down what it is                                 exactly we've got a title this is rocket                                 science                                 sorry we've got a subtitle this is a                                 little custom text field I added nothing                                 special we've got user                                 it's very standard looking stuff date                                 image body and this is the manage                                 display page for that view mode for that                                 full default view mode and so let's just                                 break down what we've got here we've got                                 the default fields that came with the                                 article type from Drupal we've got my                                 little subtitle custom text field it's                                 just a standard text field Drupal                                   Quarry field API we've got extra fields                                 we've got title and author and post date                                 which is the created date it's what I                                 ended up calling it what are these extra                                 fields extra fields are this not very                                 well known thing in Drupal                                             that                                 you implement them in code and what they                                 allow you to do is to expose non field                                 information in the admin to be ordered                                 with field information so you can take                                 things like title and date and author                                 that you probably actually care about                                 when you're creating your nodes and                                 allow them to be sort of dragged up and                                 down with the the table dragged and                                 exposed it's an alternative to doing                                 things through pre-processing which is                                 how this stuff is traditionally done and                                 traditionally being the key word there                                 and I think it's better personally                                 because you can just do it in the admin                                 do it all at once and not have to go                                 somewhere else in pre-process you will                                 leave here with an example of how to do                                 this I didn't want to dive into the code                                 for this because it would have taken                                 half the session and it's not worth it                                 but you will have a URL that has a                                 downloadable module that will show you                                 how to do this so just for the moment                                 just be with me that the title and the                                 author and the post date are rearranged                                 abaut in the admin at this point so we                                 got our node yay                                 so what why is that awesome what so                                 what's so special about that this is a                                 bunny                                 I love Drupal a lot and so I named my                                 buddy node tipple PHP she's really cute                                 you know she's kind of cool and one day                                 I got my bunny a friend and I named him                                 node article tipple PHP you can probably                                 see where this might be going pretty                                 soon I had more bunnies and even more                                 bunnies and they just kind of kept                                 coming and you know they're cute but but                                 don't be fooled these things will mess                                 you up bunnies or bunnies are scary so                                 has this this kind of thing has this                                 happened to anybody                                 any one node block node blog node client                                 node node node this is a small project                                 this is from something we did two or                                 three years ago before we knew better                                 there's like                                                        don't have to do that anymore you just                                 don't                                 so we generated this layout and it's not                                 a complicated layout but we told it how                                 we wanted things ordered without                                 touching the template                                 you can do all your know types this way                                 you can arrange them in the admin there                                 there isn't even a theme specific note                                 template here we're using core and you                                 can do that now you don't need to have                                 this stack of node specific templates                                 anymore I mean if you really want to                                 that's great                                 you kind of probably just want to have                                 one bunny you know there it's easier to                                 take care of one bunny it doesn't get                                 out of control especially if you try to                                 customize your bunny and you know do                                 things to it now imagine you know just                                 one bunny that's not so bad you got to                                 kind of hold him down and you know glue                                 the thing on him but you know if you had                                 all these different bunnies you know you                                 had to make a similar change to all of                                 them you're going into each one of those                                 templates and it's just not very                                 constructive and you know they're cute                                 don't get me wrong so too many templates                                 and by by inference too much PHP we're                                 taking care of those problems we're                                 starting to get somewhere so that's                                 great we've got our basic node but we do                                 want to be able to build all these other                                 types that Drupal doesn't automatically                                 give us we want our photo teaser and our                                 dated teaser and our subtitle teaser we                                 need to be able to configure those we                                 need this we need to actually have those                                 in the admin so that we can access them                                 and define what they actually display as                                 so we need to create custom view modes                                 how do I add more view modes I'm going                                 to show you three ways very quickly the                                 entity View mode module the display                                 suite and code code yes I'm gonna show                                 you some code an Indy View mode great                                 module very simple it does exactly one                                 thing it allows you to define new view                                 modes for your entities and it that's                                 all it does it's very lightweight the                                 one caveat with entity view mode is that                                 it keeps all of your field your sorry                                 your View mode definitions in one                                 variable so if you use features which I                                 imagine quite a number of you do you're                                 going to get all kinds of crazy                                 dependencies if you try to use this with                                 features if you're not using features                                 rock on it's very simple very light                                 go with it display sweet how many people                                 use display sweet some of you awesome                                 display sweets great it's extremely                                 powerful it's four modules many many                                 tools for controlling your display and                                 presentation it's really great stuff and                                 it has a better way of exporting your                                 view modes so if you do use features                                 with displays beat that those go                                 together extremely well you won't get                                 the dependency problems the thing with                                 this place we is it does a lot of things                                 and if you turn it on its gonna do I                                 mean it's not gonna transform your site                                 automatically but a lot of stuff will be                                 made available to you if you want that                                 that's great because it is a really                                 great module but if all you're wanting                                 to do is add a couple of you modes then                                 this probably isn't the way to go and                                 finally the way that I personally tend                                 to do it but you know your mileage may                                 vary defining view modes encode scary oh                                 no its code my coworker JR actually has                                 five of these in his living room he told                                 me this is a goblin shark beautiful                                 beautiful animal and we've and we've                                 scared the bunny sad so but do you know                                 that it's just it's just a little bit of                                 code it's not a big deal we're just                                 gonna do some code so this is how much                                 code you have to do it's really not bad                                 so what you're going to be doing if you                                 define this in code is implementing hook                                 entity info alter and specifically                                 you're altering the entity info for the                                 node and you're adding view modes and                                 you just create a machine name photo                                 teaser it can be anything it wants                                 provided it's a normal machine name you                                 give it a label and custom settings                                 equals true means that it will be on by                                 default so that that little list of                                 check boxes that we had you don't even                                 need to bother doing that it'll just be                                 on that's it six lines of code it's                                 really easy you just throw that into                                 module somewhere that's fine and once we                                 do that we have our view modes and we                                 can sort of get up and running so let's                                 take a look at this one down here again                                 I called this subtitle teaser and let's                                 just break it down again and look                                 quickly at what it does it's got an                                 image notice that the image is if you're                                 thinking sort of in                                 marca it's to the left its above the                                 title technically we've got our title                                 I've got our subtitle display and we've                                 got a trimmed version of the body and                                 also just you know                                 notice that this doesn't wrap not a big                                 deal this is you know not rocket science                                 but it doesn't wrap and I'll show why                                 that's actually relevant so this is the                                 managed display page for subtitle teaser                                 notice that we've selected that we are                                 in fact working on our new View mode                                 that we've defined notice we put the                                 image at the top you can start doing                                 this once we implement the extra fields                                 there's a couple little tricks I                                 explained in the code that I'm gonna                                 give you you can start putting stuff                                 above the title which is I we found to                                 be a really common design case that you                                 know people want to put an image above                                 the title or you know the date perhaps                                 so let me get this guy filled group how                                 many of you use filled group yeah Gil                                 groups great filled group used to be                                 part of CCK back in six it's its own                                 country bundle now it allows you to                                 create field sets divs other containers                                 around groups of field output and                                 incidentally you can also use it on the                                 app inside and that's super useful if                                 you have a complex node type with many                                 fields you might want to group those                                 together to make it easier on your                                 clients because otherwise they're just                                 looking at fields soup so we've got her                                 I just made a div it's very simple and                                 it wraps up those three things so it                                 wraps the title the subtitle and the                                 body and there we go that's it                                 incidentally all these settings that we                                 are creating you're probably gonna want                                 to export these at some time how many of                                 you use features you're done sorry I                                 should have kept the slides up with me                                 you're done if you use features to                                 export your content types this is all                                 already happening you're you're all the                                 different view modes for your content                                 types are being output and they'll just                                 come back in so you don't need to even                                 think about it really so so we've got                                 this yay what might we do with this one                                 idea is a node reference I'm making you                                 guys raise your hand I'm sorry it's what                                 it's good it's exercise how many you use                                 node reference it's like everybody                                 practically right like it's a super                                 handy module so this is a example user                                 profile page and it's pretty                                 straightforward you know that standard                                 user profile stuff                                 I got to go bowling in the white house                                 that was a really cool perk for working                                 on do we that was neat I added a bio                                 field nothing special and I added a                                 featured content field and I actually I                                 made this a node reference thinking well                                 partly just to for this use case for                                 explaining                                 thinking that an author might want to                                 instead of having their content listed                                 automatically to choose to highlight I                                 really like and I wrote this article and                                 so this particular thing is a node                                 reference and this is our manage display                                 notice that the view there our view                                 modes for user as well as nodes they're                                 different and we're just going to work                                 with the default case we're not going to                                 do anything crazy with the view modes in                                 this case and I really just want to look                                 at the the actual node reference field                                 and specifically what you might choose                                 you can display node references in a lot                                 of ways you can choose rendered node and                                 then in the settings you just pick                                 subtitle teaser when you save and there                                 you are                                 it's dropped in you don't have to                                 pre-process you don't have to do any                                 hoops or anything it just drops right in                                 so why is that awesome you still only                                 have one bunny no templates were written                                 in the making of that profile no                                 pre-process code was written when we did                                 that everything your tool said I like to                                 think of my template PHP kind of as my                                 tools and I tried to keep it kind of to                                 a minimum and keep it in good working                                 order and you're keeping things kind of                                 simple which is good so too many                                 templates too much PHP we're still doing                                 good you don't have to do those things                                 anymore I mean again you might want to                                 but you don't have to just probably                                 talked about views it's in Colorado                                 beautiful by the way it's like crazy                                 beautiful I've never I've only been here                                 once and it's it's ridiculous anyway                                 so we really should talk about views and                                 why you are maybe doing too much view                                 steaming take a look at these you can                                 think of these as blocks the thing on                                 the left is a page looking at this how                                 many of you would say views for building                                 things like this perhaps like a related                                 content list block perhaps like a list                                 of recent features or something like                                 that yeah so views is really well-suited                                 to selecting those nodes it's really                                 good at that views uses a visual query                                 editor it's basically a way for you to                                 construct complex queries of your                                 content without actually having to dig                                 into the sequel you might want to                                 reconsider why might you want to                                 reconsider using views to design and                                 deem your output this is separate from                                 the selection process of the nodes so                                 we're just talking about the theming for                                 a moment this is what happens this is                                 what happens if you use views to theme                                 your output has this ever happened to                                 you anybody this again this wasn't a                                 very big project this project I that's                                 kind of too small to read even you know                                 and like what's one of them I guess I                                 can sort of look at it like views - view                                 - unformatted - - homepage - banner - -                                 block - one tipple dot PHP that's easy                                 right you know you're never gonna                                 you're never gonna mess that up you're                                 never going to not know where to find                                 your theming right yeah so the other                                 thing about you know using views to do                                 your actual display your theming is that                                 views displays aren't really portable I                                 mean you can export them but if you want                                 to use a display that you've created and                                 move it from one view to another you're                                 kind of Sol you know you and even if you                                 sometimes once you've split if you want                                 to make a similar change in two of your                                 view your views displays and they've                                 they've diverged they're specific to                                 that display you have to go into each                                 one it's it's kind of a pain in the butt                                 so this is maybe how many use the fields                                 output in views how many use mostly use                                 the fields yeah I mean we do we did                                 historically we needed to you know so                                 you have your fields and you go through                                 that long long list of all the fields in                                 your entire system and you know you pick                                 out the five that you want and you                                 hopefully got the right ones and not                                 like some weird variant that you don't                                 really understand what it is but it's                                 there and you know and then you fill in                                 all this stuff and it's just you know                                 it's easy right views it's like it's                                 it's easy right you don't have to do                                 that anymore okay                                 again if you want to if you if that if                                 that's your thing if it spins your boat                                 I like rock on but you can use view                                 modes to output your views results and I                                 will show you how we've got the little                                 format and field section and what we're                                 going to do is click where it says well                                 it already says content maybe previously                                 it would have said fields if that's how                                 you're used to working and you click on                                 that and you select content and not                                 fields it's good and then you select the                                 options and you pull down the view mode                                 that you've already created and defined                                 and done the CSS for and you select it                                 and then you get this beautiful sentence                                 the most beautiful sentence I've ever                                 seen which is the selected style or row                                 format does not utilize fields it's it's                                 poetry it's so good and you're done you                                 know like this is this views page that I                                 mean I can't remember the criteria I                                 came up for deciding which these things                                 were the important thing is this is a                                 page of views maybe it's you know recent                                 hot features on your site this is the                                 subtitle teaser we already defined this                                 we didn't have to do anything when once                                 you define it you can use it over and                                 over and over again this makes using                                 views a lot faster and a lot less                                 painful it's good it's a really good                                 thing so too many templates too much PHP                                 too much views formatting we knocked                                 them all off high five good time good                                 dog                                 so other uses that you may come up with                                 for view modes like I said search                                 results as a View mode so                                 if you are using Drupal core search                                 which not as many of us do these days                                 but if you are it's it's it's very                                 capable and you can output your nodes in                                 a specific way by activating search                                 results and it can be it can be                                 different per node you could have a                                 photo gallery and that puts out two or                                 three of the photos in your search                                 results you could have a small video for                                 a video note however you want to do it                                 sir again search index is also a View                                 mode so you might want to expose more                                 information to the search index than you                                 actually display to the user to make a                                 broader range of search results return                                 an item and this allows you to do this                                 and also it can be messy because the                                 search index doesn't care you know the                                 search index is just about finding                                 content custom blocks and functions                                 let's take this you know a little bit                                 contrived example that at the end of an                                 article we want a related content block                                 say and you know this is our block and                                 we don't as femurs as site builders we                                 don't necessarily even care about the                                 logic we're gonna give that to our                                 developer she's gonna come up with you                                 know the whatever set of criteria to                                 decide that this node is related to the                                 other node that's not our concern and                                 conversely it's not her concern how it                                 gets output all we have to do is tell                                 her I'll put this node with subtitle                                 teaser and word on you didn't have to                                 theme that you didn't have to do                                 anything you provided that feedback view                                 mode already exists it just outputs                                 again and that's that's so much better                                 than having two themed things similarly                                 over and over and over again this is a                                 more actual real real world example this                                 is from energy gov it's a news blog                                 aggregation page                                 I shouldn't have highlighted the nodes                                 on the right the contributors although                                 yay secretary - that's awesome                                 but the first two columns those are all                                 the same node type and we're actually                                 this isn't views we're using beam which                                 I'll mention again briefly a little bit                                 later beam is basically a way to easily                                 build lots of custom blocks that might                                 have queries in them and so but again                                 these are all the same know                                 type they're just displaying differently                                 you know we've got this one view mode                                 that has this large image and the title                                 and the date the other ones have the                                 date above and a small little teaser the                                 ones down below have no teaser those are                                 all different view modes and again it's                                 all articles it's all the same content                                 what if you change the view mode what if                                 you know your editorial team or your                                 business team or whoever come and say we                                 really need to have a date in all these                                 places and you know okay so we drop in a                                 date in this view mode definition and                                 boom there it is boom there it is boom                                 it all happens at once you don't have to                                 go into each of these different places                                 and change this template and change that                                 view and have all these different                                 mechanisms for doing those changes you                                 change it once it's good hey you know                                 gig happy of course there's always                                 gotchas there's always problems you know                                 you're not getting a free lunch here you                                 never do so design issues consistent                                 design is pretty key to using view modes                                 effectively and what I mean by that is                                 grid based design for one but also                                 design that makes use of repeating                                 elements so these are I apologize for                                 the sort of low JPEG quality of these                                 things these are from energy gov and                                 simple you know these are blocks with                                 little thumbnails and a title this is a                                 sort of different set up but it's still                                 the same sized thumbnail and a little                                 title underneath it that's a CSS problem                                 we don't need to make another template                                 for that this is again a similar thing                                 thumbnail title right next to it so the                                 more that you can get reusable elements                                 like that into the design or you can                                 encourage your designer to do that the                                 better that said there are some                                 inconsistencies here you notice there's                                 a couple maybe there taxonomy terms or                                 it's the the user associated with that                                 article those are inconsistency                                 and those are gonna bite you in the butt                                 so if you can encourage your designer to                                 let go of those or your business people                                 to let go of some of those it will save                                 them time it will save you time it will                                 save everybody money so when you're                                 reviewing a design and thinking of how                                 to build it looking for inconsistencies                                 like that is gonna help you a lot and                                 pushing back if that's possible in the                                 way that you work on those things and                                 saying maybe you want to do this a                                 little differently so you do need to                                 watch out for that honestly your                                 designers should be doing this already                                 if your designers not doing Co I'm sorry                                 doing grid design if they're not using                                 these sort of repeatable elements then                                 you might want to educate them or                                 something you might want to do something                                 views issues specific to views this                                 doesn't work with tables if you think                                 about it tables are inherently a                                 collection of fields and that's kind of                                 what you want from a table this also                                 won't work if you're trying to output                                 multiple entities are rather fields from                                 multiple entities at once remember the                                 view mode is you're picking a whole and                                 like a whole node say and displaying it                                 so pulling things from multiple places                                 doesn't really work you could maybe try                                 to re are connect your things with some                                 you know judicious node reference or                                 user reference information but if you're                                 really pulling from many different                                 entities using a lot of relationships                                 you're probably still going to have to                                 go with fields theming issues                                 consistency is good and consistency is                                 also kind of boring sometimes                                 so you might have to give a bit in order                                 to have a design that the designers                                 happy with you might you might have to                                 give some I mean you're not gonna be                                 able to make everything read you know                                 regimented into tiny little boxes                                 necessarily and you might not want to do                                 that either also I keep saying this you                                 don't have to do that anymore but                                 sometimes you do you know sometimes                                 you're gonna have to pre-process                                 something sometimes you might actually                                 need a separate template you might you                                 know and there's not going to be isn't a                                 magic bullet                                 sometimes you gotta override you know                                 I'll let you on a dirty secret I did                                 some pre-processing in my                                 like mock-up little site there's some                                 pre-processing in there a little bit                                 there's no special templates but there                                 is pre process but the thing is that the                                 way that we were given temp the way that                                 theming was presented to us in five and                                 six and what we actually needed to do                                 forced us to do all these other things                                 it forced us to use pre process it                                 forced us to use different templates for                                 every single node type and in some cases                                 to use views and we had no other options                                 and so it became the way that we theme                                 and it still it can be the way that you                                 theme it just doesn't have to be the                                 default way that you theme necessarily                                 you might be more comfortable theming                                 that way and you know full respect                                 that's great                                 but you you don't have to do this by                                 default anymore you don't have to just                                 assume oh yeah I've got a node reference                                 I'm gonna pre processes everything and                                 I'm going to have                                                      my node types you don't have to do that                                 necessarily                                 so in summary view modes they will help                                 you prevent an explosion of tipples they                                 will make theming views less painful                                 they will get you out of writing PHP or                                 at least as much PHP or at least less                                 interesting PHP we hope and really                                 ultimately they create reusable style                                 for your entities that you can use over                                 and over again they basically help you                                 theme faster and I think that's                                 something we all agree is a good thing                                 so your loved ones miss you your                                 children they miss you your puppy misses                                 you your panda your panda misses you so                                 stop wasting your life doing things that                                 you don't necessarily need to do unless                                 you enjoy doing that in which case rock                                 on but otherwise please use view modes                                 these are some resources these are just                                 the three modules that I talked about in                                 here you don't need to write this down                                 what you do baby want to write down or                                 just bookmark right now is bitly dot our                                 sorry bitly slash view - modes and that                                 will take you to a little site on its on                                 treehouse agency comm right now I'm sure                                 it will move to phase                                               always point you in the right direction                                 and that is explanation of the resources                                 some additional material and in                                 particular a detailed explanation of                                 that extra fields thing that I talked                                 about at the beginning which was it's                                 too detailed to go into an accession of                                 this length but there is an explanation

love                                 the bunny I'm not a Photoshop guy but I                                 really had fun making that if you do                                 have questions please come to the mic at                                 the center of the room so that the                                 people on the video can hear you good                                 how are you you're not calm you're a                                 natural                                 I I like I like some rage comics I do I                                 do                                 yeah can you can you lift the mic up or                                 speak into it we have a lot of                                 conditional logic wondering do you have                                  any suggestions about how to do                                  something conditional well you could                                  redo the site that's not the right                                  answer that you want though the question                                  was a lot there's a lot of conditional                                  logic and their theme and many many                                  tipples and how might we go about                                  reducing that it does work better if you                                  start from the beginning with this in                                  mind which is not a great answer                                  actually but I would start maybe looking                                  at similar cases where you might be able                                  to reduce things down maybe think that                                  people get really caught in the way that                                  their content is structured currently                                  and sometimes it's hard for them to see                                  that they could maybe structure at a                                  different way but so maybe looking                                  looking at some of these many tipples                                  and seeing which of them actually could                                  be conflated to produce a number of                                  things that you're working with that's                                  that's what I would probably suggest but                                  like I said it really it does work                                  better if the design and the information                                  architecture has it in mind from the                                  beginning to be consistent does that                                  answer something okay thank you                                  so I was wondering in the view modes in                                  your templates you can do like if teaser                                  then do this if you know not their full                                  page then do this with the added view                                  modes could you do if photo teaser in                                  your templates you could do that yes                                  yeah the preprocessor it's one of the                                  variables in your pre process functions                                  so there are those are available to you                                  I I do do that in pre process you could                                  put that logic in your template as well                                  really really recommend that you put                                  that logic in the template PHP itself in                                  a pre process function but it is an                                  available variable for you yes yeah yeah                                  it's definitely available to you thank                                  you how did you manage to to have the                                  fields author and block blog post date                                  available on the manage fields display a                                  UI that's that's that extra fields thing                                  that I was talking about oh I'm sorry                                  other question was how do we make the                                  title and the author in the post date                                  available in the fields UI and that's                                  the extra fields thing that I talked                                  about at the beginning again it's it's a                                  it's a fields hook hook feel field extra                                  fields and if you go to the URL that I                                  showed there's a long explanation of how                                  to make that happen for you and how to                                  both make those available to the manage                                  display admin UI and how to output those                                  into your content okay you could also                                  use display sweet yes                                  and again display sweets great this is                                  just a different way of showing it yes I                                  can show the URL again absolutely that                                  was the question will also tweet this so                                  I'm sure Mike will my company and

                   one of the questions earlier was if                                  you're in a position where you have a                                  lot of tea pls how can you leverage this                                  on an existing site and I just want to                                  also add a tip to the answer that Tim                                  had I'm I work with Tim by the way there                                  is a way to easily switch a theme with                                  my suggestion to add to his answer                                  that take a lot of the CSS and stuff                                  that you have and just start a new theme                                  and then you can use a camera with the                                  hook is but it's like hook build                                  something I'll give it to you later and                                  you could just switch the theme and as                                  you are rebuilding the new theme then                                  use the boom view modes in that case and                                  then once you've gone through your                                  entire site for your various content                                  types you can switch based on concept                                  what-have-you                                  once you've SWAT them all out and using                                  the simpler view modes and simpler                                  templates then you can get rid of the                                  old theme and you've slowly transition                                  to the new view modes instead of having                                  to destroy what you already have and you                                  can keep your production site going by                                  just you know starting with the same CSS                                  the same JavaScript you may have your                                  old theme but use the base set of                                  templates and then just create a quick                                  module to use and I apologize for what I                                  came in with the hook is but it's hook                                  underscore build underscore something                                  else and just switch it by the content                                  type and then as you're putting the view                                  modes in each content type you say okay                                  I'm going to use the new theme for this                                  one because I'm using vemos for that and                                  then once you get them all switched over                                  you can get rid of the old tales I'm                                  gonna ask you to write that up as a                                  posed Frederick actually thank you                                  that's Frederick Mitchell he works for a                                  phase two also do you have a question                                  that's the Delta Delta module okay okay                                  okay so just just to repeat that on the                                  suggestion is one other way of doing                                  that would be to use the Delta module                                  along with perhaps the Omega theme or                                  another theme to do switching based on                                  context using the contacts module I'm                                  assuming Delta module and context to do                                  theme switching so that you could have                                  some of your site in one theme and other                                  parts of your site in another theme                                  that's a good suggestion thank you okay                                  it gives you a second set of settings                                  okay if people do have things to say I                                  really welcome it but I would love if                                  you'd come to the microphone so that                                  everybody can hear you so anybody else                                  have questions yeah please when do you                                  or do you ever decide that's a very                                  personal decision no it's well of course                                  you're the cases I talked about like if                                  you have a table view you're gonna have                                  to use fields if you have multiple                                  entities being displayed at once you                                  also if it's a really special display                                  case that doesn't match anything else                                  you have in your site that might be a                                  reason to go with fields the the real                                  win of view modes is having these                                  repeatable displays and so if someone's                                  really married to this very specific                                  layout that you don't have in use                                  anywhere you might not want to do that                                  I've just remembered I'll tweet this                                  also um if you wouldn't mind rating me                                  they want to rate me or they want me to                                  tell you to rate me so if you will feel                                  obliged but yeah um so if you if you had                                  a really specific use case then I would                                  say maybe stick with stick with fields                                  if you remember the view modes being                                  displayed at the top of the manage                                  display page we've done sites where we                                  end up having like                                              that that's not good either that's it's                                  it's not good to have too many of those                                  things we end up actually rather than                                  using seven for the admin theme we use                                  Rubik because it's pretty much                                  specifically because it has a different                                  mechanism for dealing with that so you                                  don't want to have too many of you moons                                  either that can be the same kind of you                                  know suck that you get out of having                                  fifteen or twenty templates so you kind                                  of want to avoid that as well                                  yes view modes are tied to content types                                  yes they are is there a way to share                                  between the so actually there they're                                  not strictly tied to content types                                  they're tied to nodes so well let me                                  take a step back that's a good that's a                                  really good question the names so say I                                  have my photo teaser that View mode is                                  tied to the node entity the sort of                                  abstract node entity so when you create                                  that it's available to all your content                                  types                                  that said you do have to go into like                                  your article and your photo gallery and                                  define photo teaser for that that's                                  actually a good thing because it allows                                  you to have different node types with                                  the same view mode so for example your                                  views don't need to worry about content                                  type anymore you can just say I want a                                  bunch of stuff with a given taxonomy                                  term you don't have to worry about the                                  field output anymore you're just                                  displaying so like you could have things                                  that are tagged you know awesome puppy I                                  wish I had a better thing than that but                                  so all your nodes tagged awesome puppy                                  that are in a like say the search                                  results you can so the video could have                                  like a thumbnail of the video and the                                  photo gallery could have like two or                                  three thumbnails and the article could                                  have a entirely different display but                                  because those displays are all                                  functionally being used together you can                                  do it that way does that make sense okay                                  sorry real quickly the hook is hooked                                  custom theme hook custom theme Thank You                                  Frederick that's the hook he was talking                                  about earlier you're still going to                                  write a post about that I hope yeah                                  gonna make you work anybody else have                                  any questions well I
