Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: THE ACLU & DRUPAL
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	This presentation will focus on how the national ACLU has uses Drupal for the main ACLU.org site, and how it's been a benefit to our organization. In summary: * Our initial CMS selection process, focusing on: ** Constraints in our old system ** Organizational drivers (multiple editors, content showing up across multiple channels) ** Privacy concerns * Why we like Drupal: ** Flexibility (lots of small and large changes since we've launched, including reconfiguration and new content types-- mostly that we have the flexibility to keep growing/changing within ** Drupal, rather than needing to keep upgrading to new systems; integration of advocacy actions site-wide; Springboard) ** Open-source (we can customize to suit our specific needs, like project/issue hierarchy -- and we can do some edits in-house, which would never be an option in proprietary systems) ** Community support and contributions (we can coordinate with other non-profits, like EFF, on what we've done and what works for them; our privacy changes and others are back in the community) * Future plans: ** Blog redesign ** Drupal 7 upgrade ** More robust action/donation integration site-wide.

Questions answered by this session:

	                              hi everyone ah thank you for coming to                               this session we're gonna be talking                               about the ACLU website and how we use                               Drupal for those of you who are at the                               nonprofit session yesterday we talked a                               lot about wanting more case studies on                               the web and being able to see what other                               nonprofit websites have done so here's a                               case study about the ACLU so I'm Jenny                                corpsman I work at the atl you as the                                associate director of IT for Internet                                technology which basically means that I                                manage all of the technical backend                                stuff of our website and all of our                                online interactivity I am Marco carboni                                I am the technical lead album addict we                                are a triple shop that specializes in                                nonprofit organizations unions and other                                progressive causes and I worked on the                                initial planning and build of the AC do                                excite about three years ago yeah we've                                worked with Marco and the team at a                                dramatic pretty much consistently since                                we first conceived of our redesign and                                an ongoing support and development                                capacity over the past several years so                                we're going to be talking today about                                why we went into a new CMS and why we                                chose Drupal what we've done with Drupal                                and what we're going to be doing in the                                future so feel free at any time to                                interrupt ask questions whatever else                                like that and we can do questions at the                                end as well so why we needed a new CMS                                basically there was a one of the major                                drivers was there was a planned redesign                                of the site you can see here what our                                old site looked like before the redesign                                what you don't get a good sense of for                                that is the fact that this was really                                really narrow it was designed with old                                computers in mind without a lot of                                pixels so it's a very narrow column                                which didn't give us a lot of space to                                do things on the actual site we also had                                exceptionally little flexibility in the                                templates given the content management                                system that we are using we really                                couldn't ever edit anything on our own                                we just had to stick with exactly this                                layout one of the major problems that we                                ran into is if we ever wanted to do some                                kind of splash page or highlight                                something in a much more focused manner                                we had a lot of difficulty doing so for                                example we had a big                                pain several years ago called the John                                Adams project which discussed our                                willingness to provide legal counsel for                                inmates in Guantanamo when we first                                announced this project which got a lot                                of press and we want to make sure folks                                were aware of what we're doing and why                                we wanted to basically take over the                                entire home page with a John Adams                                splash page that wasn't possible in our                                old content management system we had to                                do this really sketchy hack we're                                basically our old content management                                system was a hosted content management                                system where you would enter the content                                like on a on a web page and then it                                would actually compile it generate HTML                                and push the HTML to our web servers so                                for the John Adams hack what we did was                                we said to everybody in the organization                                stop publishing content don't push                                anything new live we're going to                                actually go into the servers and                                manually overwrite the HTML files with                                this John Adams splash page which worked                                but kept disappearing if somebody                                forgotten publish new comp done so we're                                in a position where we really couldn't                                do a lot of the things that we wanted to                                do on our website we also suffered from                                extremely slow publishing because of the                                structure that I just described                                basically everything in the site had to                                be published from from our the hosted                                solution which was the content                                management system and then copied into                                our web servers and it would not only do                                it once per page would do it for every                                page reference so if you entered one                                paint if you updated one page that                                happened to be used throughout the site                                it would regenerate thousands of pages                                which meant if you were like adding a                                 menu item or changing the terminology on                                 a menu it could mean that it would take                                 thousands of page Publishing's for                                 things to actually go live which could                                 take hours at a time and given the fact                                 that we're organization that is very                                 responsive to breaking news we often                                 want to publicize an upcoming vote in                                 Congress or something like that or let                                 folks know about a Supreme Court                                 decision that was just                                 it's definitely not ideal for us to                                 sometimes face a several hour lag                                 between when we get the news and want to                                 put it on our site and when it could                                 actually go live all of this ties into                                 the fact that was a proprietary closed                                 system even though we had some technical                                 expertise in-house we couldn't actually                                 do anything with it we couldn't edit any                                 of the architecture ourselves we                                 couldn't change the templates ourselves                                 we'd very little flexibility and very                                 few options on what we could do and then                                 one of the more minor concerns but over                                 time increasingly concerning is that the                                 URLs sucked look at them they're just                                 not helpful for anyone to know what page                                 they're looking at what it's talking                                 about or to help the Google find us and                                 everybody wants to Google to find them                                 we also had we started undertaking this                                 redesign and you know the late two                                 thousand mid to late                                                     lot of other organizations we were                                 having an increasing growth in both the                                 technical savvy within our organization                                 and the amount of content being created                                 for specifically for the web so we had                                 more and more editors who knew more                                 about the web wanted to be able to do                                 more things and we're pushing us to do                                 more things as well as more content                                 being created throughout the web for the                                 web specifically so instead of just                                 press releases which as an organization                                 we have historically loved to do we also                                 did a lot more content that was supposed                                 to be more dynamic and specifically for                                 the Internet one of the major problems                                 with this though is because the old                                 system did not have a lot of built-in                                 dynamic behavior or flexibility we                                 actually had to manually update lengths                                 so for example if we wanted to put up a                                 piece of content that was related to the                                 women's rights project we would need to                                 go into the women's rights project page                                 and add a link there and then find all                                 the other places where we thought that                                 might be an interesting reference and                                 manually add a link there so ended up                                 being a huge process to be able to get a                                 site was well linked and well-integrated                                 it's totally manual more or less and                                 finally where the ACLU we care a lot                                 about privacy and security we take                                 constituent privacy very seriously and                                 we have a lot of unusual requirements                                 around that for example we don't use                                 permanent                                 jeez um I think we and the eff and the                                 federal government are pretty much it                                 who don't do that which means out of the                                 box most systems don't support that I                                 spent a lot of my life talking to                                 vendors and saying no really we honestly                                 can't use permanent cookies and being                                 able to have direct control over our                                 privacy and security and be able to make                                 that fit to our system based on our                                 needs was really important to us so                                 given all this Drupal obviously came up                                 as a promising alternative to us beyond                                 being able to remedy some of the                                 concerns that I just raised we also had                                 existing technical knowledge in house we                                 have web developers who are here                                 allocation Miriam if you want to ask                                 them questions and they had expertise                                 already in the lamp stack now we didn't                                 have our Drupal expertise in-house but                                 with apache and PHP knowledge it's a                                 pretty easy transition into drupal we                                 also really really like the ability to                                 have flexible modules and be able to do                                 customizations we change our minds a lot                                 like a lot of other organizations and we                                 like and we want the ability to make                                 things work the way we want them to work                                 and being able to actually get in there                                 and do customizations was super                                 appealing to us and then we also really                                 like the idea of both being able to                                 evolve the system with the community and                                 participate back in the community and to                                 go back to the cookies example I                                 mentioned earlier we created a                                 workaround for cookies which has now                                 been actually wrapped into the Drupal                                   core another thing that appealed to us                                 was the ability to do multiple themes                                 and different look and feels within one                                 overall system you can see here that's                                 what our main website looks like now and                                 that's what our blog had looked like we                                 wanted to be able to maintain a distinct                                 look and feel for the blog because it                                 was a redesign that we had done not long                                 before we launched the before we                                 launched the overall site redesign and                                 we wanted to make the blog have a                                 distinct appearance but still have                                 content integrated throughout the site                                 and Drupal did that really naturally                                 templates and finally as a non-profit                                 cost was super appealing I know Drupal                                 as free as in puppies as a post actually                                 free but no matter what system we're                                 using we're going to have to have                                 maintenance and support from some                                 vendors somewhere drupal because it did                                 not have licensing fees it made that                                 substantially cheaper frost on undertake                                 and not only does that save us and our                                 constituents money and allow us to spend                                 more money on things like you know                                 fighting cases at the Supreme Court it                                 also gives us more flexibility to do                                 more interesting things with the money                                 that we're spending so what have we done                                 since we've been on Drupal the very                                 first thing we did was implement a total                                 site redesign which if you remember what                                 the previous site looks like this is                                 quite different one of the great things                                 about it from our perspective is its a                                 mix of manually curated content which is                                 highlighted and that's the marquee that                                 you see where it says the need is great                                 that's all stuff that our editors can                                 specifically choose to highlight add                                 image add additional links to go to the                                 content and then the block below the                                 ACLU updates block is a totally dynamic                                 blog so anytime you use our ads content                                 to the site as long as they check a                                 checkbox saying that it's okay for the                                 homepage it'll show up there in reverse                                 chronological order and you'll also see                                 that we have different ways to filter                                 that information as well based on the                                 type of content you might be interested                                 in so if you want to see the most recent                                 multimedia there's a tab to enable you                                 to do that we also have site-wide                                 features so going down the right rail we                                 have the standard you know join now give                                 us money take action etc we also have a                                 persistent site-wide block to allow                                 folks to take action on a specific issue                                 that we want to highlight for we often                                 have advocacy actions that we really                                 want to get folks participating in and                                 this give us a great opportunity to do                                 that and then we also have the ability                                 to give folks the option to find their                                 local ACLU affiliate as you might know I                                 represent the national organization but                                 there are                                                              country and they work on state specific                                 issues so we want to make it easy for                                 folks to find the affiliate that they                                 might need to reach out to                                 I'm gonna pass over to Marco to talk                                 about some of the other stuff we've done                                 thanks Jenny um I'm going to talk about                                 a couple other things we did in the                                 initial build so of course one of the                                 biggest challenges of moving to any                                 platform is content migration and so in                                 this case we had about                                                items that were mostly on the                                 proprietary CMS that the ACA was on                                 before we got involved and then there                                 was also some content in the separate                                 WordPress installation that they used                                 for their blog so for this build we                                 created a custom migration script to                                 bring in                                                                various static assets like files images                                 media these days if I was doing this                                 today we would use the version                                          migrate module which makes this a lot                                 easier gives you things the ability to                                 do things like do a migration and then                                 roll back much more easy to organize                                 your code but back then that was not                                 available so we did it customer we also                                 had a separate WordPress migration                                 script that we there was there's several                                 modules out there actually that that                                 integrate with WordPress help you                                 migrate the content in there's also one                                 nowadays that integrates with the                                 migrate module and of course jenny was                                 showing you the ugly legacy urls earlier                                 fortunately they had a unique ID in them                                 so we were able to write apache rewrite                                 so that you know any year well that was                                 stored in google would redirect to the                                 new URL on the site so when we were                                 doing the initial planning we had to                                 come up with a architecture that matched                                 the complex organizational structure of                                 the ACLU so we came up with a                                 hierarchical system of campaigns                                 projects and issues that matched how                                 certain processes happen                                 at a co you it's never a perfect fit and                                 there were definitely some challenges                                 but they have separate projects at the                                 ACU such as women's rights racial                                 justice national security so we use that                                 model to organize content and then on                                 the site we can display content thats                                 related to those those those projects                                 and issues now it's not it wasn't just a                                 simple like taxonomy situation because                                 there's a lot of metadata associated                                 with those each project has an image                                 description and a bunch of other                                 information so we had a source store                                 that and knows this is Drupal                                         talking about so we didn't have the                                 ability like we would today to have an                                 entity system where we could add fields                                 to terms so we do that on a note per                                 node content type basis so here in this                                 example we're looking at the women's                                 rights project page and then below that                                 those related content that's being                                 pulled based on cases and news items and                                 multimedia items that are also with the                                 women's rights project and then we had                                 to come up with a complex permission                                 structure that allowed the ACLU to                                 create content manage content in these                                 individual projects so this is a bit of                                 a challenge because there's multiple                                 sort of node permissions settings that                                 we needed to have from multiple modules                                 and Drupal even to this day kind of                                 makes that a bit of a challenge so we                                 needed to have multiple level of                                 permissions for super users and admins                                 and publishers and writers but we also                                 needed to be able to restrict those                                 permissions by section so for example                                 the LGBT project you have certain                                 employees staff members who could only                                 publish content in that project and then                                 we also have the ability for certain                                 staff members to be writers so they                                 could you know right drafts and then                                 publisher to be able to approve those                                 drafts so the obvious solution to that                                 in Drupal                                                           module which lets you set up revision                                 States and there's the workflow access                                 module that lets you create permissions                                 based on                                 can move a piece of content from a draft                                 to a revision to needs review to                                 published but we also needed another                                 node access module that lets you manage                                 permissions sort of on the the project                                 issue campaign hierarchy so there's a                                 module out there called taxonomy access                                 that does this we had to build a custom                                 version because we were not using terms                                 directly called it was an e cou                                 project-based module the challenge is                                 that Drupal doesn't make it easy to have                                 multiple note access modules what it                                 does is if one of the modules gives                                 grants permission to a piece of content                                 then it doesn't it doesn't care what the                                 other module that what the other access                                 module says so in this case if someone                                 was given the access to the LGBT rights                                 project it didn't matter whether or not                                 there were a writer publisher they could                                 just do it anything they wanted so we                                 had to make sure that those those are                                 not an or condition it's an ant                                 condition you need both missions so with                                 Drupal                                                                  grants that does just that and it's kind                                 of ugly and how it does it has to sort                                 of clobber some fundamental Drupal                                 access code in order to do it these days                                 in Drupal                                                              that let modules alter that process so                                 these days we would use something like                                 the workbench moderation and workbench                                 access modules that would give us                                 exactly what we need without clobber a                                 mini core menu items so in addition we                                 wanted to be able to pull content from                                 external sources so ACLU uses or has                                 been using convio for a lot of their                                 external actions and and activism tools                                 so we created a couple feeds or they cou                                 created a couple feeds that generate                                 actions categorized by the projects and                                 issues and then we use the feeds module                                 to pull those in as actions that can                                 appear on the site so we pull them in as                                 Drupal content but then when the user                                 clicks on the action they get sent to an                                 external convio action                                 age and of course like any good site we                                 had a media center the media center has                                 various categories as videos which we                                 use YouTube and other providers                                 slideshows with Flickr podcasts that are                                 custom audio and then interactive media                                 which are like custom gh JavaScript                                 applications Erin wind-borne he's one of                                 the mint a nurs of the media module is a                                 tab ematic so he was heavily involved in                                 crafting a very state-of-the-art media                                 center making the process for editors to                                 add media very easy and I'll get to that                                 in a second more on that so over time of                                 course the ACLU wood has addition                                 additional architectural needs and you                                 know Drupal makes it really easy to add                                 new content types and to integrate that                                 with the architecture we already have so                                 for example recently they've added the                                 concept of features so we were you know                                 able to create a new content type for                                 that create a new ACLU features page and                                 then make it really easy to pull related                                 content based on those features so                                 during the process of the initial build                                 and also in the years since when we've                                 been adding new features we've made                                 several community contributions back to                                 the triple community based on the work                                 that we did for ACLU org so Jenny                                 touched upon earlier on the privacy                                 customizations so one of you know                                 YouTube for example when you play embed                                 a YouTube video directly it adds a                                 cookie so this is a problem and actually                                 the eff Electronic Frontier Foundation                                 who's doing a talk later today they came                                 up with a solution to kind of show a                                 thumbnail image of the YouTube and then                                 you when you clicked on it it actually                                 could warn the user if you click on this                                 image you're going to get cookies you                                 know you've been warned now when they                                 clicked on it it would embed the video                                 and they hit the cookies since then                                 we've able to do even better than that                                 one of our contributions was to                                 integrate JW player with the                                 meteor module which was the embedded                                 media field module in Drupal                                           the JW player can play youtube videos                                 without cookies also we needed to be                                 able to tell Drupal not to set permanent                                 cookies now this was not doable in                                 Drupal                                                                  adds several cookies including session                                 cookies but you have anonymous users                                 they have a session cookie so we had to                                 replace the session modules to avoid                                 that permanent cookie and also a couple                                 other editions so that some JavaScript                                 cookies and stuff didn't get added and                                 actually we blogged about that at                                 appomattox calm / drupal dash privacy                                 and that the work we did there was                                 incorporated into press flow which was a                                 Drupal fork that had performance and                                 security additions and that work                                 actually got melded into Drupal                                      this is now something that you can do                                 you don't have to have cookies session                                 cookies off with anonymous users which                                 is a performance boost and also a                                 practice eBoost as I mentioned Aaron                                 wimborne is maintainer for media and                                 embedded media field so we've made                                 several contributions in that area                                 flickr photo sets the JW player                                 integration i mentioned before and a lot                                 of accessibility changes like captions                                 on videos and also making javascript                                 optional on certain media functionality                                 and then just in various patches to                                 Drupal core and contributed modules as                                 we found I find bugs I mean this is the                                 great thing about developing for Drupal                                 is being able to do that kind of thing                                 all right back to Jenny so besides the                                 redesign we initially did in november                                 two thousand nine we've also been able                                 to refresh and basically using the exact                                 the same architecture provides some site                                 redesign improvement so this is the what                                 the site basically looks like if you go                                 to it now which is a refried                                 reconfiguration of how we're looking                                 before so if you remember what it looked                                 like previously you'll see we actually                                 have an additional rail in the middle                                 there which allows us to more                                 prominently highlight videos and                                 podcasts to our users we've tightened up                                 the site so there's less white space in                                 it there was quite a bit of white space                                 in the old design and we've changed the                                 the block below so instead of being able                                 to filter by specific types of content                                 initially we actually have those pushed                                 below so we can highlight a little bit                                 more things above the fold in case you                                 guys don't know a lot of ACLU supporters                                 aren't necessarily the youngest and most                                 tech-savvy folks so we tend to get a lot                                 of people with smaller smaller screens                                 older browsers all of that kind of stuff                                 so we try to keep as much high up on the                                 page as we possibly can we've also added                                 as Marco mentioned we won new content                                 types we added not long ago as features                                 so we want to highlight that on the home                                 page features are one of our attempts to                                 try to move a little bit away from                                 strictly adhering to the ACLU                                 organizational structure and instead                                 talk more about the kinds of issues                                 which are happening ah the kinds of                                 issues that are going on in the news and                                 how people are discussing it there                                 rather than just how we organizationally                                 allocate that so you'll see for example                                 one of our features is private prisons                                 which is something that the ACLU is                                 active and advocating against because                                 it's bad as well as know your rights                                 which is a big campaign we have about                                 different for different users to                                 different types of folks to know what                                 kinds of rights they have to take                                 photographs of please and in other                                 situations like that so that's another                                 way for us to try to bring people into                                 the site and educate them about what the                                 ACLU is doing various areas we also                                 underwent a major blog redesign which                                 launched last month you can see on the                                 top what the blog had previously looked                                 like and as I mentioned before that was                                 a design we basically ported in whole                                 cloth from WordPress so that design as                                 of this winter was probably about five                                 you probably at four or five years old                                 and looks a little bit dated the new                                 blog redesigned on the right it looks a                                 lot more up-to-date it's a lot more                                 consistent with our current site so it                                 has something of a different look and                                 feel but it keeps the main site feature                                 so you still know that you're in the                                 ACLU experience and all that kind of                                 stuff but you also know the owner blog                                 and again we added a couple of different                                 content associations for this so the                                 trending topics block that you see there                                 it's very similar to the features that I                                 was talking about earlier it allows us                                 to give way to associate content with                                 things that are going on more actively                                 in the news so for example wireless                                 wiretapping or indefinite detention are                                 things that are being discussed a lot                                 right now in the news there are issues                                 that the ACLU works on actively so we                                 want to make sure folks know that we're                                 doing it and what resources we have                                 available on those topics specifically                                 in the blog we also introduced the                                 concept of channels which is going to                                 give us the ability to have different                                 voices within our same blog so we have a                                 Washington legislative office which                                 focuses predominantly on lobbying and                                 those kinds of efforts and they really                                 know what's going on in the hill in                                 relate in relation to our issues so we                                 want to be able to give them a space to                                 talk directly to folks who really care                                 about the more on Capitol Hill aspects                                 of the work that we do we're also going                                 to be expanding this to add a blog                                 channels focus specifically on                                 technology issues since that's something                                 that we do a lot of work on and blog is                                 a natural place to highlight where we do                                 that you'll also see that we're more                                 prominently focusing on how to share                                 things because it's                                                     to share things on the Facebook and                                 stuff and we have a much larger hero                                 image to engage folks more the other                                 cool thing we have is on every view of                                 the blog you can tell you can flip to                                 the most popular or most commented on                                 right now we're not getting a lot of                                 comments but we're hoping to enhance our                                 comedy functionality over time and get                                 more people actually comment on our work                                 and engage with our work with us and                                 we're hoping that that can be a means to                                 help drive that so one of the other                                 things that's great that we've been able                                 to do since we've been in Drupal is                                 actual                                 in-house development so as I mentioned                                 before we weren't able to touch anything                                 we pretty much had to always go to our                                 vendor and say please please add a block                                 here or whatever else like that we can                                 do that now and we've been doing more                                 and more of that we in-house can do                                 refreshes and updates bug fixes change                                 requests there are some specific menus                                 on the site which have been renamed                                 about                                                                    we're really good at renaming those um                                 and lots of other things like that it's                                 nice to be able to have the flexibility                                 to do those things in-house without                                 having to go externally to do them we've                                 also done a lot of multivariate testing                                 again because we're privacy conscious                                 and all that stuff we can't use Google                                 optimizer which I know is what most                                 nonprofits use we use omniture test and                                 target instead but that still works                                 nicely with Drupal and works well with                                 our overall implementation and we've                                 been able to do multivariate test on                                 donation path donation link placement                                 and terminology and we're plenty of                                 doing more in the coming months as well                                 and beginning to do it not just on                                 donation and fundraising but also                                 looking at it on you know click through                                 and that kind of stuff we've also                                 implemented several micro sites in                                 Drupal and we're actually going to be                                 launching another one probably in the                                 next couple of months I've got here a                                 screenshot of the torture report which                                 is when we launched maybe a year or two                                 ago again developed in Drupal                                          it's focusing on our investigation of                                 the torture programs that were conducted                                 under the Bush administration what was                                 interesting about this project is that                                 the idea of it was that it's actually a                                 kind of a book being ridden live on the                                 web so we worked with an expert in in                                 this field who was generating basically                                 chapter every few months and as that                                 chapter was developed he would post it                                 on this side and then there was a group                                 of experts who in the field who also                                 gave access to the system and we wanted                                 them to be able to basically annotate                                 the chapter as it was going up so they                                 could say oh this incident that happened                                 here there was another very similar                                 incident                                 happened there so we built in support                                 for kind of inline annotation that the                                 experts could basically do while the                                 chapter was being written and then we                                 also had comments though folks who                                 weren't necessarily part of that group                                 could comment on the chapter as well so                                 one of the major new projects that we've                                 been working on and that we're hoping to                                 launch in the next couple of weeks touch                                 wood is a replacement of Canvio so as                                 marco mentioned earlier we've used all                                 of our we've used can video for all of                                 our online interactivity donations                                 advocacy petitions legal intake etc and                                 we're moving into Jackson rivers                                 springboard system which is actually a                                 best-of-breed system rather than a one                                 one size fits all solution as Canvio is                                 our donation forms and petitions will be                                 in Drupal our advocacy actions will be                                 in cap whiz and email will be being sent                                 out of system called exact target and                                 all the data will be joined together in                                 the back end in a Salesforce you see our                                 I'm back end one of the things that's                                 really appealing to us about this is                                 that once we launched will have exactly                                 the same control over our donations and                                 petition functionality that we do over                                 the rest of the site which means we'll                                 really be able to control exactly what                                 field show up how the field show up                                 we're on the page they show up the                                 different layout all of that kind of                                 stuff those of you who have worked with                                 canvio know that you know you get a set                                 number of options or you could use the                                 API but we don't have the built-in                                 flexibility that we will have once we're                                 fully interval so donation forms and                                 petitions will use web form and that                                 Lewbert modules and the thing that's                                 great is we basically leverage our                                 existing Drupal infrastructure for all                                 of that so our themes we won't have to                                 update them now into systems will just                                 need to update them in one system and                                 that will apply everywhere and the                                 existing infrastructure that we already                                 have around permanent cookies around                                 users around login security all of that                                 kind of stuff will work out of the gate                                 because we're building into our existing                                 infrastructure there's also going to be                                 a couple of syncing processes that we                                 have to set up those sinks between                                 Drupal and sales force which is part of                                 the standard springboard implementation                                 and then we also have had a custom                                 module implemented so we can do a sink                                 of all of our donation records between                                 our donor database of record which we                                 use pidi for that and that's actually a                                 drupal module which generates a gift                                 sync file which would then export out                                 and to our donor database of record as I                                 mentioned the form look and feel will                                 now be seamlessly integrated with the                                 rest of the site but we also be will                                 have the ability to support affiliates                                 so right now we have a program with                                 about half of our affiliates where they                                 participate in a shared email marketing                                 program which means we share a list we                                 share our commitment to user privacy and                                 we share you know expertise on how to                                 create forms and best practices and all                                 that kind of stuff the affiliates once                                 we launch and springboard will have                                 direct access to our Drupal back-end and                                 be able to create donation forms                                 petitions event registration all of that                                 within that system but it will look like                                 them so there's been a page wrapper set                                 up built in that allows you to apply the                                 affiliate look and feel around the form                                 so they can still maintain their                                 distinct Brandon I don't know how well                                 any of you know the ACLU and our                                 affiliate relationships we love our                                 affiliates but they're all very                                 independent so it's important that they                                 can maintain that independence um                                 confirmation pages have been configured                                 for all of this which are not actually                                 separate nodes but generated as part of                                 the existing node and they're                                 automatically sent email confirmations                                 as well the other thing that school is                                 it will be able to generate our own                                 templates for petitions and other types                                 of forms again those of you that are                                 familiar with convene know that for                                 example for advocacy actions you get a                                 set of layouts and themes that you can                                 use and you can't really vary from that                                 and less again you want to do the API                                 implementation which it's feasible but                                 is some work will be able to actually                                 generate our own templates and themes                                 within Drupal and have those applied                                 which is very exciting for us and one of                                 the things that we're looking forward to                                 doing is trying to do a lot of testing                                 to figure out what do our users respond                                 to both in terms of what data we collect                                 from them and how we please                                 that to them and it's something we're                                 excited about trying to figure out so we                                 can optimize that path for our                                 constituents one of the other projects                                 that we've worked on has been a updated                                 search for torture FOIA documents so                                 again one of the major areas in which we                                 work is in investigating the tort or                                 programs that went on under the Bush                                 administration and we have an existing                                 search which you can see on the side on                                 which basically it tries to expose to                                 users what what toyo requests have                                 yielded so we've I don't know                                        documents or something like that that                                 we've gotten from FOIA requests related                                 to the torture programs and we want                                 those to be accessible we think that                                 that kind of transparency will help                                 people and being aware of what's going                                 on and prevent it from ever happening                                 again um that searched on the left that                                 you see or bright rather is super old                                 school it's basically a custom my sequel                                 database with some PHP in front of it                                 and doesn't have very many fields and                                 all that kind of stuff so what's been                                 implemented we're hoping to launch                                 probably in the next couple of months is                                 a new search using apache solr which you                                 can see on the other side has a lot more                                 facets and all that kind of stuff and                                 Marco jump in about yeah this is an                                 ideal test case for Apache Solr because                                 not only is there a lot of content you                                 know we have thousands of these torture                                 documents that some of these documents                                 are hundreds and hundreds of pages long                                 so you know it's you wouldn't want to                                 use your triple core search system for                                 this and on the far right there you can                                 see some of the facets that we're using                                 for this search it's you know out of the                                 box Apache Solr comes with some you know                                 really great facets that you can use                                 taxonomy you can use content type but                                 it's really easy to to customize these                                 facets for your needs so like that we                                 have a date facet there instead of                                 showing the number of documents                                 parenthesis that that you could find we                                 have this little bar graph that's easy                                 to navigate if you click on a month                                 there it actually updates and it becomes                                 up I'm sorry if you click on a year                                 there it updates and it becomes a per                                 month bar graph and you can kind of dive                                 in to document searching that way we                                 also have these really deep hierarchies                                 in terms of with the officials on the                                 torture document what would the                                 interrogation methods used and it's it's                                 hard to tell here but you can kind of                                 open multiple levels of that taxonomy to                                 really dive in deep into what you're                                 looking for and then right above the                                 date bar graph there's a little advanced                                 search form that expands and gives you a                                 bunch of different filters like                                 autocomplete fields so you can search                                 for a particular official you can do                                 date wages and all of this is using                                 solar but it's sort of like on top of                                 the existing solar you know what comes                                 with the facet blocks so that I provided                                 kept coming yeah sorry the FAFSA blocks                                 that come with solar we've built some                                 functionality on top of that to                                 customize them for this particular                                 search so it's great I mean it's really                                 fast and it gives a really good UI                                 experience for the kind of people using                                 this site which are people do you know                                 researchers where I really need to get                                 deep down to the data and one of the                                 other thing that's great about the                                 autocomplete that Marco mentioned is                                 that you know a lot of the names who are                                 in here they might have multiple aliases                                 or they might be known by titles as well                                 as by names so the autocomplete actually                                 will prompt for will try to look for any                                 of those variants and then if you search                                 on one it'll search on all of them so it                                 allows you to you know maybe you know no                                 only that it was the Secretary of State                                 who is involved in a specific memo or                                 something like that if you search on                                 that it will search on the specific                                 names that are associated with the                                 Secretary of State all so it allows like                                 Marco said for folks who are really                                 knowledgeable about stuff to do a lot of                                 searching as well as folks who are lost                                 knowledgeable                                 which is exactly what this we want this                                 to be we want it to be a tool that can                                 be used by scholars who are researching                                 this and other advocates in this area as                                 well as a way to expose to the general                                 public k this is what went on and we're                                 actually hearing this from the horse's                                 mouth so for future plans obviously we                                 want to upgrade to Drupal                                               in Drupal                                                   organizations we're probably going to                                 take that as an opportunity to                                 reevaluate our current information                                 architecture as Marco talked about right                                 now the core of our information                                 architecture is run around the campaign                                 project issue hierarchy and that                                 something is an organization that we're                                 beginning to move away from we're trying                                 to become a bit more lateral there been                                 some organizational changes that are in                                 support of that so we're probably going                                 to reopen that conversation and see if                                 it really makes sense to continue                                 working with that campaign project issue                                 hierarchy or if we want to move to                                 something more like a taxonomy or                                 something like that no matter what we do                                 we'll probably still end up being a                                 pretty structured information                                 architecture because we work on so many                                 different issues that we need a way to                                 guide our users through what we're                                 actually doing because otherwise it just                                 becomes a massive content that you know                                 has thousands of potential tags and                                 overlaps it can be very difficult to                                 navigate through we're also looking at                                 doing redesign refreshes of various                                 areas of the site again this will be                                 kind of in line with what we did with                                 the homepage which won't necessarily be                                 predicated on the triple seven upgrade                                 or an architectural review but we'll                                 just make the look and feel a little bit                                 fresher so we're going to be looking at                                 the multimedia center this year the                                 Action Center which is where we                                 highlight our actions from previously                                 convenio soon to be springboard we're                                 also looking at as I mentioned earlier                                 enhanced commenting functionality and                                 probably some other side areas who might                                 enhance the features area that kind of                                 stuff and then one of the things                                 obviously that we need to get more into                                 is a mobile program um we're hoping to                                 both do a mobile version of the website                                 maybe using responsive design so it can                                 be                                 it can respond well not just to mobile                                 but different browser sizes and all that                                 kind of stuff as well as looking into                                 doing SMS and applications and all of                                 that kind of stuff so that pretty much                                 covers what we wanted to cover do you                                 guys have questions comments thoughts                                 anybody anybody crickets                                 how did you make the decision to switch                                 from convio to springboard what that's                                 when it um it was a slow and laborious                                 decision as almost all the decisions at                                 our organization are it's something we                                 had been thinking about for a while                                 because as we grew with technical                                  expertise and within our organization we                                  really wanted flexibility and                                  convenience for you out of the box you                                  don't need to necessarily think through                                  how all of these things together and all                                  those kinds of things but if you start                                  to want to move beyond that and do a lot                                  of customization you can hit some limits                                  with it so the idea of being a will have                                  a much more flexible system was really                                  what drove us in terms of that we want                                  to be in control of our destiny rather                                  than have an organization's roadmap be                                  dictating some of that to us we also                                  like the idea of like I said before it's                                  a best-of-breed system so we're going to                                  be using you know exact target for                                  emails and cap waves for advocacy if                                  over time we find that those aren't                                  meeting our needs will be able to swap                                  those out at a piecemeal fashion fashion                                  without changing the overall structure                                  and that's also very appealing we get to                                  choose like what's important to us what                                  we want to change all of those things so                                  we basically had like a year-long                                  evaluation process and Tom and TJ can                                  chime in on that as well as if they were                                  part of the whole thing where we talked                                  about what we wanted to do and what made                                  sense Thanks I actually thought of                                  another question too how did your                                  department build your expertise in                                  Drupal to the point where you were                                  patching Drupal core and making modules                                  like what was the training process for                                  that very much time did you to vote to                                  it we're not patching to full core I                                  don't think oh yes I changer Bullock or                                  yeah I've done that was my friend of the                                  slides I swear maybe you meant we'd                                  something else we do fixes of our own                                  code and stuff like that but not                                  actually getting into core but both                                  avocado Miriam went to Drupal well mari                                  I'm came in later and charity Hydra                                  experience but all Akash went to Drupal                                  training to a couple of different ones I                                  think so I mean it's just training and                                  then playing with code and seeing how it                                  works thank you yeah we didn't really                                  pass Drupal core with it to do the                                  cookie security stuff that you need to                                  replace the session files but that's                                  actually there's a way to do that                                  without patching core but yeah try to                                  avoid that one possible I work at an                                  academic library and we have similar                                  patron privacy concerns and I'm                                  wondering how you handle analytics                                  across across multiple systems with the                                  concern for privacy so we use                                  sitecatalyst from omniture which can be                                  configured to work without permanent                                  cookies so we use only session based                                  information from that and that can also                                  work across multiple sites it's a                                  JavaScript file that you can call as an                                  include from anywhere so that's the                                  primary way that we handle it and we                                  just make sure that absolutely no                                  personally identifiable information is                                  passed into sitecatalyst so you can                                  control exactly what fields are passed                                  in from various pages um so like Anna                                  donation will pass over how much the                                  donation was but nothing else we don't                                  pass zip code we don't pass name nothing                                  that was part of what was appealing to                                  us about using something like                                  sitecatalyst because it gives us quite a                                  bit of control over exactly what we                                  report on the flip side that is                                  configuration of it can be a bear as I'm                                  sure Akash can attest to but it's worked                                  well for us over time Google Analytics                                  several of our affiliates also use and                                  there's actually way to hack google                                  analytics so it doesn't least use                                  permanent cookies which is why are some                                  of our flights are able to use it but                                  I'm not as familiar with that limitation                                  thank you                                  anyone else anyone anyone all right                                  thanks you guys and feel free to ask us                                  reflections
