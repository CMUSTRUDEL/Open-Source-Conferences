Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: DRUPAL COMMERCE CONTRIB OVERVIEW
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	Drupal Commerce provides a lean core of commerce functionality, which is meant to be extended with contrib modules for common use cases. But there are hundred of different use cases, and Drupal Commerce on its own can't cover it all. And that's where the magic of the Drupal community comes in. These days everyone is writing a Commerce module. Shipping, stock, migration, affiliation, payment methods, lions, tigers and more! (OK, maybe not lions and tigers). Currently there are more than 50 solutions already implemented and contributed back. This presentation will show you what the "golden" contribs are, covering the most popular use cases, then do a rapid fly-over of other contributed modules on the horizon. Finally we'll show you how we (and you) can keep up with them.

Questions answered by this session: 
What are the top contrib modules for commerce you need to know about?
Is there a module for doing X in commerce?
But... do I need a module for doing X?
Which contrib solutions are the most stable?
How do I can keep track of the new modules?

questions and if you are if you are like                                down in there in the room you can go to                                the mic there and just ask because if                                not that is going to be                                                 talking so please ask me questions so                                first things first drupal commerce is a                                framework as it is now and it ships with                                many core features but we have some                                things that we left in the country                                universe such as shipping and you say                                that you need shipping for your for your                                online store but not for every store so                                shipping is a country model is one of                                the essentials                                                   technically provides a line item type                                and it takes care of the checkout                                process so you can select the ship in                                there and it's really rules based so you                                can decide or or you can manage all your                                shipping behaviors through rules as it                                is now I think that the                                               no shipping methods right so it's                                pluggable and extendable because if not                                you won't have any shipping adult so                                there is should support for flat rate                                ups any other one remarkable another                                post okay                                so you can if you don't find one you one                                model that fits your needs is really is                                really friendly to extend and you can                                see more examples are the other                                essential it looks really nice ER in my                                screen sorry for the blank thing here                                and is the stock thing the commerce                                stock is ok it's a way to maintaining                                track stock for product yeah and as                                normally the online stores Minaj stock                                as they want no nobody watches talk the                                same way its rules based so you can                                decide when you decrease stock and when                                you when you grease it again if your                                order is cancelled or not or I don't                                know so it's really flexible and it also                                has had two old version that is the one                                you should be using and this version                                supports things like decimal stocks or                                liters and things like that yeah you can                                create your own rules for stock                                behaviors even for a service stock or or                                or crazy stuff like that so the next                                category of countries is import and                                export so the main models for getting                                stuff into commerce from other sources                                are feed sammy great we have                                integrations with commerce fees and                                comment from great and both are ways to                                import products fits actually support                                customer profiles and recently coupons                                and the way it works is that it allows                                you to import the product bar at but                                also the the references so you can                                import probes and displays and                                and link them together in the in the                                process Demi great approach uses the                                Democrat model and it's slightly                                 different but it also has a you work                                 hard to commerce supermodel so you can                                 import you work our stores into commerce                                 directly using the sub model from                                 commerce me great and another stuff for                                 for import and export it's kind of                                 different but we have features                                 integration with you by using the                                 commerce featured model and it currently                                 supports pearl types customer profiles                                 line item types and other stuff in there                                 so you can stage your structure between                                 between between installations there are                                 a couple more there is an xml export for                                 roads and displays but you probably may                                 want to use vuze for that and this one                                 is the order ftp export exports xml and                                 settings and it sends it over ftp so i                                 know this is a really really specific                                 use case but it sir there is also a                                 commerce service model but again and as                                 the xml you may want to use vuze for                                 that some views data source or one of                                 these models to to export things ok so                                 physical products and for those of you                                 pretending to sell physical stuff i mean                                 maybe it's not that trendy but we have a                                 solution for that commerce physical uses                                 the physical field model for our treat                                 dimensions and weight in many many mesh                                 measurement units so it's a great way to                                 it's a great way to store store                                 dimensions and weight the proper way so                                 this allows you to calculate shipping                                 costs I think that the upa UPS model                                 does that so you can track your your                                 shipping God's cost with a physical                                 thing okay so most it more interesting                                 stuff or the non physical product non                                 physical products are like subscriptions                                 file downloads or whatever you don't                                 ship to your to your clients or your                                 customers let's start with commerce file                                 so commerce file is a way okay to solve                                 file access to the yeah it's a good name                                 right so its rules based as all the                                 models with commerce with because we                                 have a really Stern rules integration so                                 it allows you to limit the number of                                 downloads the the access to the files                                 through rules and there is also a                                 commerce downloads installed profile                                 that includes this model pre-configured                                 are ready to use if you want to test it                                 quickly you can check that install                                 profile and yeah and it's ready to sell                                 like I know he books or music or                                 whatever you don't use all access to                                 through the file system of Rupa okay                                 this is a slightly different one is a                                 product key it generates product keys or                                 vouchers that you can associate to your                                 product so normally is used to unlock                                 software like keys for for apps or                                 of something like that so you can sell                                 these through Commerce and you get a                                 final order with a key and you can                                 assign it or unassign it to your                                 prototypes so again these rules based                                 you can track it and control stock and                                 and all this cool stuff more things to                                 sell or to manage non physical product                                 or the commerce trade and commerce user                                 point are two ways of reached the same                                 the same point the Commerce crate                                 provides a way to buy or wing crates to                                 to your users and it has an expiration                                 feature so they can expire and I know                                 you can use these for for retain                                 customers like giving them great for                                 each purchase so they can get stuff for                                 free or something like that and the                                 commerce user point that has been                                 released quite recently and yeah it's a                                 breach between Commerce and user point                                 and provides a way to get user points                                 through your commerce so it's                                 not a payment gateway at all it's just                                 that you can use a number of your                                 previous user points already earned to                                 pay to pay some part of the products                                 you're you're buying okay subscriptions                                 it's not that is a final solution for                                 subscriptions but you have a couple of                                 options out there the Commerce                                 subscription one is entity type that                                 allows you to solve roles and I think it                                 only works with people right now so                                 right                                 okay so I mean it's just a nice Pacific                                 use case but you can use it and the                                 second one is commerce SP or or I think                                 that's a proud cover the break name is a                                 feature that use rules schedule so you                                 can sell subscriptions be a product okay                                 check out face any questions out there                                 yeah so I think it attached the                                 subscriptions to a product is that your                                 bi approach that is has a scripture that                                 represents a subscription subscription I                                 think that there are two different one I                                 mean the first one is a subscription                                 entity that is fillable and i think that                                 the second one and uses a prototype for                                 the in subscriptions                                 yeah hmm couple of coasters bar                                 I think so i think that the question is                                 that the first one the comment                                 subscription is only using paypal                                 because that's the only recurring                                 subscription method that is like easy to                                 implement yeah i think that is a tough                                 thing and they use paypal already so                                 they will probably implement something                                 more in the future but i think they are                                 good with this and you probably can                                 implement your own base it on this on                                 synthetic can you can you reach the mic                                 thank you with the supplies module be                                 appropriate for like a membership of a                                 person to an association which one the                                 supplies one supplies yeah the commerce                                 subscription supplies module I know the                                 supplies is not the name of the model                                 its just oh okay they were sorry so what                                 are any of these appropriate then for                                 managing a an association membership                                 i'ii pay my annual dues yeah yeah but                                 you did more than these to do that but                                 probably you you need a way to do the                                 recurring payments and that's the                                 options out there at the moment will be                                 more but yeah you need more I will show                                 you I will show other thing in next                                 slides yeah                                 create is much more older model user                                 points has her released like I don't                                 know since one month or so so it wasn't                                 really ready for use before so you have                                 to evaluate if you don't have user                                 points and you need a simple approach                                 you probably need you probably use great                                 yeah is the same thing the same thing                                 none of them are payment method is just                                 discount thing more question from this                                 now okay next check out okay this is one                                 of the most important models I would I                                 was going to put it in the essentials                                 but is not that essential as shipping                                 assist officer or stock is the feel-good                                 paint what a name pains right feel-good                                 pains you can you know if you know the                                 field group modeled it was it used to be                                 in CC k and now it's a separate project                                 it allows you to place different fields                                 into a group so you can export those                                 into the into the order or entity and                                 you can ask to the user for to the                                 customer in the checkout face for these                                 for these information such as other                                 comments or I don't know or whatever                                 field you want to expose their and it's                                 really useful to our registration                                 website where you can feel more                                 information about your users in

Association website and we ask                                 for the for the Drupal or username in                                 registration so they can pay your there                                 their quota yeah yeah the way to do that                                 it's replicate is duplicate in the field                                 both in the order entity and the user                                 entity and you can do that you can                                 assign information with a rule in the                                 check out da Platina sorry but then so                                 you can save extra information in                                 whatever entity you're using do you just                                 need to duplicate the fields and it will                                 be you create the rule and it will be                                 copied there yeah yeah absolutely and                                 it's in the order so you can expose                                 hitting views or whatever you need so                                 Mauro okay I get fancy with with the                                 structure because if not is really                                 boring so more check out thing the                                 Commerce extra pain follow sorry for the                                 bad joke is it allows you to expose                                 notes in the paint in the checkout                                 process and it has a super model for the                                 terms of service so you can have you can                                 expose a checkbox there you can have the                                 same functionality with the with the                                 field world paint like exposing and I                                 agree to the terms and conditions in the                                 checkout but this one has a solution out                                 of the box and you can assign a note too                                 that Congress check out logging provides                                 a check out pain to to request                                 information about the login so you can                                 login in the check out instead of                                 allowing anonymous user orders you can                                 expose the login login form so it's a                                 different approach                                 okay check out prof progress it provides                                 this provides block and list of the                                 check out this is really common you are                                 in the checkout face you're in the                                 review you are in the payment so the                                 user knows were worse where is the in                                 each moment of the of the process if                                 this only works if you have a multi-page                                 check out obviously if you wanna if you

                       show the user worries hey check out                                 pages without this model do need to code                                 to create new checkout pages and this                                 one provides how you I for creating                                 these pages so you can assign pains to                                 them if you need if you need to have to                                 extract checkout pages because commerce                                 chips with the check out one the review                                 the

           categories because I'm not reviewing the                                 ton of payment methods that models that                                 that are out there but we have the major                                 ones like PayPal out for either gone and                                 there is a number huge number of local                                 payment methods for normally their                                 country based if you're if you are in a                                 country if that doesn't have a payment                                 method please great one                                 and do you get a lot of examples because                                 they are like literally hundreds of them                                 and also there are other payment methods                                 available like the bank transfer cold or                                 shake or there are many many of manual                                 payment methods that you can use so next                                 one crowd management I don't know if you                                 hear this but oh yeah yeah so was a                                 question about payment methods yeah                                 we've done this an uber cart we sell a                                 lot to big companies that customarily by                                 on purchase orders and put the but they                                 wanted the convenience of checking out                                 through you know online store and                                 obviously we have to do things like like                                 decide who we're going to accept                                 purchase orders from uh-huh but this I                                 think would be a desirable payment                                 method is for approved users but                                 possibly users with a certain role that                                 the there is a payment method called                                 purchase order that lets them in a                                 purchase order number and some details                                 and then check out yeah I think dursa                                 yeah thank you endured                                 yeah if you can go to the mic he's so                                 there is in fact a commerce purchase                                 order payment method it's pretty basic                                 just pops up a field that allows them to                                 put in but is one question I have about                                 payment is there going to be a way to                                 open payment methods by role or because                                 it looks like from when you need to                                 enable a payment method it's available                                 to anyone who can check out is that is                                 that the case is there an inflatable                                 module now is that there is a event                                 provides Byron rules in the Commerce                                 rules integration that is a select I                                 think it's called selective eligible                                 payment methods okay so you can throw                                 conditions there and you can not only by                                 the customer role but whatever                                 conditions you can you can think of that                                 is rules ways you can you can filter out                                 payment methods okay so you have to do                                 it to the rules interfaces yeah like a                                 commission setting or whatever all right                                 thank

     create several fields and naming so it's                                 a more generic approach like having not                                 having one of these ones but you can

                       help you price table is really useful                                 for retailer retailer stores or well all                                 stores that sell products and the price                                 depends on the quantity that the user is                                 purchasing so it will expose price table                                 basically and if you if you select if                                 you buy more than whatever quantity the                                 price changes and I need stories and                                 it's replace it in the in the in the                                 check out in the card face and it works                                 and another one if you are working with                                 several currencies is the commerce                                 multi-currency model it's a really great                                 model it provides two ways to manage                                 multi-currency the first one is with an                                 automatic rate exchange provided by an                                 external service I think that the                                 default is the European Central Bank but                                 you can provide your own or you have a                                 manual way to do it with manual exchange                                 rates or and it all it also provides two                                 fields or a field / currency so you can                                 go more even more manual than that more                                 extra price for matters and price                                 savings for matter are two models that                                 expose a different pricing display the                                 second one it's really useful if you                                 have discount because you can display                                 the normal price and the discounted                                 price and                                 how under saving that the customer is                                 getting and the first one has them more                                 or less the same functionality but also                                 other other for mothers there are a                                 bunch of them there yeah you have two                                 questions and I'm kind of referencing                                 the ubercart multi price module which                                 handles multiple currencies for uber                                 card mm-hmm and it has some capabilities                                 that we do is real important that I                                 didn't see in that previous slide on                                 multi currency there are certainly a lot                                 of people who just offer the same                                 product at this same sort of worldwide                                 price just with exchange rate conversion                                 uh-huh some people do that but lots and                                 lots of other people set prices by                                 currency or set prices by country yeah                                 right so you have a published price list                                 in euros and post price in dollars and                                 so on yeah is this is the second way                                 that the multi-currency model works okay                                 automated exchange rate but it also if                                 you don't want the automatic exchange                                 rate you can select that it create a                                 field a price field pair currency okay                                 so you can set the price in Euros the                                 price in dollars the pricing whatever                                 currency you have and then you have to                                 do a little of extra work replacing the                                 price in the in the rules so you can get                                 you get the right currency always right                                 you know you need the nose and there                                 there's a couple of issues of first                                 picking up a default price for a new                                 visitor or new customer which you can do                                 with IP address lookup in that sort of                                 thing pick up the right default price in                                 currency and then the other thing is                                 setting a a price and currency for a                                 user at when you once they've purchased                                 so they don't come back and see a                                 different price the next time then                                 there's another issue here which also                                 appears in uber carts multi price fairly                                 recently was update                                 the last you know year but it's the                                 common situation where okay so the                                 general notion is you have price levels                                 right different prices for different                                 classes of customers yeah I think that                                 some of them are some customers by                                 country is one case of this about                                 another case like for us we have                                 academic prices and we have commercial                                 user prices and we have government                                 crisis and so on so how how can you have                                 this in Drupal commerce that yeah you                                 have all the price calculation is based                                 in rules you have a you have a rules                                 even to change the price calculation so                                 you can decide in with some conditions                                 which price are you sure we know to eat                                 or how are you modifying the price okay                                 so I understand there is that general                                 mechanism and that's very useful but                                 this is the control section right so I'm                                 kind of looking to see if there is a                                 controversial that has handled this case                                 just for example pricing by role is an                                 example yeah but you have you can manage                                 that with the general general approach                                 you can check the role of dick okay so                                 customer I'd have to write that                                 contribute if I wanted it right to price                                 my role you can use the default rules                                 set when the price is calculated check                                 the role and modify the price but you                                 can also yeah you can also write your                                 own set of rules or whatever integration                                 too easy these these operations but you                                 should be able to do it by the flyby out                                 of the box really okay if you have                                 further things with this we can discuss                                 it later so next things okay a price                                 history is displaced the change of the                                 price in the history of a product and                                 price by components is a way to                                 split the price components into rules                                 and interviews so you can display price                                 without taxes or price without a                                 discount in some in some environments or                                 or some situations the invoicing part is                                 kind of funny because we have like four                                 different models that have four                                 different approaches so you have to                                 choose whatever it fits for you                                 conversing boys create an invoice entity                                 commerce order in Boise grace and in                                 Boise State for the order entity                                 conversing boys received creates an                                 invoice display for the order entity and                                 then you have the PDF t okay so you can                                 choose you should choose whatever fits                                 for you because these are really                                 different approaches utilities is                                 miscellanea I couldn't figure category                                 for this one's the address book should                                 be really in the sense else it just got                                 to point out release and it basically                                 allows you to allows the customer to                                 select previous address enter it in the                                 system and also provides a checkbox to                                 copy the address between the different                                 customer profiles that you can expose                                 and check out yeah                                 I think so yeah I think so we can try                                 that but i think that is only with                                 registered users I mean that the copy                                 thing no the cop eating works with                                 everything but the select previous                                 address is just for registered users                                 yeah sorry the shipping model provides a                                 shipping a customer profile so yeah yeah                                 yeah i mean the Commerce provides a                                 default building profile and shipping                                 provides a shipping profile so the copy                                 will work because there are the same                                 thing and usually the selected previous                                 address should work as well does that                                 answer your question more or less okay                                 coupons next one I'm sorry okay coupons                                 is a coupon functionality is in I would
