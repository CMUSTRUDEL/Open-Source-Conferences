Description: 
	It should come as no surprise to Drupal folk that healthy, effective and prolific communities brim with excited and engaged contributors. But what are the secrets of creating that healthy community? And how do you keep it healthy over time? Rather than some more esoteric matter, effective community management is a matter of good customer service. In this talk, Amye Scavarda and Leslie Hawthorn will show how to apply the basic tenets of customer service to growing and sustaining your community, including:
Welcoming Well
Getting the Order Correct
Dealing with Fussy Eaters
Completing the Transaction
Keeping Your Store Clean
Taking Care of Your Regulars
