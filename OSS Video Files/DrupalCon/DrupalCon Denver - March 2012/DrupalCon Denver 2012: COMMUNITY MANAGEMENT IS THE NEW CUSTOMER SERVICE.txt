Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	It should come as no surprise to Drupal folk that healthy, effective and prolific communities brim with excited and engaged contributors. But what are the secrets of creating that healthy community? And how do you keep it healthy over time? Rather than some more esoteric matter, effective community management is a matter of good customer service. In this talk, Amye Scavarda and Leslie Hawthorn will show how to apply the basic tenets of customer service to growing and sustaining your community, including:
Welcoming Well
Getting the Order Correct
Dealing with Fussy Eaters
Completing the Transaction
Keeping Your Store Clean
Taking Care of Your Regulars

Questions answered by this session: 
What makes a community healthy?
How can I help make my community more effective?
I would like my community not to suck. Is this possible even if I am not a people expert?
What tactics are useful when dealing with difficult people?
Was it actually worth my while misspending my youth working at fast food restaurants now that I am a l33t Drupal haxor?

Hawthorne I've been a community manager                                for the past six years working with                                various open source projects most

      from the project management side of the                                world but I've been in Drupal for the                                past four years so I'm kind of here to                                talk about how Drupal fits in with this                                idea of community management so also you                                can feel free to interrupt us at any

                             we are interrupt driven humans so feel                                free to interrupt whenever you need to                                we sure are and we wanted to start off                                this presentation with a conversation                                about our you know weird summer jobs I                                was up in Alaska for one summer trying                                to work with people in terms of their                                various expectations of what their                                Alaskan experience was going to be like                                and what was actually going to happen                                awesome um really quick before I kind of                                kick off into my customer service                                background how many folks in the                                audience have worked retail all right                                how many of you have worked in a                                restaurant food service okay how many of                                you your first job was like hacking on                                Drupal or doing something technology                                related and everything that we say about                                retail is going to confuse you awesome                                you can take the customer perspective                                very nice so I my first job when I was                                in high school was actually working at                                round table pizza has anyone eaten round                                table pizza it's tasty um and I was                                working at the flagship store of the                                chain for the the founders son and he                                had a very strong emphasis on a high                                quality customer service and then my                                next job after that was working at a                                noah's bagels slingin bagels and I was a                                shift leader there and one of the                                reasons why this talk topic I thought                                was really important to discuss was I                                realized that getting my start and                                community management where I had no                                previous experience in community man                                it was actually fundamentally because I                                had a great background and grounding in                                customer service jobs so we're talking                                about our open source community                                management restaurant after a fashion                                and we kind of wanted to lay out where                                we're going here we're going to talk                                about welcoming well making sure that                                you're bringing people into your                                community menu accuracy making sure that                                your menu matches your dish getting your                                order correct about just you know                                focusing on listening dealing with fussy                                eaters keeping your store clean taking                                care of your regulars and completing the                                transaction and we're going to provide a                                stick towards the open source community                                management theme up you may wander off                                from time to time we wander it's what we                                do that being said also the restaurant                                metaphor we have to stretch sometimes                                but that's okay it's after lunch so none                                of you'll be hungry so welcoming well                                how many of you have ever walked into a                                restaurant and there's a podium for a                                host or hostess and yet there is no one                                standing there and there's no sign                                indicating whether or not you ought to                                seat yourself and perhaps even someone                                walks up behind you and just goes around                                you and goes around you and sits down                                that's an incredibly uncomfortable                                feeling you don't know what the protocol                                is you don't want to be offensive you're                                actually there to fulfill an immediate                                need right I need food and yet you're                                not really quite sure how to get started                                and I actually think that Drupal is an                                excellent example of a project that                                 welcomes well let's just take a look at                                 the front page of drupal.org right there                                 are actually two vectors of entry for                                 getting started so if you've never been                                 there before you already have an example                                 of where to go and you have a sample                                 protocol right and even better you                                 bodily got the small one up there for                                 people are used to looking at navigation                                 buttons you got giganto button grey a                                 drupal and it also says why why you                                 choose drupal at the same time just                                 above there so you have a good idea of                                 what it is you're going for                                 so part of welcoming well is setting the                                 expectations of what it is you're going                                 to provide if you are in fact the                                 steakhouse say that you are a steakhouse                                 if you're a vegan restaurant say that                                 you're vegan restaurant people going to                                 either one expecting that you're going                                 to be able to get stated a vegan place                                 and you know amazing grilled tofu at a                                 steakhouse these might be possible but                                 they are not going to be something                                 that's going to make all of your                                 customers happy be what it is that you                                 are and stick with it and it's also                                 especially important to when you're                                 being clear about what you're doing and                                 you know setting expectations for your                                 community we all get great ideas about                                 things that we can do to improve the                                 various projects we work in and we often                                 have more enthusiasm than we have time                                 and that's totally cool this is going to                                 happen to everyone in every community at                                 some point so if you've got an amazing                                 idea and you've gone out and you told                                 all your friends and you've tweeted                                 about it and you've posted about it on                                 Facebook Google+ and you've made you                                 know a big charge like this is the                                 greatest idea ever we should totally do                                 it and then you don't get around to it                                 that's okay make sure you're posting                                 status updates make sure you're letting                                 folks know that you're still thinking                                 about this that way you have set                                 expectations for what you're providing                                 and you're actually keeping people                                 engaged even if you're not able to                                 deliver as quickly as you'd like if                                 you're going to create investment this                                 is a good way to be able to keep that                                 I'm keeping along with the same theme in                                 terms of setting expectations                                 appropriately for example you know if                                 you know someone turns up at your steak                                 house asking for delicious vegan treats                                 how many of you are familiar with the                                 subversion project version control                                 system okay great I used to share a desk                                 with one of the founders of that project                                 a gentleman by the name of Carl Fogle                                 and he told this incredibly fantastic                                 story about the importance of having a                                 mission statement for your project and                                 he basically said that you know the                                 subversion project to paraphrase decided                                 that they wanted to be a compelling                                 replacement for the CBS version control                                 system and you know not long into the                                 projects you know childhood I guess                                 somebody came along on their mailing                                 list and was just infuriated and said                                 you guys are going down the wrong track                                 completely you                                 be trying to fix CVS I don't understand                                 why you're doing this right here and                                 grant grant ranter ranter in red and the                                 response was very simple point to the                                 mission statement our mission is not to                                 improve CBS our mission is to provide a                                 compelling replacement for CBS similarly                                 when you get folks in your community who                                 have misaligned expectations about what                                 it is that there are going to get out of                                 their experience from your open source                                 project being able to point to your                                 mission statement and say I am sorry we                                 cannot provide you with your delicious                                 vegan treats in our steak house is a                                 really effective way to defuse tension                                 and send folks along on the request so                                 that they can go to the place to get the                                 things that they need when you're not                                 going to be the one to provide them so                                 one of the great things that Drupal does                                 be able to meet the mission statement is                                 create beginners groups and again that                                 getting started just making sure that                                 people can get the lay of the land to                                 understand the functionality software                                 and what it can and can't do and lots of                                 points entry in here there's online IRC                                 being able to go into groups that                                 drupal.org and scratch their own itch                                 and find whatever it is they need to                                 meet ups that happen in person like                                 support groups the conferences like                                 we're here now being able do camps                                 clinics barn raisings and barn raising                                 actually cool and I put this up here                                 from Seattle where they go and they                                 basically build a site in a weekend with                                 people that haven't done it before so                                 you really get your hands on you can go                                 in and see exactly what it will do and                                 then some of what it won't do at the                                 same time so another key aspect of                                 beginners groups is not just bringing                                 people in so that they're able to make                                 better use of the software that you're                                 producing it's also to help them you                                 know on the path to becoming new                                 contributors if that's of interest to                                 them which is great I think one thing                                 that folks don't necessarily touch on as                                 really important about beginners groups                                 is they actually help to keep down the                                 noise for those on your project to our                                 heads down getting things done not                                 saying that these folks don't want to be                                 actively engaged with the wider                                 community but there are times you                                 actually simply need to focus on the                                 project that you're working on and                                 nurturing the new ones into your                                 community isn't necessarily going to be                                 a priority for you that's okay provided                                 those folks who are just getting started                                 do have a place to go to get that                                 guidance and at the same time you also                                 want to be able to have people that have                                 been around for a long time comes                                 user experience groups and the beginner                                 scripts to be able to see how it is                                 people are just walking in perceive what                                 it is that you're doing is just landing                                 well for the audience that you think you                                 wanted to land well so given the number                                 of folks in the audience who said that                                 they've had a background in food service                                 or retail I'm pretty sure most folks are                                 familiar with this term upselling ok a                                 few guns just just for the folks who                                 when the audience may not be familiar                                 with that term upselling is the idea of                                 suggesting additional products or                                 services that your customer may wish as                                 a means of increasing your transaction                                 total so for example would you like                                 fries with that yes I was talking to use                                 the tomato example but that was way                                 better so fundamentally it's about                                 creating a desire or a need in your                                 customer or your user or your would-be                                 future contributor that wasn't actually                                 there before and for Drupal I think                                 about this is Korra's fine on its own                                 and that's great but if you provide a                                 path towards you know Corran all of the                                 various contribs and all the custom                                 things you can do with it so you can                                 build your very own Taj Mahal on the                                 internet then you're able to create a                                 path towards contribution you're being                                 able you're able to bring people in                                 generally it's no communities are a lot                                 more comfortable on a lot healthier when                                 you have a direct path towards becoming                                 a user and then becoming a major                                 contributor along the way and a big part                                 of the community management task is to                                 actually be a bridge between those                                 various steps along the ladder because                                 folks need encouragement right they just                                 need to know kind of where to go next                                 and even if there was a clear model for                                 contribution those few like you know yep                                 yep yep go go go those things are                                 invaluable oh this is my pet peeve all                                 right we will talk about fussy eaters                                 later in this talk I am a fussy eater so                                 about                                                            mortified about this I wanted to an                                 Applebee's with my mother and father for                                 dinner which was probably not the wisest                                 decision I've ever read and I was trying                                 to eat much more healthily so I looked                                 at the menu and said hey green style                                 I like green salad so I ordered a green                                 salad and I was returned a dish that had                                 some iceberg lettuce in it too very                                 sickly looking carrots a whole bunch of                                 hard-boiled eggs about I don't know four                                 or five ounces of cheddar cheese and                                 some bacon love bacon not big fan of the                                 eggs of the cheese and what I could not                                 fathom was why on earth each of these                                 ingredients wasn't listed out on the                                 menu so I'd have the opportunity to make                                 an accurate decision about the dish that                                 I was ordering so for this one let's say                                 that like here at the beast review and                                 you've decided the Caesar salad with                                 blood orange gonna be your thing today                                 and you end up with the wonderful little                                 MacDonald salad with a Caesar salad with                                 the heart in it so this is a wonderful                                 mismatch of documentation and reality                                 you've said that your community does                                 things and it's in your documentation in                                 your mission statement your IRC channel                                 topic all of that and if you end up                                 delivering something completely                                 different it creates a mismatch of                                 expectations and it's also worth noting                                 that we're very much aware of the fact                                 that documentation is always going to                                 chase development that's inevitable                                 however you know there are ways to                                 actually make that clear to folks who                                 are new to your community and make it                                 easier for them to navigate that process                                 even something as simple as you know our                                 documentation isn't always up-to-date we                                 would love your help to improve it on                                 each documentation page that's very                                 simple to display that helps people to                                 understand wait a minute my expectations                                 didn't match reality oh wait my                                 expectations have already been reset for                                 me this is no longer a poor customer                                 service experience for me and what's                                 great about being able to welcome people                                 in is that you can those newer                                 contributors can actually point to the                                 things that are missing that you've                                 glossed over because you've seen a                                 million times you're like oh I totally                                 know what that's supposed to be in there                                 and they'll be able to flag those holes                                 for you to be able to make it better so                                 it's pretty much what we've been talking                                 about it's got documentation is how you                                 communicate with everybody and it's not                                 just what's on your website it's ever                                 thing from the readme file to the                                 maintainer to the comments in your code                                 all of those sort of things point                                 towards what it is that you're about and                                 I think that Drupal does an excellent                                 job of this that I've worked with                                 several hundred open-source projects                                 over the last few years and one of the                                 things that I have noted is that                                 projects that don't focus on                                 documentation tend to waste a lot of                                 cycles simply saying the same things                                 over and over again which can lead to                                 burnout among community members which is                                 a topic that will address in a few                                 minutes but imagine again you're in a                                 restaurant and your server comes over to                                 you and lets you know about the daily                                 specials and leaves you with the menu                                 and you order optimal transaction if you                                 aren't actually putting out your                                 documentation what you have is you have                                 folks coming into your restaurant and                                 each and every time they want to order                                 your reading off the entire menu to them                                 because you haven't provided it to them                                 you're providing the same information                                 over and over and over again they're                                 becoming confused because no one could                                 possibly follow along with an entire                                 menus worth of information being spoken                                 to them frustration of bounds on both                                 sides noise point oh so one of the other                                 ways to think about Drupal is that it is                                 like a family diner in that there are so                                 many things you can order off the menu                                 and there are so many things you can get                                 involved in as well and there's it does                                 a lot of different things being able to                                 balance many needs of you know                                 developers project managers people that                                 are working on core people that are                                 working on contributors people that want                                 to be able to do mobile well you get the                                 opportunity to be able to focus on one                                 thing you can focus on many things you                                 can be interested in all of it you can                                 be interesting just some of it yep                                 I think that if you look at Drupal in                                 comparison to like let's just take                                 another project that is you know web                                 content management like the ginger                                 project I was just hanging out with a                                 bunch of these folks two weeks ago up                                 icon and if you look at their approach                                 to the basically the same problem space                                 their idea is to focus completely on the                                 code that's it if you want to do any                                 kind of extensions improvements etc etc                                 etc making it beautiful that's not                                 really a part of the Django project the                                 Django project is really just about the                                 web framework so you know it just                                 depends on your focus Drupal is the                                 family diner Django is the awesome food                                 cart where you can go and get the                                 world's best burrito but all you're                                 going to get is a burrito all right so I                                 do I like sleep so a huge part of you                                 know having a good transaction with your                                 customer is actually getting their order                                 correct right so if someone says to you                                 that they'd like such and such such and                                 such and such and such it's pretty good                                 for you if you return to the table with                                 exactly what they asked for similarly                                 with being a community manager it is all                                 about listening and listening well and                                 making sure that you're hearing what                                 people are saying and it's also about                                 effectively anticipating needs like                                 really having a good understanding of                                 your community the issues the players                                 involved so you can synthesize all that                                 into being someone who's highly                                 available responsive and reactive so if                                 you think about it in the context of                                 being in a restaurant if you see your                                 patron looking in your direction they                                 probably need another cup of coffee why                                 not show up with another cup of coffee                                 in your hand just to show that you're                                 being proactive and you're engaged and                                 that you care nikita good community                                 management is having people know that                                 you really genuinely are invested and                                 that you care and once you've heard that                                 create things your communities asking                                 for provided that it's sane and its                                 rationale is in keeping with your                                 project mission if you create the                                 roadmap of where you're going it's a lot                                 easier to be able to bring contributors                                 in                                 the use of pieces were working on right                                 now these pieces we're doing in the                                 future and these the pieces you can get                                 involved with if you don't have time now                                 here's where you can jump in later it's                                 not the end of the road think of your                                 roadmap is your opportunity to repeat                                 your order back to your customer right                                 did you actually order fries with that                                 if the answer is no I didn't get order                                 fries with that then your response                                 should be that's great let me revise                                 that order quickly mind you a great part                                 of community management is making sure                                 that you're revising that order in a                                 sane and rational fashion and then it's                                 going to involve an open dialogue with                                 your community around their expectations                                 and reality again the mismatch of                                 documentation reality and expectations                                 of reality is one of those important                                 things that you're gonna be balancing as                                 a community manager fussy eaters that                                 would be me how many of you seen the TV                                 show Portlandia we have to bring this up                                 because we actually live in Portland um                                 so all of those things that you may have                                 heard about on the internet about folks                                 inquiring about the name of the chicken                                 that they are about to eat for dinner                                 I've seen it happen there sorry it's                                 true it's true um so inevitably in your                                 restaurant business you're gonna get                                 fussy eaters right and fussy eaters are                                 difficult because guess what their                                 battle fussy in there does imply a                                 certain degree of difficulty so you're                                 going to get those fussy eaters and you                                 still want to make them happy right                                 there's still your customers they're                                 just going to need a little something                                 extra but at the same time these fussy                                 eaters might also be some of your really                                 productive folks they might also be the                                 people who are the most invested in this                                 particular project there you know think                                 about the difference between a fussy                                 eater and a foodie you might just have a                                 secret foodie on your hands instead of a                                 fussy eater or or you might have a troll                                 as everyone in the audience familiar

dinner based on                                 like an amalgamation of six different                                 foods                                 welcome to Portland this will happen to

troll I                                 want to see what I can get away with I                                 want to push some boundaries right in                                 your community

being overly vocal and not letting                                 anyone else have an opportunity to share                                 their voice they could do something that                                 creates a stir that drives other people                                 away if you can imagine you're fussy                                 eater you know standing up and declaring                                 you know all out anger about the fact                                 that they got champagne vinaigrette                                 instead of balsamic and they really                                 wanted balsamic well not only do you                                 have to soothe your fussy eater and or                                 take care of your troll problem in the                                 meantime everyone around you and that                                 restaurant just wants to leave                                 somebody's making a scene it's in                                 Clinton present yeah and you don't want                                 to lose out on the contributions of                                 those who remain invested because you                                 have a fussy eater secret role but at                                 the same time um it may also be someone                                 that has a different expectation of what                                 it is you do so what happens if you say                                 something a different way is this is                                 just a difference between liking our                                 cultural mismatch are you being hooked                                 by the language that they're using and                                 you can't take them seriously because of                                 that look around that and see if again                                 they're just someone that's going to be                                 a great investment but they're just not                                 there quite yet and again going back to                                 our earlier theme about you know sending                                 folks along on their quest some                                 customers are just going to be a bad                                 investment how many of you have had that                                 one person you kept coming back and                                 finally just might your manager and say                                 it said please tell so-and-so to never                                 come back again I've totally done it                                 never ever ever again the way and it's                                 totally fine it is important to invest                                 time into members of your community who                                 may not you know fit the general bell                                 curve of who you're expecting to be                                 there they again maybe some of your most                                 productive folks or your secret foodies                                 on the other hand it's totally fine to                                 be like yes thank you but no thank you                                 we don't need your business mind you                                 there are much more play ways to say                                 that                                 for example the another example from the                                 subversion community there was a new                                 contributor who came along and was                                 extremely excited and was highly                                 productive but eventually people just                                 got to the point where they were                                 overwhelmed because this person would                                 reply to every single email sent to the                                 mailing list I mean every single one of                                 them they were always polite they were                                 usefully usually constructive messages                                 but every single post they finally ran                                 some stats and figured out that you know                                                                                                         had sent                                                                taking up all the oxygen that's not good                                 for your community even if someone isn't                                 trying to be a bad investment as a                                 customer they still can be the                                 resolution to this was actually that                                 somebody picked up the phone gave the                                 gentleman a column said you know we                                 really appreciate your enthusiasm but                                 unfortunately given the stage that the                                 project is in right now I think that we                                 really need to focus more on code rather                                 than discussion and if you could stop                                 posting every reply to every message                                 that would be really great an incredibly                                 helpful to us and you know again with                                 your secret foodies people who are                                 really passionately invested this                                 individuals responsible to say I'm so                                 sorry I had no idea I was causing these                                 difficulties for folks happy to rein it                                 in which is a great onion that kind of                                 story keeping your store keen how many                                 of you had to mop the floor every day                                 when you were done with work but he just                                 wanted to go home cuz you're done yeah                                 Oh done and I didn't idea not doing that                                 again so this is really just sort of an                                 encapsulation of all the best practices                                 that we've been addressing so far in                                 this presentation if you don't keep your                                 store clean when you're a restaurant                                 woody get mess and get this from produce                                 rodents of unusual size is the things                                 list saying things with legs that you do                                 not want no it's just not good if you                                 don't keep an eye on things keep your                                 store clean keep your house clean in                                 your community you're going to end up                                 with trolls or possibly rodent so you                                 want to be keeping in mind always that                                 you're this is about keeping your                                 dialogue positive this is about                                 resolving disputes effectively this is                                 about keeping you know being and keeping                                 with your code                                 conduct if you're working with a project                                 that doesn't have a code of conduct for                                 goodness sake please make one that's                                 part of keeping your store clean and                                 this is important not just in terms of                                 being welcoming to new folks but also                                 just creating a tone that makes it                                 useful for folks who have been around                                 long term to continue to feel                                 comfortable if your store isn't clean no                                 one's going to come in let alone come                                 back so part of this means don't let                                 things fester as you see an issue deal                                 with it if someone is dancing on the bar                                 in your restaurant is very drunk you                                 should probably take care of that                                 similarly if yet you see somebody                                 trolling you should probably deal with                                 that as well as someone that's just                                 really lost and they're probably gonna                                 need some help as well taking care of                                 things quickly also empowers other                                 people to be able to do this as well                                 because you're modeling for them you're                                 modeling that this is an okay thing this                                 is something that we do here if you see                                 something say something difficulties                                 also just don't impact with people                                 involved they have that ripple effect to                                 be able to carry out so                                 I think you should discuss the airing of                                 grievances because i have a berry                                 retreat um so the the other big thing is                                 being able to have a space where you can                                 air grievances where you have birds of a                                 feather sessions where you can bring up                                 things at big conferences where you can                                 have those conversations about things                                 that are challenging for you but also                                 where you can have an issue queue and                                 being able to have many different spaces                                 to be able to bring up as many things as                                 there are and get it resolved quickly                                 it's easy to be able to have a                                 conversation in person then it will be                                 online I think it's just how it is think                                 of this is your chance to either talk to                                 the store manager talk to your server                                 fill out the customer comment card how                                 many folks have ever worked on an open                                 source project it felt like they were                                 experiencing burnout ah excellent we                                 have all been there so core contributors                                 major leaders in every project are at                                 some point going to experience burnout                                 every human being at some point is going                                 to experience for now and so when we                                 talk about taking care of your regulars                                 when one of the things that we want to                                 focus on is being aware of the fact that                                 your most productive community members                                 are going to be your most likely targets                                 for burnout right okay that's so that                                 seems to my obvious right but you want                                 to make sure that your regulars your                                 core contributors your project leaders                                 you're incredibly enthusiastic                                 volunteers stay happy so how do you go                                 about taking care of your regulars they                                 these might also be your fussy eaters                                 sometimes and totally gonna be more                                 difficult to please but they're going to                                 be your heaviest tippers and their needs                                 can cause ripples they can you know                                 imagine the kitchen needing producing                                 not in the menu extra every single night                                 in the middle of your rush but again                                 there's some of your most productive                                 people so you balance their knees and                                 you have to be able to tell them when                                 their desires are going to need to be                                 able to take a backseat and if you've                                 already got a road map you can put that                                 on your road map and say hey I know that                                 we're not gonna be able to get to this                                 right now but we'll be able to work with                                 it later and again when you're dealing                                 with your regulars or core contributors                                 the folks in your product or most                                 productive you've already built a                                 rapport with them so having some of                                 those difficult conversations about you                                 know hey I'm sorry we can't really do                                 the things that you want us to do will                                 actually be                                 somewhat easier process but it's sticky                                 right it's difficult because sometimes                                 your regulars will feel like they're you                                 know their status in the community is                                 going to bring more to whatever it is                                 that they're proposing or whatever their                                 desire is that they're putting on the                                 table and it can be a real blow for them                                 to realize that being the awesome rock                                 star of the project is not enough to get                                 you to make these major Khan you know                                 major changes to whatever your we are                                 tearing this out and replacing it with                                 an entirely different issue queue                                 because I say so yes I have been                                 involved in that discussion no I do not                                 recommend it it is not fun well but at                                 the same time you also want to be able                                 to thank people in your community for                                 being able to come and do things as well                                 and I think in Drupal we do a really                                 good job of that because there's always                                 an opportunity to be able to contribute                                 more we give people opportunities to be                                 able to grow up the drupal ladder and                                 again this is another key thing to                                 realize particularly when you're dealing                                 with someone who may be experiencing                                 burnout it's really important to take a                                 temperature and realize when maybe an                                 investment has in a particular                                 individual or a particular customer has                                 gone bad right if your regulars are                                 awesome and demand a super extra special                                 chocolate souffle every time they come                                 in even in the middle of a rush maybe                                 not so bad when you tell them that                                 you're sorry that you can't make that                                 happen this evening because you have a                                 special private party but you'll be                                 happy to you know throw in a couple of                                 chocolate chip cookies for free and                                 their response is to stand up on the                                 table and start throwing silverware in                                 open source we call the safe way more                                 that's you know that's a great time to                                 you know suggest that maybe it would be                                 effective for us to take a deep breath                                 relax and chill out and if this becomes                                 a behavior pattern that you didn't see                                 before you've probably got someone who's                                 dealing with burnout it's totally fine                                 to take them aside and say you need a                                 break and you know come back when you're                                 feeling better well rested and when you                                 are no longer wishing to throw cutlery                                 so last but not least completing the                                 transaction you know and bottom line is                                 at the end of the day we all want to get                                 paid and that depends on your                                 motivations for being involved in the                                 open source community it may be that you                                 get a great deal of pleasure of                                 volunteering your time you may feel this                                 software is most useful for whatever                                 reason you want to contribute at the end                                 of the day everybody wants to actually                                 feel like they're getting something out                                 of what they're putting in and they want                                 to feel good about it so again talking                                 about you know making people feel                                 welcome when they get in pulling people                                 in is easy and making them stay as hard                                 and giving them the tools that they need                                 to be able to expand how they're going                                 to contribute recognizing the great                                 things people do and just even if it's                                 just a thank you in person it means a                                 lot and I know it sounds incredibly                                 counterintuitive but actually one of the                                 best ways to acknowledge contributions                                 is to ask people to do more I know we                                 talked about burnout just a second ago                                 and I think you and I need to do and                                 talk about balancing burnout oh come on                                 so actually making a specific ask of                                 people is incredible it shows that                                 you're paying attention to what they're                                 doing you've recognized what their skill                                 set is what they're interested in it                                 shows that you've really taken a                                 fundamental interest in them as a person                                 right this is the equivalent of walking                                 up to your regular patron who you know                                 absolutely adores fine chocolate and                                 saying we have this new chocolate                                 souffle that I think you're really going                                 to love why don't you taste it for us                                 and give some feedback to the chef that                                 would be really very much appreciated                                 similarly hey if you could help out on                                 this event because we saw that you did a                                 great job with this drupalcamp and we                                 could really use your expertise and say                                 public relations or we need to find some                                 food sponsors making that specific ask                                 if somebody a you're much more likely to                                 get a volunteer than if you just do a                                 wide call saying I need help with yada                                 yada it's really easy to ignore I need                                 help with yada yada and you're showing                                 that person that their contribution is                                 valued because you're asking them to do                                 it again and then the part about                                 volunteer management is sometimes being                                 able to split in the check just taking                                 that large gigantic undefined task and                                 throwing it at someone is just going to                                 it in pain you want to be able to break                                 it up into little bits and be able to                                 break that up into a place that                                 something's going to be able to run with                                 it and if they                                 and being prepared to even break it down                                 to smaller other bits that's the                                 volunteer management side of open source                                 community management so basically what                                 you don't want to do is have folks turn                                 up saying I'm ready to volunteer and                                 then you hand them something that has                                 you know                                                               you figure out who ate what we're                                 definitely items really it's just uh I                                 have this bag idea about a thing oh yeah                                 go do it I don't believe in vague ideas                                 about a thing all right I think this is                                 our favorite slide yeah so we've we've                                 talked a little bit about like being                                 able to do documentation and keeping up                                 with your project knell of it and how do                                 you do this without being overrun so um                                 speaking you know as a professional                                 community manager you will never have                                 enough hours in the day I think we all                                 understand completely what that's like                                 and that's okay the key to success here                                 is asking for help before you need it                                 how many of you have managed restaurants                                 okay awesome wait mission okay um so one                                 of the things that you do when you're                                 managing restaurant is you look around                                 and kind of look at your traffic flow                                 and you maintain an awareness of how                                 many folks are in your restaurant how                                 many tables you have open how much staff                                 you have on hand it's a really great                                 idea when you're at seventy-five percent                                 capacity you only have one server and                                 your dinner rush is starting in you know                                                                                                          up and see if they can take another                                 shift right if you wait until you have a                                 two-hour line out the door all of your                                 tables are full and you're wrong running                                 around giving folks you know I don't                                 know a sip of free beer because you want                                 them to stay and not feel like your                                 restaurant is crappy yeah then it's too                                 late the key to avoiding overwhelm when                                 doing community management is to ask for                                 help before you need it I think this was                                 called planning it is called planning it                                 is also called of wedding the small                                 dinosaurs of doom but they're really                                 cute I like the dinosaurs so thank you                                 and we welcome any and all questions                                 yeah good so quite a while ago I read an                                 article apparently a hundred years ago                                 they were really into motion studies and                                 and they went in like observe people                                 doing different kinds of jobs and what                                 not and the example they gave was like                                 bricklayer and they discovered that when                                 they got a hold of a you know a                                 brand-new bricklayer just coming out of                                 the job for the first time in learning                                 it they they noticed that what they                                 taught the new bricklayer to do was not                                 how an expert bricklayer laid bricks it                                 was like very wasteful inefficient you                                 know kind of brain damaged and so I                                 guess my question you know specifically                                 for Drupal is you know our is the way                                 that people are brought into the Drupal                                 community is it going to be the wasteful                                 brain-dead inefficient thing like you                                 know this is a field and drag this over                                 here I mean I know there are some people                                 out there who you know that's how they                                 approach computers but you know I                                 personally found like when the Macintosh                                 first came out I said wow this is a huge                                 step backwards you've taken this really                                 wonderful machine and made it really                                 hard to compute with because instead of                                 automating things more it automated them                                 less and so does the Drupal community                                 have like how to generate like real live                                 web sites quickly you know for someone                                 who's just getting into it as opposed to                                 like for instance there was a seminar                                 just yesterday which I thought was                                 really cool is like using Drudge to                                 rapidly like boom deploy websites so I                                 think my instantly is that your how many                                 ways like I'm hearing two things one how                                 many ways are there to be able to get                                 into the Drupal community and to                                 which one is the right one well I are                                 there I don't know I know which one's                                 the right one for me would be that like                                 like here's how to rapidly deploy a                                 website as opposed to here's how to                                 generate a pretend toy website that no                                 one really wants to use and then maybe                                 three months later you'll finally learn                                 all of the pieces that you need to do a                                 real website so i think that um just in                                 my experience with the general community                                 i am not a drupal developer nor do I                                 play one on TV but you know having                                 worked with many many different projects                                 I was consistently impressed with Drupal                                 because of the many different vectors on                                 entry that they gave to people so                                 everything from the Drupal dojo to                                 various videos and screencasts and tours                                 to barn raising events where you                                 literally sit folks down and say to them                                 this is a field we're going to build a                                 toy website this weekend so you get your                                 feet wet and I think that the great                                 thing about that is clearly we're all at                                 different places on the learning curve                                 we all have different interests and we                                 all have different learning styles and                                 accommodating all of those differences                                 it just makes the community stronger and                                 allows more people to be useful and                                 contribute and in the past four years                                 that's to expanded tremendously there's                                 been many many training programs that                                 have come up in many ways to be able to                                 let people in however they need to be                                 let in so at this point it's sort of                                 like if you don't find something that's                                 going to work for you just you know turn                                 around and do a                                                          a textbook or something that's come out                                 turn around and go find a video or go to                                  a meet up and sit down with someone and                                  say hey I've got this crazy idea for a                                  website and generally they'll be pretty                                  helpful in terms of being able to sit                                  down and say okay here's here's where                                  you're going wrong and here's where like                                  this is going to come back to bite you                                  that sort of thing thank you thank you                                  Yeah Yeah right away microphone please                                  because we're trying to record yeah they                                  gave you and then we're totally all                                  about you Jason sorry thanks for being                                  patient um you know I am new to the                                  Drupal community um welcome thank you I                                  have been being pulled into it for the                                  last couple of years by a friend of mine                                  who's very active but I found that when                                  I                                  came to drupal org and came into the                                  community it took me a very long time to                                  figure out how to get plugged in so I                                  thought it very interesting in your                                  opening thing about welcoming people                                  effectively strangely enough the example                                  that you showed really wasn't apropos                                  because I didn't know I exactly felt                                  what he felt I didn't know where to go                                  and I'm still finding out all the time                                  and it's so funny because I think the                                  tools are there but they're not being                                  marketed well enough so that people like                                  me can become brand evangelists and                                  again this is one of our challenges                                  appeal because we've seen it for so long                                  i'm like oh yeah i know exactly where                                  the getting started button is i'm                                  actually uh yes just one second and then                                  totally I'm actually very curious as to                                  if your friends been trying to get you                                  into doing drupal development for two                                  years like why there wasn't more of a                                  buddy system for you because i find that                                  folks you get pulled into brand new                                  projects that they don't necessarily                                  have an immediate interest in on their                                  own typically it's done because of                                  friends i mean that's why we all do all                                  kinds of fun things online like facebook                                  these are our friends so what in you                                  know what I'm just curious as to why                                  there wasn't more encouragement / this                                  is IRC / feel the love for you on it                                  really comes more from Who I am                                  personally I work okay I'm an                                  advertising agency so he said you have                                  gotta solve web this way you're an idiot                                  if you don't got it basically and so the                                  advertising agencies there are a whole                                  host of us that have no clue right the                                  functionality of Drupal and once we                                  figure it out it's like oh my gosh this                                  is awesome if it doesn't have to be                                  rocket science exactly yeah and I think                                  that that's one place we're working with                                  open source communities can be                                  incredibly difficult because if this is                                  a commercial entity they're going to                                  have a wonderful datasheet all about how                                  to use Drupal for someone in an                                  advertising agency right whereas for                                  open source communities were like code                                  it's awesome it will totally do                                  everything you want it slices it dices                                  and it will make your life better now go                                  figure it out on your own and come back                                  to us when you're ready and oh by the                                  way we're over here in IRC it's nice                                  here you'll like it yeah                                  and just to follow oh this is really                                  tall just to follow up on that I'm so                                  I'm a UX engineer so I know sort of how                                  the back end of most systems work but                                  like Python or to fuller peach you know                                  like that doesn't matter to me as much                                  as like the drag-and-drop experience and                                  all those things and it what excites me                                  about Drupal is you guys are going in                                  that direction in a really heavy way but                                  when i look to plug into the community                                  for that thing that it sounds like you                                  guys really need and need help with I                                  can't find where I should plug into that                                  in a non code based way like I can do                                  the code but it won't be as good as                                  someone who does that all the time but I                                  can tell you that it should do that so                                  in some ways I think groups and like                                  those kind of spaces are going to be                                  good for you also some of like the the                                  work that the initiatives is doing and                                  it's just going and looking paying                                  attention the way that I find that stuff                                  is honestly through core and looking at                                  like you know what's going on where yeah                                  and I think from dealing with a lot of                                  different CMS and just even like pylons                                  and those kind of communities it really                                  really sucks for everybody else like                                     x people we don't know where to plug                                  into any of them so if Drupal can do a                                  better job at that just overall many                                  buddies on that it would be great                                  because then we'll know where to go cuz                                  we don't necessarily like we show up at                                  these things when it's too late you know                                  sometimes so yes um so two things one                                  just in general for folks who are not                                  sure where to get plugged in who want to                                  help Drupal um if you use IRC is                                  everyone familiar with IRC or am I using                                  an acronym without expanding it and                                  being rude I'm going to take that as you                                  know what IRC is pound drupal dash                                  contribute that's where you can go and                                  hang out and I agree that's actually not                                  particularly well exposed on the site so                                  that's probably something worth pointing                                  out to folks and also in terms of you                                  know where do you plug in and how do you                                  get started a lot of folks are really                                  new to the dribble community if you've                                  looked at the statistics at the how much                                  drupalcon has grown over the years                                  trying to figure out how to radiate that                                  message to all the new folks who come                                  into the community is hard particularly                                  when you have a core group of very                                  experienced people for whom it is                                  completely obvious that you're going to                                  drop into drupal dash contribute on                                  freenode i mean why don't you know                                  that's where I am every day I auto join                                  when I sign                                  right so you know being willing to give                                  those consistent reminders about where                                  it's difficult to find that point of                                  entry is so useful because it allows                                  those of us who've got that ton of                                  experience and make a bunch of                                  assumptions and have forgotten all of                                  the stuff that is really important to                                  you because we just kind of do it                                  intuitively that's incredibly valuable                                  and thank you for the feedback go ahead                                  all right and just to add to that too I                                  think you know for people that have been                                  in the community for a while taking a                                  step back every now and then is very                                  beneficial because you're drinking the                                  kool-aid you've been doing it for so                                  long you forget what it's like to be a                                  new person coming in and so that might                                  be another thing to add so I've got two                                  questions first can you talk about the                                  maybe the hierarchy of community                                  management so with such a large                                  community like this the particular                                  example I'm thinking of is on the                                  group's dido you've got people that own                                  different topics and different different                                  drupal user groups and so you've got                                  people that do the community management                                  part but then you've got everyone doing                                  this kind of individual you know does                                  that make sense like the you talk about                                  the hierarchy I mean so the specific                                  example is that sometimes at least in                                  Drupal the group's tetrapod a dork area                                  you have people that are leaders of                                  certain areas they have signed up to be                                  people that will keep this particular                                  area clean it's not always true you can                                  sometimes wander into you know groups                                  that have been abandoned de spam some                                  time ago and that's like it it is a                                  rough hierarchy but the way that that's                                  generally worked as people that have                                  been willing to take that particular                                  topic on so it's not so much a hierarchy                                  as much as a stepping up to the plate                                  are key leadership not hierarchy about                                  leadership right use your presentation                                  show not it's definitely so my second                                  question is kind of more of a general                                  community management piece but what are                                  the tools that people can use to                                  effectively manage communities and so in                                  my mind I'm thinking at the stage what I                                  do robust first Commons I need like a                                  CRM system to keep track of all the                                  different people that I'm connected with                                  and to figure out hey i emailed                                  so-and-so last week and he just had a                                  kid so I gotta remind you know I got it                                  I'm almost like a sales guy right but                                  for the community and I'm                                  doing it for the community so what are                                  the tools that you guys have seen that                                  are great or that maybe need to be built                                  I'm gonna be completely useless to you                                  because I have this unbelievable                                  capacity to memorize random pieces of                                  data about human beings like the first                                  year I did summer of code I memorized                                  everyone's email address and their name                                  because of that and then I met random                                  people three years later and recited                                  their email address to them by rote and                                  they knew you were like wow you are                                  awesome and I thought I've got you                                  snowed so i don't think i can give you a                                  really good recommendation for a tool                                  there but maybe one of the things that                                  I've seen work really well and this is                                  coming from metafilter a while ago yeah                                  exactly Oh old school community and one                                  of the things that they use to be able                                  to keep things clean and this may or may                                  not help is just being able to look at                                  like something that was like a year old                                  that was suddenly getting a bunch of                                  comments that they had like a particular                                  flag for that they go and watch for like                                  that spam kind of thing and similarly                                  they built other dashboards inside to be                                  able to look at like you know a new user                                  that's just posted like eight things he                                  might be a spammer her there was sort of                                  like you know the the nitty-gritty tools                                  to be able to track what it is that you                                  need to be able to manage in your                                  community helps you get out of the way                                  to be able to remember those important                                  things like the that guy that guy that I                                  needed and I really need him if you have                                  the simple tools you can work on the                                  harder stuff and one of the other things                                  that I would just adjust is contacts                                  database put tags in it and another                                  important thing about being a community                                  manager is you're going to be a person                                  who's going out making a lot of requests                                  for people to do things and part of                                  being that good community manager is                                  remembering that you know somebody in                                  your community really loves you know                                  vegan cupcakes and when you happen to                                  accidentally run across a vegan cupcake                                  recipe on the Internet send it to him to                                  say I was thinking of you and that                                  creates value in your community it                                  creates a tremendous value and you can                                  either do that with tags and your brain                                  or tags in your contacts database go                                  ahead Amelia I'm the community manager                                  at node                                                               some people in the room may have heard                                  of before I don't know and but I'm new                                  to the job and I just heard it i also                                  have                                  in the Scandinavian community for a                                  while Danish and Swedish communities a                                  tool we use we find really interesting                                  sorry it's a plug but at one school that                                  has been really useful to us is powe do                                  and I say that because it's it's a long                                  time ago in its first light it was built                                  partially under opal so we try to focus                                  on open source tools for things like                                  that and the PO do guys are really easy                                  to call up and say look we need this                                  functionality specific to Drupal can you                                  develop something and they usually do                                  awesome and it's a free tool one other                                  comment I wanted to make was we talking                                  about getting communities involved two                                  things that we've done in the Danish                                  community to try to pull people in and                                  I've worked really well are we have                                  companies who work consulting companies                                  or drupal shops who sells services in                                  the community hold Drupal intro nights                                  where they they put their decoders up at                                  a panel or at a table and they serve                                  pizza and then they send out notes to                                  the local technical schools or whatever                                  people to come and it breaks down the                                  barrier so that people aren't concerned                                  about oh these guys are way too                                  technical I can't ask any questions                                  they're going to think I'm dumb because                                  i'm a noob so we take that completely                                  away put the guys down at the tea at the

 why I come to these conferences yeah                                  thank you I came in a little late so I                                  hope this wasn't already addressed in                                  your presentation but how do you deal                                  with someone that let's say they claim                                  to be a drupal developer and then in the                                  end they come to these help sessions                                  that you offer and all they're doing is                                  they're saying hey can you do this for                                  me can you do this for me can you do                                  this for me and they constantly come                                  back and they become and they represent                                  a different group and they come to rely                                  on that as a resource so they're the                                  person that's doing the work but they're                                  not how do you deal with that so in some                                  ways it's they're asking for free

                           that's country yes okay hey my name is                                  mike stewart                                  I helped organize stuff in LA for years                                  just a couple questions comments I found                                  of that the whole concept of community                                  management has been somewhat divisive in                                  LA and the concept of term and hierarchy                                  somebody else asked about hierarchy one                                  of the things that we've done can                                  organically is really push for the                                  organizers in La La's geographically                                  huge every we have                                                        so there's there's tons of activity                                  there but I found a lot of what was in                                  your session I came in a little bit late                                  so maybe I missed some key stuff but I                                  want one of my main questions is I found                                  a lot of what you guys were talking                                  about a little bit confusing just I the                                  way I organize stuff is I tend to try to                                  set a stage and let the community we're                                  on as much as possible very much like a                                  camp we try to be very organic just you                                  know this few organized just because we                                  need anybody who's done it realize                                  there's only a few key people that ever                                  step up and do tons of people will raise                                  their hand to volunteer you know one or                                  two will do and so blah blah blah                                  question um where's this conversation                                  going to continue so I how did it if                                  we've got more input more things to talk                                  about um so we will be monitoring on the                                  halls the Restless conference our slides                                  will be up but I'm more than happy to                                  talk to folks about community management

                         not really I'm findable up ms aime yeah                                  good there's also a community group on G                                  do it so drupal.org which used to be                                  more targeted towards people building                                  community sites but I've also seen a lot                                  of post going up lately about like                                  community management types                                  so I'm sure would be an acceptable topic                                  to follow up on there nothing I'm sorry                                  to answer the question about like you                                  know what we were thinking about it we                                  were focusing more around log online                                  community management less of the                                  individual meetup organizing thing so                                  that may have been where that that you                                  know fell and one other thing that i                                  would suggest in terms of you know where
