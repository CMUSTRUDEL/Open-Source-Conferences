Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: OPEN ACADEMY: A HIGHER EDUCATION DRUPAL PRODUCT FOR DEPARTMENTAL WEBSITES
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	The university department is at the center of academic life. All across higher education, tens of thousands of departments have organized themselves to teach courses and perform research. As it turns out, most departments need a website to promote their work and each of those websites is basically the same. Open Academy is an academic departmental website in a box. Built by Pantheon, Chapter Three, and the University of California at Berkeley, we have baked in critical functionality around departmental news, faculty profiles, publications and presentations, events and calendaring, courses, resources and links, video, social media, and degrees and programs. Out of the box, Open Academy lets a department get an amazing and extendible website. As a bonus, Open Academy was built entirely with the Panels module utilizing the In-Place-Editor, pane level fields override, style plugins, layout aware pane displays, and much more. Come see a best practice Panels Drupal Product. This session will be given by Matt Cheney (from Pantheon and Chapter Three) and Brian Wood (from the University of California at Berkeley).

Questions answered by this session: 
What should an academic departmental website look like?
How do you use Panels to make a killer product experience?
How do you design a flexible product?
What does an administration interface for a Drupal product look like?
How can higher education benefit from a standard Drupal product?

running a bad camp together at the UC                                Berkeley campus which is which is always                                a fun time every fall um about a year                                ago year and a half ago I found another                                company with josh and zac and David                                called Pantheon which is the best most                                magical Drupal platform on the planet                                and that's we're now in general Villa                                Billy today so the stuff i'll show you

combination                                of the work we have done with the                                universities and the platform to host                                really was something that brought Brian                                and I and a number of other people                                together to work really closely so a lot                                of what this presentation is about is                                about the work we're doing together to                                turn you know Berkeley into you know                                even

          Drupal at Berkeley although I guess                                campus technology services is probably                                also there and all that him sorta share                                our sort of where Berkeley is with                                Drupal and what all that looks like it                                thanks a lot matt so yeah my title at                                Berkeley is applications programmer I                                work for                                central technology services and I wanted                                to set the stage a little bit by talking                                about myself a little bit and my                                experience at Berkeley I've been there                                for nine years working for the cal bears                                and I've managed to keep it a secret                                that I'm descended from three generation                                of Stanford as in Stanford Cardinal                                women so go great grandma I wish I knew                                her and that I went to every Stanford                                home game during the Elway years any                                Broncos fans out here mmhmm yeah right                                Broncos and yeah I'm sorry this is my                                first drupalcon presentation I just need                                to get a couple things off my chest I'm                                still I'm still pretty upset about the                                                                                                        that so let's talk about Drupal I came                                to Drupal around                                                       and I was working in business                                administrative surfaces at Berkeley at                                that point and I took over a super                                insecure web application written by a                                student and in a weekend turned it into                                a Drupal site and demonstrated what                                could be done with Drupal and how                                quickly we could bring up sites and from                                there I started started on my path as a                                UC Berkeley Drupal evangelist and soon                                after that it it became pretty obvious                                to me that there weren't really good                                drupal hosting options at Berkeley so I                                took it upon myself to learn acre and                                get on slice those bring up some boom                                two VMs and demonstrate what could be                                done for a Drupal specific hosting                                solution at Berkeley I brought up a                                Berkeley site on that and was quickly                                told let's bring this back on site on to                                campus servers and so that was an                                interesting project moving to Red Hat                                Enterprise Linux and working without                                 full route and stuff like that but that                                 service is being retired right now and                                 the main reason was not technological                                 problems but it had to do with the                                 financial structure                                 berkeley we operate on recharge which                                 means that every hour of my time                                 translates into                                                        to be charged to a client so we were                                 quickly looking at monthly fees for a                                 simple Drupal site of north of six                                 hundred dollars and that simply wasn't                                 sustainable so we started looking into                                 outsourcing so before I get into how we                                 came to Pantheon a little but I just                                 want to take a step back and talk about                                 the state of things at Berkeley Drupal                                 is is definitely on the rise and has                                 been for a while we've got a lot of                                 enthusiasm on campus my colleague know                                 Noah Whitman here has manually catalogue                                                                                                          this is around fifty to sixty percent of                                 the Drupal sites under berkeley.edu and                                 we believe Drupal roughly serves twenty                                 five percent of departments research                                 labs museums libraries its                                 administrative units since we began our                                 relationship with Pantheon in                                 mid-november we have handed out                                     invite codes on Pantheon and my                                 department which does web application                                 development has seen frequent requests                                 for Drupal consulting bringing up you                                 cite

             people to view job standards and create                                 pre-populated job descriptions which is                                 a currently a vb.net app and we also

prettiness                                 of that is                                 thanks to help from femurs at chapter                                   we are riding a good wave of community                                 enthusiasm for the last number of years                                 we we have an active Berkeley Drupal                                 users group which I took the reins of                                 two years ago it's been happening                                 consistently since                                                    the public as well as UC Berkeley                                 employees into that and that's been a                                 great synergy we've really gotten a nice                                 transfer of knowledge from people                                 professionals working in the community                                 you know sometimes coming in and talking                                 about experiences they're having with                                 Drupal that are a little bit more                                 cutting-edge than some of the things                                 that that we're doing on campus we've                                 been experimenting with users helping                                 users drop in sessions once again with                                 public participation and we're trying to                                 channel some of this community online in                                 an upcoming drupal commons site that                                 we're going to bring up which hopefully                                 will provide a forum for people who are                                 using these different drupal based                                 products like open scholar like open                                 academy which we're going to be talking                                 about and interested in getting more                                 information interested in gaining some                                 assistance so let's drill down a little                                 bit and talk about the current situation                                 of Drupal development on campus so                                 difficult typical thing that we see is a                                 campus organization hires a consultant                                 consultant comes in and usually builds                                 them a pretty good Drupal site and then                                 says here's how you add your content and                                 takes off and this campus organization                                 is there on on their own for maintenance                                 and upgrades and and other things that                                 can come up as their Drupal site ages                                 we're also seeing a wide variety of                                 hosting solutions selected you know                                 everything from a legacy campus web farm                                 which for a while was lacking a PC and                                 some required PHP modules to are more                                 state-of-the-art campus virtualization                                 service which requires some amount of                                 sysadmin knowledge                                 to to keep a site going and and then a                                 whole slew of approved and unapproved                                 third-party shared hosting services does                                 this sound familiar to any of the                                 education people out there so you know                                 we're also as far as site development                                 goes we see in consistent use of                                 scheduled backups in consistent use of                                 version control spotty inflammation of                                 implementation of central authentication                                 and home-brewed themes which often don't                                 quite harmonize with the enterprise look                                 that Berkeley would like to be                                 presenting so um how do we solve these                                 problems we think we think the keys are                                 to outsource hosting and hopefully that                                 means selecting a standardized Best of                                 Breed hosting platform we want to                                 leverage install profiles and                                 distributions and use them to reduce                                 site development time we want to make                                 Drupal site building easier and we'll be                                 talking a lot about that as we go on                                 today and then it's also of course very                                 important to be complying with standards                                 which means campus procedures campus                                 standards and accessibility so multiple                                 hosting providers can help us solve some                                 of these remote multiple service                                 providers can help us solve these                                 problems and the owners of the Drupal                                 service have continued to be open to                                 multiple relationships but Pantheon was                                 an obvious first choice for us we're                                 impressed with their high performance                                 Drupal which incorporates press flow                                 varnish engine X and then we'd seen from                                 time to time these demonstrations of                                 open academy and we were wondering like                                 is it going to be as cool as they say                                 it's going to be and we got some money                                 freed up to fund some development of                                 that to really find out and so that's                                 the main thing we're going to be talking                                 about today in addition to this stuff                                 you know                                 as many of you may know pantheon                                 provides out-of-the-box dev test live                                 environments so right there you know we                                 educating our developers to not develop                                 on their live site is is a great step                                 they got they've recently introduced on                                 server development which allows our our                                 people to connect the SFTP or a secure                                 Arsene connection which is which is                                 familiar to them but they're not leaving                                 our power users out in the cold there's                                 still a great workflow for localhost                                 development and you know direct                                 interaction with get and then of course                                 it's all tied together by a web UI that                                 makes it easy to to migrate your code up                                 the stack dev tests live and migrate                                 your database and files down the stack                                 and do things according to best                                 practices we we've really enjoyed the                                 flexibility we found in pantheon I mean                                 they've got a great customer service                                 orientation customer centric centered                                 orientation is what I meant to say and                                 they've really been willing to                                 understand our needs we we have not felt                                 like we're either too small or too big a                                 customer for them which has been you                                 know a really nice experience and                                 together we found a lot of creative ways                                 to solve problems we we first started                                 talking with Pantheon early on about how                                 do we create these start States on but                                 what should we present to our users and                                 we in addition to open academy we                                 decided it's important to also give give                                 our people a vanilla Drupal                                           customized install profile so that they                                 don't feel like they're all like being                                 put in one box which might not be as                                 flexible as they'd like some of the fun                                 stuff has been we want to have some                                 control over some of the functionality                                 that's integrated into these into these                                 and small profiles and so we've worked                                 with with Matt and his colleagues on how                                 they're how they're leveraging apps                                 and we've brought up a UC Berkeley app                                 server that delivers things like a                                 solution for central authentication the                                 solution for mixed mode authentication                                 sites that need to have some people                                 coming in via cos and some people coming                                 in via Drupal standard off and a little                                 bit of glue that keeps people configured                                 correctly depending if they're in their                                 dev or live environments we want them to                                 be hitting our our dev ldap servers as                                 opposed to our production ldap server if                                 they're just testing on we've somewhat                                 we've taken a good step towards solving                                 the updates problem the site maintenance                                 problem in that one of the things that                                 you get with Pantheon is they will                                 you'll see get an alert on your                                 dashboard when there's a core update                                 available and a core update means not                                 only an update to Drupal Corbin an                                 update to quote-unquote core modules                                 that that work with open academy or that                                 work with the Berkeley install profile                                 so I wanted to take just a second and                                 talk a little bit about the little bit                                 of co-branding we've done and some some                                 other reasons that we we did it you know                                 in addition to simply letting people                                 know that they're using pantheon but                                 it's a Berkeley specific Pantheon                                 bringing up the subdomain Pantheon                                 berkeley.edu has allowed us to take some                                 of the load off our developers in terms                                 of setting up ssl we're using a subject                                 alternative name sort that has a                                 wild-card name in it that and this means                                 that when you bring up a dev site on                                 Pantheon basically assert is already                                 working and you can turn on secure pages                                 or you can turn on                                                    going prior to this you are required to                                 create your own certificate signing                                 request email our pki team and then have                                 them tell you you got it wrong and go                                 through it a few times and into and then                                 figure out where to put the key and that                                 and that's that's a lot task some of our                                 people who are just                                 developers and additionally the the sub                                 domain allows us to do a wild card                                 registration on our CAD server so calves                                 can be working out of the box as soon as                                 you bring up your dev site and and we're                                 excited about that because we're looking                                 at really making this default so that we                                 don't have people having to manage                                 accounts for people who have left the                                 university you know if they're if                                 they're going to be a central                                 authentication and they're removed from                                 our our systems they won't be able to                                 login to your Drupal site either after                                 they're gone and finally something we                                 get that's kind of in this category is                                 what i'm calling generically because it                                 has no real name yet berkeley users                                 management dashboard and this allows UC                                 berkeley to have some administrators who                                 can feel the launch requests from our                                 users a typical Pantheon user is ready                                 to bring their site live they will click                                 a button that says give us your credit                                 card and so we've got a different                                 situation set up for Berkeley users and                                 they have to jump through some                                 bureaucratic hoops fill out a web form                                 for us and then we can go in there and                                 say yeah you're ready to go live so                                 that's that's a nice workflow for us it                                 also provides us a report of you know                                 what a user is responsible for what dev                                 tests live domains and in the future                                 we're going to have some information                                 about security release status of all the                                 sites so when there is that you know                                 moderate to critical security release we                                 can quickly get a view of what sites are                                 affected who might need help here making                                 sure that we're in compliance so um I'll                                 just show you a couple of quick slides                                 in case you haven't seen pantheon                                 or that shows the user interface                                 basically when you create an account                                 this is where you land and you've got                                 you know options to download your drush                                 aliases and those will work remotely                                 from your desktop if you wish and a few                                 other things add your SS HP there's                                 other places where you can add team                                 members to your site and then once                                 you've done that you get to choose ok                                 what do you want to install and so for                                 the for Berkeley people will eventually                                 have options appear like UC Berkeley                                 Drupal                                                                  have our specific customizations to it                                 after you pass this screen we're into                                 the install profile and this is where a                                 lot of the Pantheon magic happens after                                 configure site you can see some of the                                 apps tough in gray which might be a                                 little bit hard to see in the back                                 that's happening you'll get to you'll                                 get more information from Matt as we go                                 through the demo on this we get the                                 panoply apps that that enable panels the                                 open academy apps and finally the apps                                 that come from the UC Berkeley app                                 server so with that let's dive into open                                 Academy and I'll turn it over to Matt                                 thanks Brian so yes and this is this is                                 all stuff you can do right now you can                                 go in your laptop sign up for a Pantheon                                 account and then you can dump in and                                 look at a lot of the same stuff that                                 we're looking at today so that could be                                 something to take home and play with but                                 what I really want to talk about is sort                                 of open academy where are the features                                 to it how does it work and then get into                                 a demo to show everyone some of the                                 magic that we've built I think the place                                 to start though is really sort of to                                 talk about why and sort of what the                                 larger goal of the of the project is I                                 think the the way to started as                                 universities have a lot of great content                                 and they have a lot of very smart people                                 and they have a lot of very bad websites                                 mmm and that's not a slight to the                                 people work there at all there's a lot                                 of every department as website every                                 faculty person can have a website every                                 research group every academic unit every                                 event I mean there's so many sites that                                 you need all the time and that there's a                                 million other things you need to be                                 doing                                 part of what open academy is striving to                                 do is to say look like let's make                                 spinning up sites easy and let's also                                 make spitting up sites and configuring                                 them not a task for developers something                                 that you can do as a you know as a                                 faculty member or staff person or                                 someone that doesn't have specific                                 Drupal skills because those are at high                                 demand and become very expensive and                                 tricky to do and so what we're really                                 trying to do with open academy is                                 essentially democratize a lot of this                                 technology make it so if you're a sort                                 of university department you don't have                                 to go out and drop you know twenty                                 thirty thousand dollars to get like a                                 whiz-bang site that you can have                                 something you know that's relatively                                 powerful that's customized to your needs                                 and if your university has a theme looks                                 like the way it should without having to                                 go that sort of custom route and I think                                 one of the really interesting stories                                 one of the things that motivates me sort                                 of strongest about this is is several                                 years ago when we were working at                                 chapter three doing university sites I                                 had this one very weird day where I got                                 a call from someone at Berkeley a                                 department that wanted a website we                                 talked for a while about the                                 requirements and a little bit about some                                 other ideas well put academies sort of                                 like bouncing around in my mind at that                                 point and you know we got the end of it                                 I'm like okay like you know whatever                                 like what do you know what's you know                                 what's your budget what does this look                                 like and they had a really low amount of                                 money because that's all they had you                                 know land grants school state                                 university-california isn't like you                                 know has some funding issues and you                                 know and that was really sad to me                                 because I'm like these people don't want                                 anything that's not different than other                                 people but they're sort of priced out of                                 this thing and then I got a call from                                 another university also and they had a                                 great deal more money and they had                                 actually five times as much money for                                 basically the same stuff and I'm like                                 that's actually really really unfair and                                 that's not like drupal should do that's                                 not what open source to do and so let's                                 try to build a Drupal product that                                 actually can be used by everyone so you                                 don't have to you know continually                                 reinvent the wheel every time you want                                 to have an event calendar or people                                 directory or a news feed or a list of                                 publications or or a list of courses on                                 your site so huh we started to build a                                 Drupal product it's a little hard to do                                 if anyone struggled through it you know                                 I guess we can empathize together I                                 think it's sort of a journey to get one                                 done a lot of that's because you know                                 this is new stuff like there's you know                                 a lot of the stuff you need to work on                                 this is you know only a few people have                                 done before the actual tools and                                 patterns are still in development                                 there's a lot of                                 agreement over how you know best that's                                 sort of do this for Drew blade as well                                 as just stuff you should use now there's                                 several solutions for the full content                                 several solutions for a number of other                                 things and that you know just getting                                                                                                 harmoniously with your custom stuff and                                 getting it all to like customizing code                                 without having to any configuration is a                                 really tricky task and you could spend a                                 lot of time just getting that to work                                 and that's not even talking about your                                 specific problem they'll try to build a                                 university site it's just to sort of                                 just to get it up and running so I                                 suffered through that that was the last                                 you know several months of my life and                                 now we have something really good I                                 think on a sort of higher picture level                                 to talk about sort of the philosophy                                 behind the product i mean i think the                                 the biggest difference you'll see with                                 what I'll show you versus maybe what                                 you've seen before is that the open                                 academy product is privileged akan tenth                                 creator and sort of the end user of the                                 website that it doesn't ask you to go                                 the drupal back end it doesn't ask you                                 to be a technical whiz to get things                                 done that everything is on the front end                                 everything has previews and you know is                                 really easy to use and looks a lot more                                 like something that you would probably                                 want Drupal to do than what it does does                                 today it's also something i think i want                                 you know in terms of a sort of access                                 and sort of a product it should be the                                 kind of thing that you can get a really                                 good website without having to customize                                 it and you can add new stuff obviously                                 but that it's something that I feel                                 everybody should have access to and                                 should have access to for for free I'm                                 populous done drupal org I believe in a                                 lot of that kind of stuff and so you can                                 go today you can download it you can run                                 it and have a great site and I think                                 also just in terms of longer vision like                                 getting Drupal to run twenty percent of                                 internet it's going to require this kind                                 of stuff yeah we're never going to get                                 types of the internet by paying custom                                 work for every site we need standard                                 solutions and university is a great                                 place to start because we all need like                                 hundreds of these things every time you                                 have a university we also built the                                 product way you can extend it and remix                                 it similar to how DJ's work just because                                 you know not everyone wants the same                                 thing you want to extend it and do it so                                 to get there technically there's a                                 little bit of back end and I won't go                                 too much in the Drupal sort of sort of                                 technical details of unhappy to talk                                 after or take questions but um the the                                 really the the strongest place to start                                 here is I think Drupal's great and the                                 controls are great but I think one thing                                 that's been missing in the Drupal                                 product space is really as sort of like                                 I don't know like operating system                                 layer maybe they're not the right way                                 but some sort of like standard set of                                 functionality that like will make Drupal                                 better than what Drupal core is for                                 example it's                                                          and Drupal to get one set ups actually a                                 little tricky and the get one really                                 tripped out is even trickier still and                                 so one of the things that we sort of                                 found really quickly what we were doing                                 is that we needed a sort of this base                                 layer which ultimately is called panoply                                 that'll actually provide a lot of the                                 standard stuff people really need they                                 need to have really cool faceted search                                 they need to have WYSIWYG you need to                                 have admin dashboard you need to have                                 you know a lot of this kind of                                 functionality and so let's just                                 standardized it and so if you were a                                 true Myles talked earlier in this room                                 he talked a little bit about this but we                                 sort of took that base stuff I just                                 talked about and then all of like the                                 panel's module magic that I know about                                 and that Earl knows about Sam Boyer                                 knows about and everyone I talked to                                 knows about and we rolled it all                                 together into this sort of base distro                                 so you go to drupal org now and get you                                 know project / monopoly and you can                                 download all this stuff doesn't have any                                 University stuff to it that's what open                                 academy does but it provides a sort of                                 base install and that's what open it                                 kind of uses to build all of its stuff                                 and I think other distributions can as                                 well and so you get some stuff you know                                 these are out of the box you get a bunch                                 of these features which I talked about                                 you get the genius of these people down                                 here and you get a bunch of the panel's                                 modules so panels panels i peep analyzer                                 fillable panel pains Kim existing pages                                 panels breadcrumbs pal layouts and a few                                 other things that will sort of be rolled                                 in and this I think is the future of                                 Drupal I think this is where drupal                                      going to go in terms of layout and                                 content management I think this is where                                 drupal products should go I've been                                 doing Drupal sites with panels for like                                 for many many years there's a great                                 audio only recording of me in the                                    year old version of me at bat camp in                                                                                                         the future of Drupal and I think it's                                 true and I think it's more sure now than                                 it was now I think it's more true for                                 products and it has ever been for that                                 it was for building sites but this is uh                                 this is very cool i'm very excited about                                 this and on a technical level you get a                                 bunch of stuff is it makes rupal for                                 everyone you just get the ability to                                 customize a page by hitting at the                                 bottom you get a bunch of layouts you                                 don't have to write any CSS to get and                                 they're all responsive to boot you get                                 to have an in-place editor that actually                                 looks pretty nice and will work to                                 actually change the way your site looks                                 so                                 and functions without having to go on                                 the backend write any code you get live                                 previews the things you're going to add                                 so you could actually see sort of what's                                 going on and you don't have to guess and                                 you get that WYSIWYG and an actual                                 content editing experience that that's a                                 little more straightforward for people                                 who aren't used to Drupal and and maybe                                 don't even know what they're using is                                 Drupal so that's panoply it's online                                 right now dribble research project phone                                 opoly and you can also it's on Pantheon                                 as well as an install and that's really                                 the base thank you and that's the base                                 base stuff for people our developers                                 presumably you know that panels advocate                                 that's that's a really big thing but for                                 open academy and for universities like                                 that's just a missing piece of                                 functionality that we need to build like                                 really intelligent like vertical                                 specific applications that we need to                                 say as University I want to develop                                 specific use cases that I need to have                                 functionality around I just needed that                                 base to do it so open academy i think is                                 a solution for university websites and                                 specifically it offers these features                                 that are allow people to really sort of                                 expand their site beyond standard or                                 drupal so the features we have right now                                 we have a people feature which is a                                 directory of individual profiles and the                                 ability for people to like you know                                 associate with various other items you                                 can list your publications or your                                 courses you teach on a site have the                                 ability have events you can have event                                 calendaring and individual events for                                 specific sort of tags or areas                                 publication lists that integrates with                                 biblio module so you can have really                                 strong citation support as well as some                                 good like promotional images and stuff                                 to show off some of the the academic                                 work that you've done there's a news                                 feature that looks a lot like a blog but                                 as you know it's sort of geared more                                 towards new announcements and there's                                 abilities to feature parts of it in the                                 system will show you and there's a                                 course directory that allows you to sort                                 of list the courses your department or                                 university offers and then associate                                 those other things as well all tied in                                 with this open academy core and this is                                 stuff i think everybody sort of needs                                 I've built this stuff like dozens of                                 times I think that as good as sort of                                 standardized it and really get people                                 working on sort of I what other things                                 do we need to expand on this these are                                 the first sort of five ish will sort of                                 app use cases there's another half dozen                                 plan and I'm deaf                                 be open to talking to people about other                                 stuff that you want we've got plans to a                                 media image gallery there's an FAQ app                                 that could be installed relatively                                 easily and there's a bunch of other                                 things that are being sort of sketched                                 out but these are also all done as apps                                 which if you're familiar with Drupal                                 sort of development practices features                                 is probably pretty common apps is sort                                 of an extension on top of features that                                 specifically will work with a remote app                                 server and that app server will like                                 sort of your updates and allow you to                                 use a Drupal core update manager to                                 download download them so actually if                                 you go through the install for open                                 academy this code you get initially                                 doesn't have like any of these things                                 you actually pick you're like I want the                                 news thing I want the events thing and                                 when something new pops up you go to                                 your dashboard it's like hey there's a                                 new faq app you can install it and I                                 think that's a cool way to like it's                                 still new but it's a cool way to to                                 manage Drupal sites and think for                                 universities it becomes really important                                 because you can easily throw in                                 additional apps and so Brian I mentioned                                 Berkeley has their own app server that                                 has the authentication module and some                                 other stuff and so you know you've had                                 this layering effect so you get your pen                                 opoly apps you get your open academy                                 apps and then you get your university                                 specific apps and that helps to make um                                 you know sort of a really easy to easy                                 to customize site you can customize your                                 functionality and you can also customize                                 your theme so one of the things that we                                 did a lot of work on with open academy                                 was figuring out how do you allow for                                 the theme to be overridden and how lao                                 people have their sort of custom look                                 and feel and the designer at chapter                                   nico Lorber who goes by nights lobster                                 on on twitter she has been really big of                                 an advocate of a template approach for                                 drupal design so she's got a blog post                                 where she lists out about                                          different Drupal elements every site                                 needs designed there's maybe another                                 dozen to open academy would require we                                 have a nice spreadsheet that outlines                                 them and the two base themes that we                                 give with open academy sort of lay all                                 those out and the sort of sort of big                                 vision here is that because panels                                 controls all the like content variable                                 in the middle of the page that all you                                 like to do to put a university side on                                 there is either a take your existing                                 University theme and just dump it on or                                 be just customize some header and footer                                 stuff in the in the in the theme and                                 then change a few the standard                                 drupal elements away you go and then you                                 can customize your site and you can                                 actually make it responsive relatively                                 easily because all of our layouts are                                 responsive all of our widgets are                                 responsive and if you have a header and                                 footer that is too you're good to go and                                 I think that's a really really big win                                 because having mobile access on campus                                 is increasingly a big deal and having it                                 sort of work with your content and                                 presentation layer not having to build a                                 separate thing for it is is a big is a                                 big saver of time and sort of just keeps                                 it all together which is great you'd                                 also obviously extend it so the apps i                                 talked about in the theme i talked about                                 um so you know in terms of really sort                                 of showing you off i think we can sort                                 of dive in and and do a live demo which                                 is always risky so i'll put that out                                 there but you know let's give it a shot                                 so um I gone through oh ok let me throw                                 sorry                                 okay so I've gone ahead and I've                                 actually spun this up on Pantheon                                 already you get a cool little dinosaur                                 at the end of this thing so you can sort                                 of see see what it is so that's the open                                 Academy source nika design that and it                                 stars your site and I've got here I                                 actual open Academy using the Berkeley                                 theme that the Berkeley communication                                 office designed and so this is what you                                 get out of the box that all I've done is                                 turned on the theme and you have you                                 know sort of access to a pretty and I                                 think good looking and kind of                                 reasonable University site and this is                                 something that you know we use the                                 default content module in Drupal to                                 provide default content so you can see                                 some pictures of some stuff I like and                                 some random vegan lips and text on the                                 site but it's good because it actually                                 gives people a sense of like what the                                 site is before they start one of                                 problems of Drupal if you've installed                                 it straight up is that it doesn't have                                 any things you don't know what it does                                 this sort of gives you that kind of                                 option which is great and so I can click                                 through and sort of show some you know                                 specific things so we've got our front                                 page obviously and we have a course                                 directory which you know has specific                                 courses that you can look at and they                                 just have information about through when                                 they are and who offers them there's a                                 news feed that um has a sort of fee no                                 featured news item that becomes                                 important for people if they want to                                 showcase something specific from their                                 larger feed and then they've got this                                 sort of standard kind of stuff each of                                 these things obviously gets into a you                                 know an actual design of a of a page                                 there's tag tag support which is pretty                                 important for news there's a people                                 directory that has a sort of list of                                 people that are categorized by certain                                 tags we give these by default but you                                 can change them there's an event system                                 that has a small mini calendar some                                 event types then a sort of list of                                 upcoming events this is you can change                                 this to a calendar which we can do later                                 if you want to see sort of a different                                 different take on that and then there's                                 a list of publications that has some                                 basic info about you know sort of who's                                 published it and some stuff like its                                 feature and that this is the kind of                                 like sort of general use case that I                                 think a lot of people have and I think                                 just getting going with this ely easily                                 out of the boxes it is a big win for                                 people and that our sort of assumption                                 is you'll spin up a site you'll get                                 something like this and then                                 you'll start customizing it and then you                                 can have your site so some other stuff                                 that I think would be really sort of                                 neat to sort of point out is that we                                 also because we're you know running on                                 Pantheon and have some Apache Solr                                 configuration which would work anywhere                                 we have a sort of search interface I can                                 search for for water which I know shows                                 up a few times and we actually get a                                 sort of faceted search experience that's                                 that's driven this way that's powered by                                 the panoply search but it's cool because                                 if you don't have epilepsy solar it just                                 falls back to the normal Drupal search                                 so it's sort of as a pretty seamless                                 kind of transition which i think is                                 useful and it gives people sort of leg                                 up there's also a admin dashboard that                                 um that gets you a lot of functionality                                 for your site this as far as I can tell                                 the only actual admin page you should                                 ever have to go to and this is part of                                 the philosophy here so this is our admin                                 dashboard it takes a bunch of gin                                 lamptons total control module and it                                 sort of lays it out a little you know                                 sort of little tighter and in that sort                                 of theme with the apps but it gives you                                 sort of here quick links to actually                                 install new pieces of content so this is                                 all the content we have and we have                                 little links to add them we can also see                                 see all of them that's a sort of content                                 management screen or configure them if                                 we have that permission we have the                                 ability to sort of manage our our                                 categories so we can for example I think                                 for academic term we add a number of                                 like common sort of term like fall                                 spring summer you know mid semester kind                                 of things but you can obviously change                                 that if you're on a different you know                                 trimester system of something different                                 say for event types tags and things like                                 that and that all uses the taxonomy                                 system obviously I ability to customize                                 the menus we just took we just actually                                 expose the menus that are actually                                 pretty useful header footer and uh and                                 the main menu the other ones are sort of                                 hidden and then customize the users and                                 then most of the other stuff you get is                                 just sort of interaction with the theme                                 in the apps and that these are the                                 things that you would need to customize                                 to make your site but other than that                                 you're sort of good so the theme I can                                 sort of pop up has a bunch of theme                                 settings this is default in the Berkeley                                 the Berkeley theme but it'll pull up any                                 theme settings for anything and we added                                 some stuff here for people to sort of                                 customized you know the name of the                                 University                                 copyright information some social media                                 links and other things and that's a you                                 type that in at install as well but you                                 can customize it later and that's what                                 power is the sort of bottom and the                                 footer in the header of the site then                                 each of the apps also has specific                                 configuration right now the only                                 configuration they actually have is the                                 ability to disable the demo content but                                 eventually will add more sort of feature                                 flags here so you can sort of choose                                 maybe it install do you want to have a                                 calendar that's like a monthly view or                                 weekly view or a list or or whatever and                                 actually make some decisions that which                                 is nice so let's go ahead and i'll go                                 ahead and sort of show you the just                                 maybe the content editing experience                                 because i feel this is really sort of a                                 central part of what what a lot of                                 people need to do with their site and                                 the place i'll start sort of to show you                                 that is um is a use case we're working                                 with the Department of Political Science                                 they have a sort of gender to study site                                 that they're putting up and they                                 basically need these five things and                                 then they also need to be a concept of                                 working groups for their site because                                 they've got a number of working groups                                 at the University it's a pretty common                                 case and so the way that we sort of                                 would support them is to allow them to                                 actually just go create specific pages                                 for each other working groups so I can                                 also add content this way so go ad my                                 basic page and now I get here so I'll go                                 all working groups I've also taken here                                 this is the path auto module that does                                 automatic generation of URLs usually                                 it's hidden down in the field set                                 somewhere as sort of tricky to customize                                 we've really privileged it and put it at                                 the top so people can have real full                                 access to that and then we have a                                 WYSIWYG here that ends up being pretty                                 powerful so this is a main page for our                                 working groups um for those who have                                 used wordpress this might be pretty                                  familiar to you like exactly the same                                  buttons um it's tiny MCE which i think                                  is a great editor I don't have strong                                  ideological opinions on that but it's                                  what WordPress uses and I think it's a                                  pretty standard solution and I think                                  that this layout ends up being it's                                  pretty well battle tested for                                  individuals content editing experiences                                  it also has this neat little kitchen                                  sink plug in that'll actually store it                                  in a cookie but a decision so if you are                                  someone who loves to have I don't know                                  the ability to colorize your text like I                                  do                                  you can have that exposed otherwise you                                  can hide it you also that we also have                                  pretty slick integration with the media                                  module so I can bring that up and I can                                  go back to my library of images and                                  decide actually add one of these so this                                  is my mother she can put this will get                                  this guy out here and that vid this                                  media module it's we're running on the                                  to the                                                                   really where a lot of the action is but                                  I think it's a great solution it does                                  video it does images and I think it's                                  really as for the consensus decision                                  moving forward so this is uh so yes I                                  built this up the other thing is if you                                  don't like WYSIWYG if you like HTML                                  there's a little toggle down here you                                  can actually go to HTML and that'll spit                                  out the HTML for the page if there's                                  media it's got some special stuff but                                  you can sort of see for the for the                                  coloring it just put in the markup here                                  and this actually is using the market                                  down editor which is a separate editor                                  with a better formats which is it and so                                  I can decide to actually use these kind                                  of buttons to continually customize the                                  HTML and this is something that                                  hopefully people can sort of use this                                  way to say we're not going to lock you                                  out the HTML we're going to provide a                                  sane default which is the WYSIWYG so                                  there's also the ability adds a feature                                  image and some other stuff here but i'll                                  go ahead and put this in the menu which                                  sort of makes this all happen and i'll                                  call this working groups and open menu                                  all right cool so now I've got in the                                  working groups I've got a I got a bit                                  here and that will just add a couple                                  more of these things just to sort of                                  show you sort of how this all this stuff                                  would work so go ahead and we'll add                                  another basic page we also used a pretty                                  cool module called menu block which has                                  a panel option which is why we use it to                                  actually build the whole sub menu so                                  we'll see we have this sort of a working                                  group                                            and you can't obviously customize the                                  HTML whatever you want working group                                    and then I can start to actually like by                                  building out my main menu I can start to                                  actually customize sort of the tree of                                  this stuff so if I go back to working                                  groups I start to have a list on the on                                  the left side that actually some sort of                                  little tree my content it'll go several                                  layers deep which is very cool and it's                                  the kind of thing that like people can                                  really I think sort of used to build our                                  site it will produce general content and                                  that is just I think just a nice sort of                                  sort of easy feature so let's get a                                  little more like cool and crazy so the                                  other really awesome thing this is what                                  panoply does and this is where I think                                  really the future of this dribble can go                                  with a lot of this layout stuff is to                                  say I want to change this page this                                  content isn't what I want I want to                                  change and add some stuff and I want to                                  do that now without doing development so                                  I showed you all the admin screen is                                  going to show you everything else here                                  is on the front end and everything else                                  sort of comes for these two buttons so I                                  can first show you the layout button                                  that's probably the easiest so this is a                                  this is a page it has a layout as you                                  can see if I wanted to change the layout                                  i can just click here and i get all the                                  layouts that i already have defined in                                  panoply so there's                                                       and you can see the one that's been                                  selected but I go ahead and just change                                  that and I get the cool panels bit too                                  to rearrange them and I save and now                                  I've actually changed the layout right                                  here and there and that's something that                                  I think is actually really hard to do in                                  Drupal normally like to write this in                                  code is a fair bit of work and even to                                  do it in panels on the backend can be a                                  little tricky this will override it for                                  just this page we also use a penalize                                  module or so you can do this for any                                  individual node no problem and that's                                  pretty cool because people want                                  different layouts for different things                                  you also have the ability if we go back                                  to the the main site to em you can also                                  add your own layouts this standard                                  candles layout plugins and every one you                                  get will show up there and now you have                                  even more flexibility we also have the                                  ability to style the site in the front                                  end so Berkeley's got a few colors gold                                  and blue that are a big deal to them and                                  so if we actually bring up the ipe by                                  customizing it we got this kind of                                  interface this is in the latest version                                  of panels                                                              you'll install it and if you customize                                  your page you end up you know have this                                  ability to sort of move stuff around as                                  you will but you also get the ability to                                  change the style so if I bring up my                                  style changer I can see here on the                                  right I have a preview of my content and                                  on the Left I have some style settings                                  so there's this blue header we can add                                  and that'll make my you know header blue                                  I can also make it gold and I can also                                  make it have this cool background blue                                  call-out style I think it's the best so                                  we'll go ahead and save that and now                                  I've actually sort of customized the                                  style of my sight without having to                                  really write any CSS or even define CSS                                  properties and that's something that is                                  easy to extend we obviously identified a                                  few cases and berkeley's needs that like                                  has for their styles but every                                  University has a style palette you could                                  implement a few of these panels style                                  plugins and you can do this so we can go                                  ahead and just sort of you know get a                                  little crazy down here you know change                                  it up maybe we make this one gold check                                  it out make this one also gold and then                                  the latest want the end blue all right                                  there also is a very cool module in                                  panels called style Iser which we're not                                  using the battle will allow you actually                                  to like on-the-fly custom create your                                  own style so you can actually pick the                                  the the fonts and the colors and all of                                  that other stuff which i think is a very                                  cool cool way to go so yeah so we've got                                  a site it looks you know generally what                                  we want but we can change it obviously                                  let's do more stuff so one of the things                                  we can also do is we can configure                                  individual pains by just sort of going                                  to the configuration options so I can                                  look at this recent news bit hit                                  customize and it will bring the up a                                  similar stream from before but now I'm                                  talking not about style but I'm talking                                  about content which is an important                                  difference and you can see I've made                                  some decisions here you know recent news                                  there's two items but I can easily go                                  ahead and change this so loops I can do                                  three let's say and i'll update that                                  preview and now i have a third option or                                  maybe i do want to show the tags i think                                  that's helpful but i don't really want                                  to show the body and i can do this and                                  this gives me the ability to really sort                                  of you know play with my content and and                                  have a really good time of it i don't                                  have to                                  worried about you know going into the                                  views to configure I don't have to worry                                  about writing theme functions to do it I                                  can just sort of pick what I want and                                  that this is something that's really                                  sickly innervated with the views module                                  these are all just used field you add                                  more you get the ability to customize                                  and we show it off right there so I go                                  ahead and save that that also works for                                  things that are a little more for the                                  node views this is a node view right                                  here so if I customize that node view I                                  get a similar-looking screen but instead                                  of picking the fields on it I can                                  actually pick the View mode so this is                                  the featured style as a special view                                  mode we have an open academy but i can                                  also show the standard drupal teaser or                                  if I was so inclined the full content                                  and that becomes really cool because you                                  can now like i can add an ode to a page                                  and have that ability to just show it                                  full and not have to worry about so                                  what's going on just very nice so we'll                                  save that um more stuff the other thing                                  that we have is what we can do is to a                                  this will go back to our working groups                                  page and I can sort of sort of change                                  this up so we'll go to our working group                                  page and this is a node it's a a pad                                  just a basic page note it comes with two                                  Napoli pages but because it's a analyzed                                  we can go ahead and use panel eyes or                                  customize it so I can customize this                                  page and I can actually add custom                                  content to this page without having to                                  UM without having to override all of                                  them are going to the back end so let's                                  say this working group maybe is very                                  interested in events so i can bring up                                  my ad screen and i have a new custom                                  design for my ad content modal this is                                  um i think it slightly more aggressive                                  style but it allows for a little sort of                                  cleaner experience and I can actually                                  for each of the apps that i have i have                                  the ability to sort of see live previews                                  of the different things that i can add                                  so there's some courses here's the                                  events yeah i got you know a calendar a                                  bigger calendar a sidebar a list of all                                  news the same thing through is for the                                  actual for news items and people and                                  publications have exactly the same and                                  this is something that i think is nice                                  because you can really sort of see what                                  you get before you get it and then you                                  can you make decisions that way and if                                  you add more things you add more panel                                  pain so just show up here and you can                                  have them so i'll go ahead and add a lot                                  of sidebar of upcoming events to this                                  page                                  and then we go ahead and pick some stuff                                  so let's see we will pick we don't want                                  two dates we are all for date and time                                  to be separate so we'll have that and                                  let's not show the body because the                                  picture is enough to attract people to                                  our event and then we'll maybe just have                                  just the upcoming two events ok cool so                                  ok so now we have our upcoming events in                                  the sidebar and this is just for this                                  working group page if I was to go to the                                  main page it doesn't have any of these                                  things it's just customized for just                                  this one I also have the ability                                  obviously to change the layout of this                                  page so maybe I want to get a little                                  more fun with it and i'll go ahead and                                  do do this one and sidebar content that                                  looks fine but now I have this item at                                  the top just save ok cool oh that looks                                  the same sorry all right we'll do a                                  better layout let's go through the right                                  side ok and so I mean this is like this                                  is the kind of experience to that if                                  like you're working as like an I a                                  person or like a designer or someone in                                  content strategy like these are the kind                                  of things that actually pro typing it                                  becomes really fun because you can have                                  the ability to decide hey I want to um                                  you know try out this thing and then see                                  how it looks or you know try another                                  thing and show it to someone else and                                  see how they do it the other piece that                                  then becomes really important and this                                  is where I think we really merge a lot                                  of the really cool stuff and Drupal                                    into panels is this module called feel                                  double panel pains and it will demo this                                  earlier but the way it works is that you                                  would for each of these little widgets                                  down here these are custom things that                                  we created as part of kenapa lee widgets                                  there are sort of generic pieces of sort                                  of I guess a framework so this this this                                  links is actually using the link module                                  to expose a special field you got to                                  file an image text you can have a map                                  table video spotlight or submenu and                                  that these are things that just sort of                                  sort of work on the box so I'll go ahead                                  and add some quick links this is                                  something that we see a lot people on a                                  university site want to have a bunch of                                  links to things off site or commonly                                  referenced items that they have so I can                                  go ahead and do I'll do quick links and                                  i'll make a link                                  may go in for drupalcon org and then                                  because I made it a multiple select                                  field I also have the ability i can link                                  back to drupal and i can also link one                                  to berkeley as well i also at the bottom                                  here sort of small but i have the                                  ability to make this reusable so if i                                  wanted to just put it on just this page                                  i could just hit finish and i would do                                  this or i could decide to say this is                                  sort of you know quick links and i'll                                  make it reusable so i'll say that maybe                                  put it at the top and then so now i have                                  my links up here but if i was to go in                                  let's say say say that and now i go back                                  to the homepage and decide okay well                                  maybe i want to add those up here i can                                  just remove that that help text which                                  isn't that helpful now that I've got the                                  product and I can actually now see the                                  links that i have and i can add those to                                  the page and that becomes really helpful                                  because now I can start to build a                                  library of things that I really like and                                  I have been all the ability to to you                                  know I can style this one that you                                  whatever way I want and I can also then                                  customize it any way I want and there's                                  a little warning if you customize it                                  it'll say hey if you edit this field                                  it'll change everywhere but that's sort                                  of what you want so that seems really                                  cool and useful and then I'll work for                                  for quick links will also work we could                                  do images so all I can go ahead and add                                  an image here just to show you how that                                  works I got some pictures of my                                  brother's graduation so I'll add that                                  here and i can upload an image as cool                                  because it works in this the CTools                                  modal and I won't make this I won't make                                  this one reusable cuz it'll maybe on the                                  homepage and so now i have i have my um                                  my image right there which is political                                  and this is the kind of thing and this                                  is kind of experience i think that                                  people really want when they're talking                                  about building websites because i don't                                  want to have to go like write a bunch of                                  code and format a bunch of images and                                  like do a lot of the sort of like                                  technical work to get this done they                                  just want to be able to upload the image                                  they want and have it fit in the content                                  area and also be smart enough so that if                                  i wanted to for example move it into                                  another content area that it would                                  actually be able to expand or can or                                  contract in size                                  and that that's really helpful um I                                  could also sort of play around with sort                                  of customizing it if I don't like what I                                  see go back the other thing that I think                                  has been really I found really useful in                                  university space or the spotlight pieces                                  of functionality I assume a lot of you                                  have this on your site where you want to                                  have series of images and some text and                                  links really sort of showcase various                                  things you're working on that's actually                                  to do that in Drupal there's a lot of                                  ways to do it there's a few modules                                  they're pretty good solutions but they                                  require require some technical expertise                                  to get working you've got to build two                                  nodes and put them in a view and we're a                                  node q to like order then it just sort                                  of takes Drupal site building experience                                  to do which for site builders is no                                  problem but for an end-user I want                                  something a little more straightforward                                  so one of the things that we added as a                                  sort of we made a new entity called                                  spotlight and if you actually add a                                  spotlight to the to the page it'll                                  actually give you the ability so you                                  could say my spotlight and you could                                  actually sort of fill out a title link                                  image and description and you could add                                  as many as you want so if we go look at                                  this one right here we can see I've                                  actually got these things in here and                                  this becomes really straightforward                                  because I don't say I want to promote                                  the lecture series it's the first one                                  you know this is just a question of                                  moving it up to the top if I want to                                  change the image it's just a question of                                  removing the image and adding it or                                  changing the text tool links and I've                                  done all this without going the back end                                  and this thing of course has that same                                  property it can make it reusable so I                                  could use in other pages as well and you                                  know otherwise I feel like there's um                                  there's a bunch of like sort of                                  additional stuff you can do here there's                                  um a lot of controls that I found for a                                  best-of-breed for people and there's a                                  lot of specific sort of admin experience                                  improvements throughout the product it's                                  in ten opoly it's an open academy and                                  that I you know it has a lot of that                                  kind of magic so I'll go back to this                                  and actually and you can try this right                                  now this is not something that's some                                  and you can download off Drupal to org                                  or you can go to Pantheon to get it and                                  here are the links to do that so it's                                  available right now in project / open                                  academy and you can go to Pantheon and                                  download it and I do hope you all will                                  check it out we're definitely interested                                  taking questions if people want to come                                  to the micro                                  phone we have a five five or so minutes                                  left and we're happy to stay here or go                                  otherwise to talk but thank you for                                  listening we hope you like this and try                                  it out whenever you have time yes first                                  question earlier you mentioned                                  integration with Commons can you                                  describe how maybe something like an                                  Events Calendar would work with open                                  Academy integration with Commons what I                                  would I was talking about was a                                  completely separate site as a completely                                  separate Drupal common site that we were                                  just throwing up to kind of do community                                  support around for instance people using                                  open academy and then wondering oh how                                  do I do that cool thing that I saw in                                  Matt's demo so so we don't there there's                                  no integration built built in the the                                  stuff though that is really helpful for                                  events I think will be is definitely on                                  the road map for functionalities better                                  integration with external feeds so like                                  that event calendar we said default                                  content up which helps you see it a lot                                  of universities have standard event                                  calendars they could use to actually                                  import import data from their stuff and                                  so maybe part of the install as they                                  give this and give us an XML or an ical                                  feed and we'll import your data for you                                  and then you could get that you can                                  import that same feed to drupal commons                                  or export it out of drupal comments to                                  have tight integration we've done just a                                  little bit of leg work around that like                                  with the Berkeley events calendar and                                  sort of breaking up the possible feeds                                  that are there and and it possibly at                                  some point just offering you know you                                  want all the lecture feeds they're all                                  the feeds by the Graduate assembly or                                  something like that okay next question                                  two questions at first as if there's any                                  workflow type functionality built into                                  open academy like does it include                                  workbench or anything like that it                                  doesn't include it in any workflow                                  functionality right now but it's it's                                  pretty we designed it I think the Drupal                                  way so it's pretty easy to extend and                                  you can add your revision or workflow                                  tool of choice to it the second question                                  is more about how you've done this at                                  Berkeley in terms of the sort of goofy                                  federated nature of most universities I                                  mean it sounds like you're running this                                  out of the                                  communications arm of the University is                                  that correct yeah the communications arm                                  is the owner of the service and and I I                                  actually reside in the technical central                                  technology arm and then are you guys                                  providing the service for free to every                                  department that wants to use it the                                  department's actually do pay a fee and                                  and we do some specific campus billing                                  based on we use chartstring so you know                                  we don't use credit cards and basically                                  we are offering our users the same                                  prices that anyone would get going to                                  pantheon that's how it works for us i                                  think it's radically different you know                                  depending what institution you're                                  talking to and is it a totally an opt-in                                  thing for your departments or you do you                                  have a mandate that's moving people                                  towards a standard no certainly mandates                                  do not go over well at berkeley we're                                  really famous for protests and stuff                                  like that so yeah completely opt-in and                                  and we're trying to you know once again                                  like there's open academy there's also                                  this more generic install profile so                                  we're we're really trying to give people                                  options the best we can thank you yeah                                  next up um i guess my question is is                                  during the the content module where you                                  know you're you're clicking it and it's                                  providing dummy content yeah when you                                  disable it does it delete all the                                  content yeah so the default contents run                                  with the default content module that has                                  sort of machine names or you IDs for                                  each one so you can turn it on and in                                  turn if you turn it off it'll actually                                  all go away but you could add additional                                  news posts for example then when you hit                                  disable content it doesn't it will just                                  delete the ones that are default and                                  won't delete your contract it's it's                                  smart like that and one last question on                                  the events module do you guys have are                                  you guys doing anything with the entity                                  registrations or anything as far as                                  registering for events no but when you                                  do use a calendar module and there's an                                  event type and so you could you could                                  attach a registration a bit to that no                                  problem yes next                                  similar to the workflow question I'm a                                  little new can we differentiate between                                  IT staff versus communication staff                                  versus the faculty and then the end user                                  in terms of like a permissions to the                                  the type of editor used for instance Oh                                  following table access locking down to                                  just CSS and not HTML oh yeah so the way                                  it works now is we do have a secure                                  input filter on the WYSIWYG so we're                                  only letting stuff through that's been                                  approved so cross-site scripting and                                  other kinds of vulnerabilities wouldn't                                  be possible on it would be though we're                                  using the better formats module and                                  WYSIWYG um to actually manage different                                  profiles so you could set up several                                  different user roles and have people                                  with like the ability to upload images                                  or not and that would be totally fine                                  and supported as part of sort of you'd                                  have to do as an extension but it would                                  be easy to do and table editing for                                  instance turn on or off that sort of                                  thing yeah the table editing isn't in                                  the woodsy rig right now we do have this                                  the ability to add a table filled entity                                  like in the as part of like the add                                  content so that was a sort of decision                                  not to put it in but I think if enough                                  people are interested in it it'd be easy                                  enough to implement I'm in the WYSIWYG                                  or you know you could extend that by                                  turning on that button in the WYSIWYG                                  profile you have be sure to talk into                                  the mic two questions the first do you                                  have any type of blogging capabilities                                  as we sit there we have it we have a                                  news feed and that news feed could be                                  used sort of as a blog but it's a sort                                  of central voice it doesn't have                                  individual people on it although it'd be                                  straightforward enough to add a field                                  add the author name to one of the fields                                  and you could customize to add that to                                  the post if you wanted okay and the                                  second question is are there plans on                                  interfacing this with some type of                                  learning management system or on                                  intranet um I think there's there's                                  definitely some interest in that I think                                  there's a there's a learning medicine                                  called Elms that's very cool out of Penn                                  State and I think that there might be                                  ways to sort of share information or                                  user accounts and then obviously open                                  atrium is a great in internet solution                                  as well dribble dribble Commons the same                                  but I think the I think the integration                                  point we're trying to                                  most heavily for is on the on the data                                  level so doing feed exchanges and like                                  single sign-on and stuff and try to keep                                  the functionality here relatively basic                                  so you can extend it as you want thank                                  you is really cool it's really                                  interesting that does provide the app                                  server the ability to charge for the app                                  is that something that you guys are                                  planning on doing or thinking about I                                  think it's Berkeley charged for the apps                                  that repeat a small truffle on a and                                  there's a bit of a misconception at                                  around apps and app server and yes it is                                  similar to what you know the iphone and                                  android store uses but in drupal if                                  you're using an app server it doesn't                                  necessarily mean you have to pay for                                  something it depends on who's running                                  the app server and obviously all of us                                  are really interested in making                                  functionality available to everyone so                                  we don't plan to charge wraps our next                                  question thank you very much for the                                  presentation actually I saw open public                                  but this is what I was waiting to see                                  thank you i will have three quick                                  questions first is can you hear me can                                  you hear me um i think it's a little                                  nice to speak up a little bit speak                                  really close put your lips almost on it                                  okay so the first one is what was the                                  module that you could customize the                                  panels like that fill out the footer                                  bottom that's the panel's ite module it                                  ships with panels and the interfaces in                                  the latest version                                                        it on and then in your panel you have to                                  make it an IP but then that's a we get                                  that functionality okay thank you                                  another one is dunno a module that with                                  the law actually customizing college                                  note styles but colors of those tiles ah                                  yeah you could do integration with the                                  color module to do some of the panel                                  stylings and some other may be in for                                  the whole theme if you wanted we haven't                                  gone that deep down in terms of that                                  kind of appearance stuff but it would be                                  you know certainly a possibility so                                  there's no module available you know not                                  right now okay and the third one is what                                  would you suggest to use for students                                  registration on depends on the nature of                                  the registration workflow and how that                                  would work but you could certainly                                  there's plenty of like                                  sign up modules and other types of                                  things you could attach to the event                                  nodes or even to the you know specific                                  author notes on the site that could work                                  for that but that's not that's not on                                  the road maps difficult for this nope                                  yeah okay okay but enough people want it                                  could totally be a thing and you can                                  make it's really easy to extend the out                                  stuff you could just copy whatever                                  existing apps and you get it make your                                  own registration app mm-hmm that's                                  really differently thank you sir um                                  maybe maybe I'll take one more question                                  and then we'll be available sort up here                                  for for other stuff I had two good                                  questions one is related to content                                  sharing and sometimes you have people                                  that span multiple interrelated sites or                                  news or events and how you guys handle                                  that was the first question um the way                                  so the quad dealing with sort of spam                                  right now that all there's no like sort                                  of user-generated content you'd have to                                  be logged in to do that and the accounts                                  require Administration approval so it'd                                  be sort of your people obviously we'd be                                  interested in extending it to the                                  comment module but we have to evaluate                                  the different solutions in terms of                                  what's possible for that but right now                                  you have to have an account to post                                  content and we assume those people are                                  trusted I was thinking more like if you                                  have say a department site then you post                                  some news and you want to bubble that up                                  to the faculty sites or something                                  something to that effect oh so you don't                                  want to like duplicate it is the oh I                                  mean I think that's just a question of                                  like how you're presenting it on which                                  site and how you set up some of your                                  like SEO rules and and what that looks                                  like but some people want it duplicated                                  they want the department news on the                                  department site as well as on the main                                  like News Service I do want to duplicate                                  it I just don't want to enter it twice                                  oh yeah sure then just there's a the                                  news feed comes with an RSS RSS feeds                                  you could just take that and pull it                                  into your main news site have at have                                  best of both worlds and the second                                  question was about data integration so                                  almost universities will have already                                  the list of courses that somebody's                                  teaching in some system already yep so                                  you don't necessarily want to enter that                                  into Drupal over again is there have you                                  done anything as far as pulling in lists                                  of people and courses yeah so Bryan sent                                  some great work actually on the event                                  stuff at Berkeley to get that sort of a                                  good path for that and longer term we                                  sort of want to support the ability to                                  have use the feeds module to pull an                                  external data feeds to populate the                                  content and that would be part of the                                  install especially if you're looking to                                  do it at a university you                                  like many sites on the university to                                  have that kind of capability you build                                  it once naked a nap as your custom                                  University happen and then you can                                  import data and that's something that                                  we're that's definitely sort of high on
