Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: THE FUTURE OF DRUPAL GOVERNANCE
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	Presentation is at lb.cm/governance and the related blog series at randyfay.com/topics/governance Governance basically means the processes by which we make decisions, make plans, and solve problems. Drupal has always (and admirably) had a very light touch in the area of governance, due to our light-touch founder and Benevolent Dictator for Life, Dries. For core development decision making we aim for consensus and Dries is the final arbiter. We have a great community, and this has definitely worked for the community. But...
From Wikipedia: Governance is the act of governing. It relates to decisions that define expectations, grant power, or verify performance. It consists of either a separate process or part of management or leadership processes.
But... our community is much more than Drupal Core development. And we have many, many issues of decision making, problem solving, and conflict resolution that should never, ever have to clutter Dries' brain. In fact they couldn't. We're a worldwide community with a huge number of participants and a gigantic level of initiatives. But we have no method of dealing with those except a lightly-defined "Consensus" model. This Core Conversation is about Drupal's governance structure. We'll touch on:
What governance is.
How other open source communities manage themselves.
Drupal's current governance structure.
Problems with Drupal's current governance structure.
Options for the future.
Risks of mucking with our governance.
If you are an advocate of forking Drupal, replacing Dries, or changing the BDFL model of leadership, please propose your own core conversation. The intent of this conversation is to discuss fleshing out governance in the Drupal world in areas where there is currently no effective decisionmaking/problemsolving/conflict resolution structure. It is not to challenge Dries authority. This isn't a radical session, but rather a very practical one: What should be the future of decision making and problem/conflict resolution within the Drupal Community?

	                              so what I want to do is first go through                               how many of you have read the the blog                               series that I've been kind of working on                               about okay you I'm just I'm going to go                               through some of that material because I                               think it's a good starting place and                               then we're going to get to what the                               issues are right now in the Drupal                               community and just kind of walk through                                those and your your input is very                                welcome and then I'd like to do a little                                brainstorming about what what you think                                we should do and I'd like to come out                                with some concrete some concrete ideas                                of how we can how we can build going                                forward in other words what I'd like to                                have be the outcome of this today is not                                we're not going to design Drupal's new                                governance today that's not I'd like to                                come out with a concrete plan though                                that would put into place something that                                would help us to build more structure                                into our governance that is in line with                                our culture so I would like to come out                                with a concrete plan and I think we can                                do that in this in this time that we                                have a plan to build a plan kind of                                thing right so what's that planning to                                plan yeah just and we can bike shed                                about this today but a no smoking crater                                that's right so the the actual                                presentation is hidden by this little                                slide thing here but it's lbc m /                                governance and that is writable right                                now by everybody so if you see                                especially as we get to the end if you                                see something that we need to add to                                that you're welcome to but you probably                                don't have to because Melissa agreed to                                scribe so she'll be adding to that as as                                necessary especially those later slides                                where we try to write down what we're                                thinking                                as a group so okay so I have always                                avoided kitten slides but now I am one                                right you know is it they were just too                                good so I I just want to say that no                                matter what problems we might have the                                idea that open source communities are                                able to create incredible things through                                voluntary collaboration of people all                                over the world is absolutely astonishing                                and it has to be one of the greatest                                things to happen in this world in the                                last                                                                  that in the newspaper does that go up                                there with Iran and nuclear threats and                                stuff like that I mean it is as                                important as Iran and nuclear threats on                                the opposite side and you're involved in                                that and that is absolutely fantastic I                                don't think that anybody should take for                                granted the idea that we are already                                collaborating and doing beautiful things                                I want us to do it better but we're                                already doing beautiful things in all                                these other communities are also doing                                great things so if you don't know what                                governance is it's just a fancy word for                                how we make decisions how we organize                                ourselves how we plan together how we                                make a decision when we make a plan and                                of course how we resolve conflicts and                                if you know anything about government in                                the country type sense you know that                                governance as an institution only worked                                as well as the culture behind it works                                and if you that in your own country you                                have probably seen some issues with that                                in the United States we have these                                culture wars that have brought our                                government to to a halt it's a very                                disturbing kind of thing but culture and                                the formal structures of governance have                                to go together and so as we think                                through these things we always have to                                keep the culture in mind                                the governance is just an afterthought                                if the culture isn't working so I know                                that we all value our we all value our                                culture and we'll all be thinking that                                way but that is a critical critical idea                                so culture plus process governess lets                                us have some consistency some idea of                                what's going to happen when and why it                                might happen that way lets us accomplish                                shared objectives lets us resolve                                conflicts and do things more efficiently                                I think that we can just keep going                                 forward so I put down a list as I was                                 studying various open source communities                                 of some of the distinctives that they                                 have and how they work each one has its                                 own culture and of course we all know                                 how we value ours some of them have a                                 membership concept so we don't have that                                 but debian and a boon to have a very                                 very specific membership step where you                                 become a member debian has a developer                                 step beyond that which is the commit                                 privilege kind of step which is very                                 interesting a lot of cultures have a                                 bender who has kept the dictator role if                                 you laugh when I say benevolent dictator                                 for life which many people do when they                                 first hear that it's actually just a                                 kind of a standard statement you know                                 it's like it's already it's something                                 that's used widely in the open source                                 world some of these have a sponsoring                                 commercial entity which we don't or at                                 least we claim we don't and some of them                                 have really defined structure and                                 leadership and some of them have nearly                                 nothing so we'll just take a quick look                                 at some of them debian is absolutely                                 amazing because if you read their many                                 government governance documents the                                 first thing they say is like nobody can                                 make you do anything so there                                 that's like the first line of the                                 Constitution is like you know it                                 basically says nobody can make you do                                 anything if you don't want to do                                 anything you don't have to do anything                                 but don't be in anybody else's way is                                 what it basically says but it's like wow                                 okay and so then they go on and they                                 have this enormously structured                                 governance that goes into great depth                                 and that seems to work pretty well they                                 have a social contract they have a                                 philosophy of open software they have a                                 constitution they have positions and                                 they have elected leaders you probably                                 can't see this very well but it gives                                 you some idea of the hierarchy and who                                 makes whom they have a project leader                                 who is elected who's not there forever                                 that it gets elected every I don't know                                 how often they have they have teams and                                 secretaries and just it's it's just                                 fascinating it's very very impressive                                 KDE which is smallish has not a it                                 they're like us kind of except that we                                 have dreams but they basically have just                                 do it it they have a rule we have some                                 rules you know like we call ourselves a                                 duoc recy they'd probably call                                 themselves that too they have a rule                                 that says that if you're doing the work                                 you get to make the decisions and that                                 is a that there's smaller community and                                 they do occasionally have deadlock like                                 we occasionally have but they have no                                 way out of it they have one committee                                 whose job is if somebody gets really mad                                 there there's a an attempted conflict                                 resolution and that's that's about it if                                 you go looking for governance on the KDE                                 site you'll find about as much as if                                 you're looking for governance on the                                 Drupal site you just won't I probably                                 mentioned that I searched the internet                                 for Drupal governance and all I found                                 was this thing at Drupal myths calm                                 that denied the Drupal had little                                 governance and and that does have                                 something to do with the word governance                                 not being necessarily the word that's                                 used in all cases where we're talking                                 about governance but it's still pretty                                 funny you know it's like the only thing                                 you can find is something that denies                                 that you don't have an issue with that                                 kind of thing wikipedia which you can                                 think of easily as an open source                                 community it's just that the source is                                 content is has it been a violent                                 dictator for life but interestingly                                 enough even though he's like this super                                 Thunder founder guy his his prerogatives                                 have been limited over the years and of                                 course they have quite an amazingly                                 large community and his role and it has                                 been occasionally controversial but they                                 have they he or they or something have                                 actually rolled back in with specifics                                 what he has the power to do and he still                                 has an impressive set of roles but it's                                 it's it's very interesting to see that                                 they have a constitution but their big                                 thing is solving solving conflicts at                                 the page level because have you guys                                 ever seen one of those big conflicts on                                 wikipedia where you know like the george                                 bush page or something like that where                                 everybody has a different opinion and                                 they have to sort it out they've got                                 that down to it they've got that                                 particular issue of governance sorted                                 out to where they have the technology to                                 do it on the talk page next to it and                                 they have the procedures to do it I just                                 think it's very impressive that they've                                 worked that out at that level lubuntu                                 has very very impressive level of                                 governance and of course we and KDE                                 and everybody else you can think of have                                 snarfed their well-thought-out code of                                 conduct so the boon to code of conduct                                 with minor changes becomes the drupal                                 code of conduct except that we don't                                 have any of the structures that they use                                 to resolve conflicts and that sort of                                 thing so we punt on that part they have                                 a benevolent dictator they have a                                 commercial sponsor like a lot of the                                 communities they have a you know a lot                                 of people will say about WordPress or                                 about a boon to oh it's all about                                 canonical or oh it's all about automatic                                 it's absolutely not true as far as I can                                 tell in either case both of them are                                 very established very functional and I                                 would imagine also dysfunctional open                                 source communities but they both seem                                 from a casual glance from the outside to                                 be very very functional well thought out                                 and real open source communities not                                 puppets for some sponsoring commercial                                 organization so I think I've heard that                                 many times said about wordpress org but                                 as I read about them and watch their                                 videos and stuff I don't think it's true                                 I think that they are a very established                                 open source community ubuntu has the                                 membership concept it has community                                 manager Joe no bacon who's one of the                                 very widely well thought of thinkers in                                 the governance and community and                                 community organizing view that whole                                 world there he has a book by the way and                                 there's the reference to the book it's                                 free book the reference is on the blog                                 posts his book is well worth reading and                                 there's a chapter a full chapter on                                 governance and a full chapter on                                 conflict resolution that are very well                                 informed very well thought out who boond                                 to has specific conflict resolution                                 because they have a way to do it they                                 have a technical committee they can make                                 technical decisions and they have a some                                 kind of a community committee that can                                 make community decisions                                 and solve those kind of things WordPress                                 has a sponsoring commercial entity has a                                 real community and has a very has a very                                 specific org chart with lieutenants and                                 that sort of thing and it has a you know                                 if you've been around Drupal for very                                 long you know the trees has a very very                                 light touch and that's one of the                                 characteristics of our community and and                                 I think it's a I think it's a defining                                 thing that is a part of why our                                 community is what it is I think it's a                                 beautiful thing matt mullenweg is very                                 explicit about directing he's very                                 directive he says this is what we're                                 doing gift to it and they basically they                                 say to new contributors hey you know                                 like if you don't like what Matt wants                                 to do you might want to go to some other                                 community which is a perfectly                                 reasonable thing to say but a very                                 different style than Drupal and of                                 course the linux kernel is a nut is the                                 most famous of all open source                                 communities but it's kind of a narrow                                 kind of thing like i don't think that i                                 could get a patch into linux kernel                                 without working on it for a few years                                 you know you get yourself into there has                                 anybody done any work on the kernel that                                 would it how did it work                                 so so just to get a fix in that's                                 obvious was that it was clear how to do                                 it but it's like patches in a in a                                 mailing list stuff like that you know                                 it's it's very different from our huge                                 community with lots and lots of people                                 and I get the impression it's more                                 vertical most of the work you know                                 especially features ok so then there's                                 us and we're we're a lot like some of                                 the others we have a benevolent dictator                                 we have a tradition of gentle leadership                                 or or cat herding only leadership                                 sometimes where we have leadership a lot                                 of times it's only rather than leading                                 it's grouping or trying to get people to                                 do things or that kind of thing we have                                 the new initiative lead experiment which                                 is a great new step in core development                                 where we have some lieutenants what five                                 five lieutenants some we have some                                 lieutenants who have some kind of                                 leadership invested in them and we don't                                 exactly know what at this point but                                 there is some kind of leadership                                 invested in them are we have words that                                 we use like consensus and like duoc recy                                 that are very important but can mean a                                 whole bunch of different things                                 consensus can mean that anybody can                                 block any issue it can also mean that                                 you can do something if nobody's looking                                 a duoc recy can mean the very very                                 empowering sense of if something needs                                 to be done I can go do it which is very                                 powerful it's a it's a it's a wonderful                                 thing it's a suckered me into quite a                                 number of problems                                 like this one yeah because I can propose                                 a cork conversation and and poke at our                                 governance structure and I think it's                                 important here I am we have the Drupal                                 code of conduct which says a lot about                                 our culture but has no teeth because we                                 don't have much governance structure so                                 it's kind of a it was a trial balloon                                 and it stayed up and it's there at                                 drupal.org / DC OC and it's the same as                                 Ubuntu's except that we don't have                                 really any way to institutionalize what                                 it says we don't have any conflict                                 resolution model at all there are a few                                 people who try to solve problems our                                 most famous one is in the front row on                                 my left ah quia is not it is explicitly                                 names itself as not a sponsoring                                 commercial organization and that's                                 probably a matter of you know it should                                 be conversed but I don't know whether I                                 don't think it probably has to do with                                 this conversation today but it obviously                                 drees with Drees with his agenda as                                 project lead and Drees with money at his                                 disposal in the office of the CTO                                 probably has a specific power that                                 nobody else has and that doesn't need to                                 be viewed badly and the drupal                                 association a lot of people think that                                 the drupal association is Drupal's                                 Constitution or governance or whatever                                 but it's just not true the drupal                                 association does have governance itself                                 but it is in charge of money and it's in                                 charge of events that's it right well                                 that's money right money because of only                                 infrastructure as it has to do with                                 money so so the drupal association can                                 affect the                                 rupal community by where it puts money                                 that's that's very similar to AA quia                                 because aqua gets to choose where it                                 puts money it can have an impact on the                                 community but it so that the drupal                                 association is drupal association is not                                 Drupal it is not the community it is not                                 the development community none of that                                 so that that's a little hard to sort out                                 I mean it was only like last year that I                                 realized that so yeah yeah Joseph so the                                 question is does the does the DA control                                 like our actual drupal org or the                                 associate that I'm only in so much as                                 they fund the servers and and they put                                 some funding into the care for the                                 servers and they put some funding into                                 new initiatives so yes they could turn                                 it off by not paying for it but                                 essentially know if they got weird we                                 would just figure out a way and it'd be                                 gone you know I'd be off of their out of                                 their world so if the DA got                                 dysfunctional and started saying hey                                 Drupal you better do thus and such well                                 the community can just change my if it's                                 not likely to happen so but it's I'm                                 speaking to right yeah you you want to                                 say something you say just on the topic                                 of the drupal association because i'm on                                 the board of the drupal association so                                 the drupal association explicitly and                                 it's like constitutional review call it                                 does not control the project does not                                 control the community does not do any of                                 that stuff we try and just basically                                 handle the things that have to be                                 handled by an infrastructure or an                                 organization with money um you know like                                 drupalcon is really hard to get a bunch                                 of scrappy developers together and like                                 let's just pool our money together and                                 get like eight hundred thousand dollars                                 and throw this huge event sorry I'm                                 sorry yes so we you know we basically                                 try and limit the powers of the DA                                 around                                 the things that the community can't                                 rally around and do themselves and in                                 terms of drupal.org I have a talk                                 tomorrow about that and it's where we're                                 edging our way into like helping                                 drupal.org more because this is what                                 we're hearing from the community that                                 they want more support but definitely                                 not a we control the project kind of                                 thing at all we pay for the servers but                                 there is a huge infrastructure team of                                 like                                                                   that stuff and we fund certain                                 initiatives like the get migration the                                 drupal redesign again things that can't                                 be sort of done to a grassroots                                 mechanism so thank you very much okay so                                 before we look at some of the oopsies                                 about drupal's governance situation                                 right now we need to acknowledge what is                                 absolutely fantastic and I mean we're                                 all here because it's absolutely                                 fantastic we have you know like like I                                 was saying it's duoc recy you have this                                 pre-emptive power vested in you that if                                 you can just figure out how things work                                 you can just do it as we said before                                 it's worked a long time we have a great                                 community and we have this Apple jency                                 appointed out in the comments on of the                                 blog post so we have this culture of                                 peer review that that we should never                                 lose whether or not we add structure the                                 peer review is great power and of course                                 multiple minds working on something can                                 mean designed by committee but it can                                 also be fantastic in resolving things in                                 a wonderful way by people collaborating                                 really actually truly collaborating so                                 now I do have a list of problems as                                 you might have guessed that I would as                                 with any place where everybody can do                                 their own thing we can often have a lack                                 of and by the way you're welcome to add                                 to this list and we'll just add to it                                 there can be a real lack of strategic                                 focus focus as the kind of person who                                 gets suckered into just working on what                                 he sees is a problem I used to do that                                 in core a lot every time I'd come to a                                 bug or a thing that I didn't like how it                                 worked I would take that on and I would                                 open an issue and I try to make a patch                                 and all that kind of thing well is that                                 strategic know it can it be useful yeah                                 it can be useful but it is no way                                 strategic and everybody working on what                                 they think is the thing is not strategic                                 the lack of predictability for                                 contributors just thinking in the same                                 context this isn't just true of core                                 development but okay so i would take on                                 those core issues and you know hack at                                 them and it could take a year to get a                                 single stupid thing in because you got                                 to get somebody to pay attention to it                                 you've got to get it reviewed nobody                                 else might care you just have all these                                 people often work on projects especially                                 in core development for a really long                                 time and then either they finally get it                                 in and they're exhausted or it still                                 sits there so I have plenty of issues                                 that are just sitting out there that                                 just finally got ignored and that's a                                 terrible thing for us to waste that                                 there's so another critical problem is                                 the problem that we have when what we                                 call consensus doesn't happen we have a                                 very poorly defined idea of consensus                                 and it includes anybody who shows up                                 can block progress and that isn't a very                                 productive model so we have a list of                                 bad things that happen when consensus                                 doesn't come around we can have nothing                                 happen at all we can just stop we have                                 feelings hurt and contributors leaving                                 the field that happens fairly regularly                                 we have people wasting their energy and                                 then we have the absolute ultimate web                                 chick named smoking crater syndrome                                 where the feelings just get too high in                                 the issue and nobody wants to stay and                                 and therefore again nothing gets done                                 which I think I think one of the                                 critical things that we absolutely have                                 to do is when we have a problem in our                                 community that needs to be solved we                                 need to solve it and not abandon the                                 field because our model of dealing with                                 it isn't adequate we need we need to                                 actually solve those things of course we                                 don't have a conflict resolution                                 methodology which is the same thing I                                 already said wasted energy and the loss                                 of the loss of important people because                                 of the the heat so just to say a little                                 bit about my own personal experience                                 which I've I already have I got here a                                 kind of by accident it's a duoc recy I                                 was I was talking about burnout at the                                 last drupalcon and thinking about the                                 causes of burnout and what what causes                                 us to just burn through contributors it                                 I think it's our perception that Drupal                                 is worse about that than some other                                 situations we've been around it may or                                 may not be but the the comments that                                 came out of that session at London                                 included the fact that people spend too                                 much time related things that we can't                                 solve problems that we can't enable                                 people adequately that people end up too                                 scattered                                 and that people who are willing to give                                 end up being asked to give too much                                 those are all governance as well as                                 culture issues and so that started                                 pushing me toward thinking about                                 governance as it relates to our burnout                                 syndrome or culture the second thing                                 that happened was this fall I got                                 involved in a couple of conflict                                 resolution mediator type situations and                                 those are always satisfying on the one                                 hand because if you're successful then                                 people aren't mad anymore and some of us                                 are very sensitive to people being mad                                 and we really would like them nothing                                 but they're probably things that could                                 have been resolved by simple governance                                 structures that would already have                                 worked in our culture and not need an                                 intervention from you know from a                                 mediator type of thing plus the mediator                                 in the concept like that has no way                                 there is no governance structure there                                 is no conflict resolution methodology so                                 if you fail you fail and there's no you                                 know there's no place to go from there                                 yeah do you feel free to use the mic                                 because it's a that way people will be                                 able to hear it I am forest monster on                                 drupal.org Randy when you say that we                                 need to solve problems when they arise                                 does that mean not abandoning them                                 because I guess sometimes with some                                 problems you just let it go and they go                                 away can you tell me more about I mean I                                 don't know I just later maybe even                                 comment on that we need to solve all the                                 problems and so yeah so there are that I                                 mean that's a great question i mean is                                 it totally legitimate to just let a                                 problem exists yeah I mean yeah the                                 problem the thing that I'm concerned                                 about is that we have a culture that can                                 walk away from problems that must be                                 solved                                 okay not all problems must be solved I'm                                 worried about the ones that must be                                 solved and we have lots of them and a                                 lot of times we don't get them solved                                 because of this this whole thing yeah                                 yeah you betcha okay so we don't have                                 much support infrastructure in the                                 Drupal world we started out with forums                                 because Drupal itself has forums and we                                 have a few people who carefully                                 maintained the forums but essentially                                 people who come new to the Drupal world                                 have a really difficult time finding an                                 organized level of support there are a                                 number of solutions to that probably but                                 due to the level of conversation and                                 stuff it's been a very long time and we                                 haven't been able to even punt and like                                 say okay well stack excision just doing                                 a good job let them do it kind of thing                                 so that that's an example another                                 example would be the would be the full                                 project application process we want want                                 want to have new developers in our                                 community we want to make it easy for                                 them to get in and we want to instruct                                 them on the way in but the only                                 structure that we've ever come up with                                 is unsustainable and we haven't been                                 able to make a decision that would make                                 that sustainable because we're just                                 basically like this and so we haven't                                 gotten it even though we talked and                                 talked and talked at every drupalcon we                                 have a talk about it and we try to solve                                 it but we haven't actually solved it we                                 have                                                                     like that so those are a couple of                                 examples yeah                                 so right now number two points that                                 Jeremy just made Jay Thorson who is like                                 the man who is trying for a technical                                 solution to this problem and has been                                 and it's how he got sucked into many                                 many wonderful things boy that the two                                 things that Jeremy said was that notice                                 that there's no plan stated publicly to                                 talk about that at this drupalcon oh                                 dear okay which is another one of those                                 we're not dealing with it because we                                 couldn't which basically means we're                                 telling everybody we don't want you                                 implicitly so so those are some those                                 are some examples so those good enough                                 examples so yeah yeah okay alright so we                                 do have risks of change and we have to                                 take the change seriously we have to we                                 have to work this through and be aware                                 because our culture is a value to us and                                 governess doesn't like get better just                                 because you just because you wanted to                                 it's got to work with your culture so we                                 could offend people with increased                                 formalization we could have full bike                                 shits about formalization I'm sure we                                 could formalization or increase process                                 however you would want to say it I                                 actually am not thinking that we need                                 that much in the way of formality I just                                 think we need a little structure and I                                 think we can we can do a lot with that                                 some people might become passive you                                 know the day and they will take care of                                 it kind of problem so we have a duoc                                 recei and right now if people get                                 involved in the community and they start                                 to realize that they can just take over                                 space they do I'm actually not sure that                                 we have to do anything about that either                                 I think I think we might be able to just                                 leave that our problem is where                                 people try to take something over and                                 they can't so for example if we had                                 probably had we not blocked the new                                 Prada full project application and if we                                 said to like if we said to Jeremy look                                 we're failing just solve it then we                                 would probably have a solution you know                                 his his solution is a technical solution                                 that got blocked on some things but you                                 know like if you said to me just solve                                 it I would write I would just say okay                                 for now we're letting everybody in and                                 and I'd probably put a little bit of                                 social structure on that but that's you                                 know I would just say until we have a                                 technical solution we will increase our                                 training level and will let everybody in                                 but I can't do it the way we're set up                                 so in other words I don't think we need                                 to get rid of the duoc recei I think our                                 problem is when we block the duoc recei                                 which I had never really stated that                                 very clearly before our problem I think                                 is when we block the duoc recei so in                                 the two examples that I just said there                                 are at least two reasonable proposals                                 that would deal with the support issue                                 perhaps and and there they would work in                                 a duoc recei the problem is they don't                                 work where we where we block them so so                                 yeah so we don't want too much process                                 we don't want Oh epple gent is about to                                 speak we bow down Sutton so I just                                 wanted to give I think those are great                                 examples where where you know formulas                                 come a little closer into the mark I                                 think those were great examples where                                 formalization and empowering people to                                 make decisions would would empower                                 democracy rather than blocking democracy                                 the cat one counterexample is I think                                 you know the initiative lead structure                                 that we in it's an experiment right but                                 the initiative lead structure one of the                                 unintended negative side effects from it                                 has been that a lot of people have felt                                 like oh there's an initiative lead in                                 charge of that I don't have to get                                 involved so and we're trying to figure                                 out how to deal with that now                                 okay so so alex is saying that when we                                 have Lou added lieutenants were kind of                                 letting the lieutenant's do the work                                 which is a which is essentially that                                 that's the whole thing of they will take                                 care of it so yeah Angie in addition to                                 that what you said you don't think they                                 will take care of it is that big of a                                 problem but you noticed also that the                                 conflict resolute or for our community                                 was sitting on your left I don't                                 actually want that responsibility and I                                 don't actually want to be involved in                                 the center of every conflict and                                 everything trying to make people hug I                                 mean I have many other things conflicts                                 of your own I know I do and sometimes                                 I'm in the middle of the complex and                                 that makes me really in a really bad                                 position so you know i'm not against                                 formalization because you know about                                 that i think it'd be great if we had i                                 think our number one thing is you you                                 nailed it it's we don't have a conflict                                 conflict resolution is literally to do                                 right this later pretty much the second                                 thing though another negative                                 consequence of the the formalization of                                 initial bees that we know has happened                                 is um in drupal                                                       that all had direct access to Driessen I                                 I mean you know give or take there were                                 definitely some more equal than others                                 based on their level of contribution but                                 essentially you know I could probably                                 name four or five hundred of those                                 thousand that I you know oh yeah that's                                 the person you know formalizing                                 initiative leads which was kind of our                                 first experiment with you know putting                                 some structure around quarter bone                                 beyond like just identifying maintain                                 errs and maintainer so text was you know                                 really a scaling drees problem it was                                 like geez wants these things to happen                                 he's going to appoint some people to                                 like go figure it out and I trust you                                 and then you know kind of that was the                                 theory right but the negative                                 consequence of that is a lot of the core                                 developers who are not good at cat                                 hurting and are not really somebody that                                 you want in charge of like helping other                                 people on board and stuff like that                                 because they're much better just like                                 crank out code they felt really                                 disempowered by that and they felt                                 really threatened by that and they felt                                 really like that there's been I mean we                                 had to hold a big fireside chat in                                 December to like break that myth it's                                 like no you don't have to be working an                                 initiative to make a difference in core                                 work on your stuff                                 like anything you want to work on is                                 still great we still have the duoc                                 receive model it's just that these                                 things are strategically important                                 injuries wants to make sure they happen                                 and so he's like putting people on it to                                 focus on it and try and communicate out                                 to the community better what's happening                                 in course so it's my nervousness around                                 increased formalization is that every                                 time we've tried to do that we've like                                 it's it's been really hard and it's had                                 actually really negative consequences on                                 some other things I think on the whole                                 this was a good thing but I think there                                 has to be some amount of buy-in from                                 people that this is what we want to do                                 because the negatives I think are a                                 little bit not well explained here                                 they're very serious and we really have                                 to you know be concerned about that case                                 so Greg in his talk yesterday on on what                                 the learning about bike shedding which                                 was excellent talked about ways of                                 improving process without adding layers                                 of responsibility and so in a sense                                 you're saying that there's huge                                 consequences of adding layers of                                 responsibility because people feel                                 disempowered and stuff like that but                                 that's not the only thing that we're                                 talking about here so he mentioned time                                 boxing an issue okay so time boxing an                                 issue saying this issue is important we                                 are not going to let it die it must have                                 a resolution by a certain time frame is                                 not adding a layer of so so there's all                                 kinds of finesse that we can do in our                                 structure that is not just adding                                 lieutenants and sergeants and all that                                 kind of thing it it's more committing to                                 deal with the things that we ought to                                 deal with and making sure that they                                 don't get blocked by our own culture so                                 you know time boxing perhaps enabling                                 somebody to make a call or creating a                                 way so in if in the issue queue for                                 example you got an issue if we agree as                                 a community how a deadlock in an issue                                 is to be handled then we have a way to                                 handle it sure we can empower somebody                                 to call it that's one way but there                                 might be other ways as well                                 crow so on the same topic whether its                                 formal or informal or whatever a large                                 part of our problem is as you said you                                 know one person can block any issue and                                 even when we have someone who is                                 responsible for something either as an                                 initiative lead as a subsystem                                 maintainer as documentation lead you                                 know what whatever their role is however                                 formal or informal it is we don't have a                                 cultural sense that with that area of                                 responsibility comes the authority to do                                 it and I know people hate the word                                 authority but you know if the                                 documentation lead says we've looked at                                 it and we need to do X for documentation                                 you know we need to be able to say                                 documentation lead has said we need to                                 do X I'm going to trust their judgment                                 on this or I may disagree but they are                                 the person in charge of this I'm going                                 to let them do their job and this is one                                 of the biggest problems with d                                          you know we hired professional designers                                 and UX people to say look at Drupal and                                 come up with you know a UX revision and                                 they ran into a wall of knives from                                 people who didn't trust them to do what                                 their expertise was and what they were                                 hired to do and you know a cultural gone                                 flat i'll throw down is figure out what                                 area is it is where you will defer to                                 someone else who has more expertise if                                 you do not have such areas you are doing                                 it wrong whatever they are you know                                 maybe it's you will defer on code issues                                 to these people because you're a theme                                 or you don't deal with the deep code                                 maybe it's the other way around you know                                 I don't know markup you know I as a                                 module developer if you're fronting                                 person tell me what markup you want and                                 I will do it and I will trust you you                                 know we don't have that attitude of you                                 know there's people with expertise and                                 therefore they are more more important                                 than me their opinion is more important                                 in certain areas than others and that's                                 different for different subjects but                                 that is something we don't really have                                 that trust of other people in certain                                 areas I agree that we should acknowledge                                 leadership we should allow for                                 leadership and                                 we should accept it you know I think I                                 think we should embrace it how we do                                 that how we avoid too much                                 authoritarianism or whatever is is                                 another thing but I think we should                                 allow for leadership I we we sometimes                                 talk about ourselves like a like a                                 meritocracy and sometimes you know we've                                 tended more toward the duoc recy word in                                 recent years but there's a reason to let                                 somebody who is respected I mean                                 essentially we let Angie do anything she                                 wants because she deserves it right                                 anything she wants to do she can do she                                 deserves it well she shouldn't be the                                 only one and she shouldn't because of                                 that have to be the only conflict                                 resolver and she shouldn't you know all                                 these things that have accrued to her                                 are actually an over example of what                                 should be happening throughout the                                 community where the kind of cred that                                 web chick has should be spread                                 throughout the community explicitly and                                 deliberately that'd be my opinion chicks                                 go ahead and just as they were talking                                 about time boxing and this shook use it                                 reminded me a proposal that robert                                 douglas made six years ago or something                                 that one way to deal with this uq                                 abandonment is to make it a queue right                                 now it's just a dumping ground but if                                 you make it a queue where things go                                 first thing going first things go out so                                 if you want your patch to anything to                                 happen with it you need to look at you                                 need to have those that are in front of                                 it just reminding people that there was                                 a show making plans of plans that                                 changing our culture about how we deal                                 with code in the issue queue is an                                 interesting thing we still have                                    minutes right I'm not confused we're                                 okay okay tip no because I really want                                 the key thing is i want to write down                                 some paths forward                                 I I don't want to minimize the fact that                                 needing more governance is a good thing                                 that means that we've succeeded okay                                 we've done we've done really well and I                                 don't want to i was very much touched by                                 what ethyl jen siasat about that                                 conversation and conflict in the issue                                 queue is not it can be very very                                 positive so how do you like that kitten                                 picture huh so I'd like to make a list                                 let me flip back to where let me flip                                 back to where we are here and let's see                                 what if melissa has added two things so                                 that we've got so that we're together on                                 this yeah yeah okay the I wanted to take                                 a look at this slide and see if we have                                 things to add to it way too often and                                 this is this is actually one of drees                                 problems when he thinks about when he                                 thinks about governance is all he thinks                                 about is core development government                                 that that's it so you're shaking your                                 head no so I must be wrong what's that                                 okay it's totally not true so forget it                                 cancel it I'm wrong and she knows him a                                 lot better than I do but every time I                                 hear come so just forget that strike                                 that what I want my point is let's say                                 what are the areas the Drupal community                                 is a lot bigger than just court of code                                 development okay what are the areas                                 where we need to have a little have                                 something more than nothing so core                                 development is one place contribute to                                 place infrastructure security has a bit                                 of governance which is interesting                                 there's a bunch of implicit governance                                 in how we do security and that's well                                 thought out but it might not be                                 stated explicitly enough yeah so the                                 most important role in the security team                                 is a decider of deadlocked and you                                 formally have that so Greg is it so                                 you've invested Greg so they have a much                                 more sophisticated governance structure                                 okay yeah so I've noticed that security                                 has relatively has a relatively well                                 thought out model that you could call                                 governance yeah Angie okay good look she                                 says it and it appears that's amazing                                 security site function and content you                                 know I would love for drupal.org to have                                 a leader who was actually had a plan for                                 what it ought to be in a year there's                                 probably more than one way to do that                                 but one reason that drupal.org is a                                 morass is that it isn't really owned it                                 isn't really owned by a group that has a                                 plan for it and of course it's not just                                 drupal.org there's a bunch of others now                                  you could say that like localized                                  drupal.org does have a leader in a plan                                  and so some of the smaller areas do yep                                  one of the things Drees mentioned in his                                  keynote yesterday around content                                  authoring was a three step process for I                                  think discovery design and                                  implementation of improvements to                                  content authoring I think we could add                                  when an issue can be blocked to a place                                  to improve governance I know that's also                                  come up in whiskey should an issue                                  in the design phase BF visual content                                  authoring design changes or                                  architectural whiskey style design                                  changes should and it should be blocked                                  then or can someone wait six months                                  later until there's a completed patch                                  can it be blocked after all that work                                  has been yeah I agree completely in fact                                  i think i've got another slide with some                                  some ideas of the way that we could                                  improve our just our rules about how we                                  deal with issues and and I don't know                                  whether there I think drees has been                                  thinking about that and stuff let's see                                  there when I put community issues an                                  issue is a bad word there but there                                  there is actually stuff right in the                                  community that is I mean we're a big and                                  complex organization that has community                                  issues as well as these ones that can be                                  categorized in other places support                                  project application what other broad                                  subsets of what we call drupal need to                                  be on this list that we should be                                  thinking about you can you can mention                                  them later Adam a little later if you'd                                  like so I just was doing some                                  speculative thoughts about the core                                  development process a lot of you here                                  been involved in it and I was only doing                                  it because it was a way to think about                                  something that everybody's thought about                                  and so the initiative or lieutenant                                  concept is obviously something that we                                  have learned something about in the last                                  year leadership is something that I'd                                  mentioned but I think what you're saying                                  is like can we make the design and the                                  commits ability decisions earlier in the                                  earlier in the issue so right now in it                                  in a core issue the you there's nothing                                  certain until it goes in and it might                                  even be rolled back after that I don't                                  think we're going to I don't think we're                                  going to solve that problem because                                  that's that's just a normal risk of                                  software development so that's not but                                  the risk that you take to spend a year                                  working on an important issue and it                                  could be blocked by a bike shed at the                                  end is a huge risk so can we make the                                  commit ability decisions earlier is a is                                  a you know can we say this design                                  approved after adequate design bike shed                                  you know commit approved when it's our                                  TBC in other words the the maintainer                                  has signed off on it or whoever's                                  responsible for it has signed off on it                                  I think that just finding an explicit                                  way to say this is how a bike shed ends                                  would be a great thing for our community                                  I'm not sure exactly what we can do but                                  I don't think it's very hard the between                                  the time boxing idea yeah Angie well one                                  thing we this came up at the whiskey                                  sprint that we had um is you know this                                  this thing where there's people tearing                                  each other to shreds over like directory                                  structures you know there was blood on                                  the floor over directory structures                                  literally so the process in air quotes                                  that we came up with is if something and                                  ideally this would happen way before                                  there's blood on the floor but if                                  something is heading in that direction                                  where it's like there are two or more                                  very smart people who have very opposing                                  views on things the process that we came                                  up with was assign it to juries and                                  anybody who's in maintainer zat text it                                  for core can assign things to juries I                                  think we can I don't know the whole                                  permission scheme and everyone but we                                  could figure that out and then the goal                                  would be that juries would then say                                  either this is what we're doing or he                                  would say I trust Randy Fay to figure                                  out what we're doing here and then he or                                  the person assigned could also put a                                  time box on the decision so say I trust                                  Randy to make this decision let's try to                                  this wrapped up in two weeks or whatever                                  it is that's the process we're gonna                                  have to see how this works it did work                                  with the PSR zero issue you know it was                                  assigned to juries he was traveling or                                  whatever but within a week he come you                                  know commented back and said that's what                                  we're doing and the issue got marked                                  fixed and I haven't been online a lot                                  lately but it seemed like it stayed                                  maybe maybe um but you know we have a BD                                  FL let's use him basically well that                                  works see that still has the problem                                  that Jesus limited and and so I would                                  like to see that exact thing expanded                                  and and so that there were                                           trusted people in the community who                                  would be close to the problem and who                                  could be more responsive than he can                                  let's face it can't I mean he can't be                                  responsive on a hundred issues that                                  might need respond so let me just let me                                  just go to this the one thing that I                                  want to come out with ok so just at the                                  end here there's a reference to where                                  the resources are because there were                                  some great thinking you know like Jonah                                  Bacon's book and stuff like that and I                                  want to you know say that you should go                                  and write up the session and stuff like                                  that and the blog posts are listed here                                  so that's good but what I what I really                                  want to do is to take just a couple of                                  minutes and come out of here with a plan                                  of how we could within our current                                  Drupal world how we could go forward to                                  build a little bit more structure and                                  implement some of the things we found                                  out that work a Planning Commission for                                  improved governance how can we do that                                  and then and then we'll just run over                                  the time with what you guys have to say                                  is that all right yeah I just thought of                                  a small points I think we should have a                                  technical definition of what deadlock is                                  I'm what a bike Shetty's then we can                                  declare that this is this issue's bike                                  shedded yeah yeah yep on the road yep                                  that's a good idea yep have a                                  description of what when it becomes a                                  bike only if fifty-three percent of                                  the people agree that it's a bike shed                                  so                                  exactly so are there people in this room                                  who would be willing to work on                                  proposing to the community thinking                                  through and proposing to the community a                                  more extensive governance strategy yep                                  yep what we should do is we should we                                  should make an issue for it and have                                  people kind of sign on or we'll figure                                  out something like that how how would we                                  do it we just say that we came up with                                  this idea and we have self appointed                                  ourselves and if you want to join in you                                  can should we have a governance group                                  under on groups oh where are you going                                  oh oh you're you're just so polite okay                                  you looked like you had to say at that                                  second well okay on the topic of should                                  we have a governance group I would                                  suggest we make a core issue and assign                                  it to juries and he would then approve                                  or deny the governance group just to                                  model what the the conflict resolution                                  system Angie suggested trees could                                  decide should we have a governance                                  committee or not and will their                                  proposals have a chance of being adopted                                  on the idea of scaling the assign it                                  degrees technique I could see us using                                  an appeal process where if we had a                                  larger number variable yeah what's your                                  vision making authority it could be the                                  initiative leads it could be maintained                                  errs listed in core currently we could                                  assign issues to those people they could                                  make a decision and if someone still                                  wants to bike shed there could be in a                                  yeah yeah absolutely that's that's                                  basically what I'm saying is let's not                                  start with trees as the solver let's end                                  with trees as the solver yeah to be                                  clear that's what I meant I didn't mean                                  if you're bickering over like a little                                  thing besides I meant these big ones the                                  smoldering Peters the                                  that you point out like they must be                                  solved the thing I was going to come in                                  is another great thing that Greg said                                  during his talk in terms of strategies                                  was come in with a proposal don't open                                  with yes yeah you're out yeah evidence                                  like the you know four or five people                                  who want to like work on that get                                  together you know ask some people you                                  know do that kind of thing and then come                                  to the community with a proposal because                                  then it becomes a what do you think of                                  this right and then we can say well I                                  don't like that aspect it or don't like                                  this aspect of it but it doesn't become                                  a well I think we should do that catford                                  all of that or a related thing and this                                  is related this might be exactly what                                  you're saying about what Greg said is                                  that too often in the issue queue when                                  you have an opinion made person they                                  will just say you can't do that and we                                  should probably build into our system                                  into our into our culture that you                                  generally work from a what you should do                                  what we can do rather than just blocking                                  with you can't so but yeah go ahead I                                  found that the biggest issue about                                  proposing process to a group of people                                  is is how you convey that information to                                  the group of people because it's so                                  incredibly difficult for people to                                  consume this much information and it's                                  also very difficult for people to both                                  understand like the the grand scheme and                                  the details of it so for like in a                                  governance proposal group you know their                                  job is like the information architecture                                  of the document of the processes and the                                  details of them so that they're really                                  easy to consume and then to bring them                                  to the community in in small consumable                                  parts for review so that it's easier for                                  people to consume them and give feedback                                  yeah and I can't see us getting very far                                  with like a dog you meant although that                                  maybe that's where we're going to go but                                  we're we're basically out of time and I                                  want you to go ahead and talk anyway so                                  we'll just keep talking anyway but what                                  I propose                                  is this I think that the issue approach                                  might work for us and if there's not a                                  governance project I would propose                                  creating a governance project and                                  talking there is that sound crazy is                                  that son that's all right okay we can                                  all find it so if it doesn't already                                  exist then we'll go out and make                                  drupal.org / project / governance and                                  people can make proposals there and sign                                  up to work there and we can experiment a                                  little bit there and see if we can                                  create some bike ships so yeah go to                                  play devil's advocate a little bit we                                  already have a code of conduct that no                                  one ever points to it says hey you know                                  you're not sending down considerately                                  but then we're talking about also                                  establishing this no governance document                                  kind of thing that again maybe not be                                  people may not be like oh you're                                  violating rule like                                                  governance code of conduct like I agree                                  that something needs to be done to                                  change that but we already have this                                  awesome awesome code of conduct the code                                  of conduct right now only deals with                                  culture and it punts on governance and                                  that kind of the problem is that the I                                  mean people do point to it quite often                                  and i think we probably should more but                                  it only for culture and I think it has                                  no conflict resolution in it it has no                                  what to do when you have problem in the                                  issue queue it has no how do we result                                  result of like this is on the the people                                  who have accepted that code of conduct                                  so you know sure we're in a bike shed                                  argument about like what directory                                  structure we're calling it but some of                                  its you know like all right I understand                                  that we're in a rut here and we need to                                  step back considerately like that's it's                                  a thing that's already in the books and                                  you know I don't know I know that's a                                  big problem and say like our own                                  government like the United States                                  government you know you have                                         rules on the same thing and we're just                                  adding more rules                                  more rules to kinda we don't want to do                                  though she's like devil's advocate here                                  I agree that something does need to be                                  done but yeah thank you yep crow just                                  also want to highlight that different                                  problems and different types of bike                                  sheds need different kinds of solutions                                  yeah I mean there's the issue that is                                  deadlocked because Krell and checks cap                                  degree or checks and son can't degree or                                  sun and Damien can't degree which is a                                  completely different problem space then                                  there's someone in this issue who is                                  outnumbering everyone else in terms of                                  posts to                                                               what they're talking about they may be                                  well-meaning but there an issue queue                                  vampire both problems exist I have been                                  involved in both of them some would                                  argue i'm on both sides of those but                                  that's another story but those are                                  different problems and we need to come                                  up with ways of addressing both of those                                  and those are going to be different                                  whatever those are I don't know but                                  those are different problems let's see                                  we still have a duoc recei does anybody                                  can go to put a picture on the screen                                  while we're looking at it yeah so you                                  know how we resolve you know the bike                                  shed is different than the issue queue                                  vampyre problem yep and I green issues                                  destroyed by both hips yeah chicks one                                  thing that kind of works universally in                                  the world regardless of countries is I                                  don't remember the English word for it                                  is this arbiter orbit arbitration                                  signing or do something we could do kid                                  have issues go into binding arbitration                                  yes I like it one thing we could do is                                  to have I like you like community                                  leaders so if you haven't liked it that                                  it dad love this show then we could have                                  a committee leaders who named orbiters                                  who like I don't know what I like they                                  are doing and then they decide like                                  three or five people who and then what                                  they decide is the decision I like it                                  you could have a yeah I like it that's                                  very simple and it fits right within our                                  model it just gives us a way to break it                                  yeah I like it so yes sir                                  dying ideas come right up to it so that                                  it yeah you hear me I think there is                                  some working model of this multiple                                  level of lieutenants and things I can                                  make decisions and this working model                                  allows do not have the problem of they                                  are responsible I think a lot of sites                                  and communities use this Karma's /                                  badges system so basically the more you                                  contribute to the community to projects                                  the more rights you have I think that's                                  a relatively simple so the so the                                  recognition of the structure of our                                  community is another whole thing which I                                  have opinions about but I think it's not                                  exactly the same thing maybe it is the                                  same thing but we definitely I think we                                  need to expose the structure of our                                  community but I'm not sure it's the same                                  issue but it might be it might be CRO so                                  just to push back a little on the                                  binding arbitration concept well I like                                  it in theory it runs into the problem                                  that one things check said you know that                                  arbitration be someone who knows what                                  they're doing in most cases odds are the                                  person who most knows what they're doing                                  is one of the people involved I mean if                                  there's some question about you know                                  some deadlock in the                                  internationalisation system gobber's the                                  one who should be resolving that odds                                  are Gobber is also one of the people in                                  that debate because he's the                                  internationalisation guys he's probably                                  in the debate already and you know I                                  don't know what we do with that that's                                  that's not it is not necessarily true                                  you could take apple gentie and throw                                  him at any one of those and he he'd be a                                  fair orbiter I mean there aren't that                                  many people like him but you can you                                  could take him you got it you promoted                                  man you can take a bow but no so I'm                                  saying it's not necessarily true but I                                  can understand your point the impartial                                  expert is I think a lot harder to find                                  then we give it credit for because                                  most people who would be domain experts                                  are not impartial by the time we get to                                  that point yeah yeah I I think that by                                  now we are large enough that we actually                                  have the kind of experts who could move                                  when we have actually seen this already                                  happening without the formal structure                                  usually what happens is when it should                                  get that log David Rosen gets involved                                  and then sings move oh I have seen that                                  many times actor but what I wanted to                                  say is that badges are extremely                                  controversial on drupal.org because we                                  don't want you have said you know that                                  they are doing this right and that                                  budgeting very easily could lead to that                                  you know that somebody with this list of                                  badges just something and then the new                                  contributor who actually might know more                                  about it he's just not much into Drupal                                  might be intimidated into not into not                                  doing what is actually the right thing                                  so I am very much against doing that                                  this is also the reason even an IRC                                  freenode it encourages the opt not to be                                  up to all the time not to intimidate                                  everybody why does everybody come up                                  here and talk that way and use this mic                                  it doesn't make any sense for you to be                                  looking at me you talk to everybody else                                  okay so one of the points raised was                                  that not having a lot of governance                                  actually empowers people and that by                                  adding new layers and new lieutenants                                  you are actually making it so that                                  certain people and many people don't                                  feel empowered enough but what I would                                  like to argue is that those people are                                  only empowers to solve trivial things                                  and that without having a certain level                                  of governance and without having                                  initiatives it wouldn't actually be able                                  to solve big things and to rework large                                  parts of Drupal and I think that having                                  initiatives has allowed us to rework a                                  lot more than we could have been able                                  before and I as an individual am really                                  scared when thinking for example of                                  reworking comment module everything else                                  because if I try to suggest a large                                  changes                                  I know that it will be bike shedded to                                  death and it will die and I really don't                                  have the energy to just talk so much and                                  not do so much so that's my point thank                                  you one mechanism which hasn't beaten a                                  vote is the one used by the PHP group                                  and a tree projects in general which is                                  the camera mechanism we have something                                  about camera in the channels but it                                  isn't used for anything currently as far                                  as I know and on PHP projects the level                                  of karma can give you some rights for                                  for recognition on the project and using                                  such a mechanism might be useful for us                                  turn to for people to obtain actual                                  recognition beyond them their name not                                  run clear about that you mean when                                  people accrue karma points by doing some                                  things for the community solving issues                                  are getting in a massive purchaser some                                  people will know because they follow                                  these oh yes should i restart no Yakima                                  as I said karma is currently not really                                  used on Drupal except for Fernand                                  channel but if you look at how it works                                  with the PHP projects and gaining karma                                  points will gain your recognition and                                  actual rights on at some points in the                                  system and currently and when people do                                  important work on car like a certain                                  closing not eight for instance some                                  people we know because they follow the                                  issue but many want and solving youjizz                                  us can give you a recognition which                                  could help in and provide recognition                                  levels for some people who have some                                  expertise of a actual level of                                  involvement in the project I thoroughly                                  agree and I hadn't had that thought that                                  the exposure of our community structure                                  through expressing what people have done                                  in it was part                                  the governance discussion but maybe it                                  is and I think we should consider that I                                  think we should probably bail because                                  we're running out of juice I found the                                  governance project doesn't exist I'm                                  going to create it please create issues                                  there and will sign you up and Angie you                                  can have the last word I said something                                  really quick which was a suggestion to                                  the you know committee ad hoc committee                                  that sort of works on this is rather                                  than trying to come up with a big                                  overarching plan for everything I mean                                  it seems like we have some really good                                  low-hanging fruit like let's fill out                                  that to do in the conflict resolution                                  policy it's my opinion that because our                                  community is so valuable to us and works                                  very well in many many ways that we                                  should be experimenting with little                                  changes and not making big I don't want                                  to write a Drupal Constitution I think                                  that would be a big mistake I think we                                  should get community agreement for small                                  changes that will unblock some of our                                  key things and that may take us                                  somewhere down the line in five years                                  when we're even bigger but I think we                                  should be doing looking for low hanging                                  fruit addressing it and finding ways to                                  solve our problems without a huge                                  structural change but let's do call it                                  and please do check in i'll just create                                  that project in a minute or two check in                                  there and thank you very much for your                                  care for drupal thank you for caring oh                                  yeah don't forget the evaluation I                                  already said that but it's there yeah                                  thanks a lot                                  you
