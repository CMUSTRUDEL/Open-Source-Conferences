Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: THROWN INTO A SHARK POND?
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	Have you ever tried to submit a core improvement suggestion? Two common experiences I have seen is that your issue is ignored or dissected to pieces and beyond possibility to move forward. Did you feel sometimes like you are attempting to navigate in a shark pond? Or maybe more like this guy? http://www.flickr.com/photos/egarc2/2437521787/ Being a Drupal core developer for about nine years and a core committer (Drupal 6 maintainer) for five years, I have experience on all sides of the situation. We'll look at examples of issues gone wrong and cover issue queue psychology. You'll get tips and tricks on how to get your issues noticed and avoid them becoming shipwrecks. I hope to help individuals and companies alike who intend to invest in Drupal core to find your place and be a productive and happy member of the core development team.

Questions answered by this session: 
How can I get my issues noticed by Drupal core developers?
I'd like to contribute but don't know how!
How can I get my employees/co-workers get the best out of time spent with core improvements?
Is core development really a hard and tedious job?
How do I track where Drupal core development is heading and how do I fit in?
