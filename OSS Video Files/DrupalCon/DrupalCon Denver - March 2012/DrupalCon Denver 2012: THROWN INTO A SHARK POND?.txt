Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: THROWN INTO A SHARK POND?
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	Have you ever tried to submit a core improvement suggestion? Two common experiences I have seen is that your issue is ignored or dissected to pieces and beyond possibility to move forward. Did you feel sometimes like you are attempting to navigate in a shark pond? Or maybe more like this guy? http://www.flickr.com/photos/egarc2/2437521787/ Being a Drupal core developer for about nine years and a core committer (Drupal 6 maintainer) for five years, I have experience on all sides of the situation. We'll look at examples of issues gone wrong and cover issue queue psychology. You'll get tips and tricks on how to get your issues noticed and avoid them becoming shipwrecks. I hope to help individuals and companies alike who intend to invest in Drupal core to find your place and be a productive and happy member of the core development team.

Questions answered by this session: 
How can I get my issues noticed by Drupal core developers?
I'd like to contribute but don't know how!
How can I get my employees/co-workers get the best out of time spent with core improvements?
Is core development really a hard and tedious job?
How do I track where Drupal core development is heading and how do I fit in?

	                              so I'm of course going to publish the                               digital version of this it's not just on                               paper but I wanted to give it out to you                               so that you can follow the session                               better and so if you wanted to go                               somewhere else you can now tell in                                  seconds if you want to stay here or go                               out ok so I'm gabrovo cheap I'm a nine                               years with the Drupal project i started                                in                                                                    picture where people like stand by a                                fountain and it's very dark and you can                                almost not tell who are two phases so i                                was there so so I'm an old guy here I                                maintainer for Drupal                                                that perspective of this problem I'm the                                guy who gets in your patches and                                convinced them to Drupal                                           makes the releases and decides what gets                                in there what's not good what's not                                going to get in those kinds of things I                                also started working for aquia in                                     kind of funny I'm employee number one at                                aqua yeah I started working at Acquia                                because before anybody knew aqua even                                exists and I and I was paid full time to                                work on Drupal                                                       the Drupal                                                          lead which means that the Drupal                                community partitions my free time for                                different things on on the Drupal                                  multilingual scene and I I almost had                                like back-to-back meetings here with                                different people in the community                                discussing different things which are at                                different parts of this handout so for                                those who are not here and watching this                                on a video this is the handout I gave                                out to you and it start with I have an                                idea for Drupal core which could also be                                I have a problem with Drupal core and                                the goal of the session is to get                                through the party at the end and find                                that find the right way and figure out                                how to get to that point so that's the                                goal of our session so I start it starts                                with I have an idea for Drupal core and                                that's usually or I have a problem with                                Drupal core and as usually people post                                something                                they might might not if there's a                                problem they might not tell which triple                                core version it is or if they have an                                idea they likely have a very clear path                                of which version they choose but it's                                very important to think first about                                which tuple version you want to use if                                you've been to Joyce keynote you've seen                                that the different Drupal versions are                                at very different parts of their                                lifetime drupal                                                 released in                                                            certain drupal                                                       and Drupal                                                      thousand eight so Drupal                                            year old product or release at least and                                it's still out they still use a lot so                                depending on what depending on what kind                                of idea you have or what kind of problem                                you want to solve based on the based on                                the state these versions are in their                                lifetime the Drupal community will                                respond to your requests or your idea in                                very different ways so all the shininess                                goes to Drupal                                                 shininess goes to do plate because                                that's the new upcoming version that can                                change anything whatever we want to and                                some shininess can go to Drupal                                         in his core conversation today that we                                loosened the policy of back boring stuff                                to Drupal                                                               Mike put some stuff out it's not it's                                not a huge change so we did not                                introduce lots of huge changes there and                                we also maintain Drupal                                              version so there's a lot of contributing                                models out there and Drupal sevens use                                more and more increasingly and we want                                to keep those country modules table and                                we sometimes introduce little problems                                that we do not intend to introduce but                                the main goal there is to maintain the                                Drupal                                                                  it's and it's absolutely the goal for                                Drupal                                                                  possible so to get something into Drupal                                                                                                    begin to Drupal                                                    impossible for you to get something new                                 and shiny you would better go to Drupal                                                                                                new and shiny to duple                                              process for that as well that we will                                 get to shortly so examples for this like                                 if you want to go to fix something in                                 Drupal                                                                 like taxonomy performance improvements                                 that's kind of a funny thing because we                                 fixed some taxonomy speed problems in                                 the latest Drupal                                                    that fix we've introduced some taxonomy                                 memory problems in Drupal                                               of an interesting issue to follow their                                 we also fix security fixes and there are                                 always things in earlier Drupal versions                                 that are not in later Drupal versions                                 like blog API that was removed in Drupal                                                                                                          with blog API or something that you want                                 to fix their or slightly improve then                                 that's possible in Drupal                                               court anymore so you can go directly to                                 Drupal                                                                 we would do our also security fixes and                                 other performance and maintenance issues                                 but also slight improvements to how it                                 works UI tweaks we found issues with how                                 field configuration are how the field                                 configuration workflow is coded and                                 we've eliminated once queen of that                                 workflow for example so there's things                                 like those improvements that can get in                                 there easily that's likely not going to                                 happen at all for Drupal                                           Drupal                                                                  new configuration API like basing a lot                                 of things in symfony                                                 basically anything goes whatever we                                 agree on we can do and we we can build                                 it so based on what you want to do                                 there's these are very different areas                                 and if you want to like fix language                                 like the language code form field in                                 Drupal                                                                 I'm that I I've seen people encounter                                 that it allowed the long language code                                 and the database schema allowed a short                                 language code and the form field made it                                 look like it can be longer so we wanted                                 to fix that in Drupal and somebody's                                 submit a patch for Drupal                                                obliged to say in that case is that                                 please don't do                                 please fix that issue first in Drupal                                   and then backport to Drupal                                            backport to Drupal                                                      apply to multiple to perversions                                 fortunately and unfortunately our way of                                 solving them is to first fix them in the                                 latest version and then backport them as                                 we go so if you want if you want to want                                 to fix something or improve something                                 something in Drupal                                                   likely will be pushed to Drupal                                         then you will need to figure out in DU                                 Bellay first and then go back that's                                 pretty bad if you don't have the                                 resources or if you're not interested in                                 figuring out all the fixing the same                                 thing with all the changes in Drupal                                   so it kind of increases your required                                 involvement in fixing the issue for the                                 Drupal community and for Drupal at large                                 it's very nice because it means that we                                 are not introducing regressions in later                                 versions of Drupal so if you go to fix                                 something in Drupal                                                     already in Drupal                                                        like try to forward port it the reason                                 we don't forward port is because we we                                 cannot actually assume that it's going                                 to be in in the later later versions                                 before they are released next so that's                                 basically our process it's kind of a and                                 overhead that we need to work with so                                 there's basically two two ways you can                                 choose based on the version and the size                                 of the change that you want to take you                                 and I've titled this with help from a                                 lot of people with I want to make sure                                 to implement right and I need to have it                                 implemented now and there's a lot of                                 cases you need to have implemented now                                 and I'm I'm involved with a lot of those                                 cases at aquia and indoor gardens and i                                 will give you a few examples for that                                 and there is also a lot of good cases                                 for i want to make sure to implement it                                 right and basically the Drupal                                     scenario applies if if you're don't have                                 time to work on the core development                                 process you like need to have like you                                 found an issue on your site and you need                                 to have this fixed right now and you                                 need to get it out of your deployment if                                 your business needs a shorter time to                                 to get your fix ism if you have a huge                                 disagreement with the community as no                                 way you can make it work or if the                                 extent of the change is not allowed in                                 the version that you are involved with                                 so there's a lot of reasons for that and                                 we'll see how we're going this way can                                 benefit the Drupal community at the end                                 so if you at first seem like you want to                                 go this way it might be a very fine                                 decision and you might be able to just                                 come back to the Drupal community with                                 your improvements and it can be a very                                 good experience for both of both you and                                 the community I basically outline two                                 separate ways to solve this case so if                                 you need to implement something now in                                 Drupal                                                              either use custom patches or you want to                                 use override hooks if you want to use                                 custom patches I would suggest you that                                 you track your patches very carefully                                 like maintain a list of what patches you                                 have and there's two great methods for                                 that there is documentation to branch                                 from the Drupal core git repository and                                 there's documentation and tools for                                 using a patch application system in rush                                 make where you can say I want to use                                 this Drupal core version and I want to                                 apply these set of patches on that and I                                 want to deploy that to my environment so                                 these are good tools to track your                                 patches and rush make until recently                                 actually forced you to reference remote                                 patches so that hopefully you would                                 submit those patches on drupal.org it                                 now supports using patches from the                                 local file system but if at all possible                                 you should submit your patches to court                                 anyway kind of a funny a note here is                                 that for Drupal                                                      review process for me for for for                                 deciding whether it should go to Drupal                                                                                                          a live environment and it worked for you                                 in the live environment or not so I'm                                 looking at issue and if there's multiple                                 people who experienced it working well                                 and there's multiple people who thought                                 that the that could look good then I                                 have a lot more confidence in getting                                 that in so although this looks like I'm                                 die I'm diverging from the Drupal                                 really and I'm like for King Drupal core                                 and I'm making my own version of Drupal                                 what it actually means is that you're                                 experimenting with changes and you are                                 trying them out and you see how how it                                 goes and then you can push it back at                                 the community and say you work good for                                 me it's solved my problem or it improved                                 and implemented my idea and please take                                 it if you want it and even if you don't                                 follow up on that patch we just submit a                                 patch and and you leave it there                                 somebody might take it off we'll see a                                 lot of good reasons for you to follow up                                 on that patch and try to get in core but                                 if you like need to go this way your                                 business requires it or just you want to                                 have your stuff out quick them this is                                 not a sin just do it right there is over                                 right hooks in Drupal so Drupal a lot of                                 the cases allows you to ignore stuff                                 that Drupal would otherwise do and do                                 something else instead in my basic                                 summary Drupal things that things                                 happening in trouble usually happen two                                 ways it's either an HTTP request or or                                 add roshka man or something that comes                                 in through another josh command                                 necessarily so it's an HTTP request it                                 comes through the menu system which is                                 very misleadingly named in Drupal that's                                 basically a router system that maps URLs                                 to functions and invoke them and check                                 permissions on them so the request comes                                 in and the menu system chooses who's                                 going to execute this thing and who's                                 going to produce the output for this                                 thing and if you have an issue with the                                 concrete page or set of pages that has a                                 has a menu call back in the system and                                 you can use the hook menu all the filter                                 function to drop out what's there and                                 put in your own stuff so this is one                                 thing that we do sometimes in Drupal                                 gardens when we want to simplify things                                 in Drupal core and we want to drop some                                 very confusing pages or tabs from from                                 things in court etc we altered those out                                 and we think in many cases we simplify                                 your life for you there's also all kinds                                 of other cases like xml RPC call backs                                 or cron                                 callbacks etc which are not going                                 through the menu system they are like                                 January cooks that are invoked in                                 different ways there's a very powerful                                 function called hookah module implements                                 elter that allows you to do anything                                 with hooks like you can remove hooks for                                 modules and add some other hook instead                                 and do all kinds of things it's very                                 powerful it's very dangerous at the same                                 time just like hook menu elter so these                                 two who these two hooks basically allow                                 you to outer almost anything in Drupal                                 core without applying custom patches                                 however you need to copy paste the code                                 that's there and make your modifications                                 and then there if there's any changes in                                 that code later in later versions you                                 need to maintain those in your copy                                 pasted version so the work is kind of on                                 you but you add them maintain patches so                                 some people prefer this process and some                                 people prefer the other process now                                 these are big chunks of code so like                                 like dropping out a hookah on                                 implementation and replacing it with                                 your own or dropping out a whole page                                 callback and replacing it with your own                                 could be a huge amount of code there's a                                 lot more and more targeted ultra hooks                                 like the hoop for melt or who page LT                                 hooks that allow you to alter the page                                 structure inside the page or l                                 tournament the forum and how the forum                                 is processed and how the items are                                 validated and all kinds of other things                                 so if you have ideas improvements                                 additions you want to add two things you                                 can use these hooks to do all the work                                 be very careful because internal api's                                 might change that those functions use in                                 turn internally there can be any number                                 of changes there in the Drupal core as                                 long as it's not a generic API functions                                 like page callbacks forms can change the                                 bigger to change the more divergent you                                 get from core so the harder it's going                                 to get to tell what you change there and                                 what needs to be updated but there's a                                 lot of a lot of modules built almost                                 exclusively based on elder hooks and                                 providing things                                 so if you've been to Earl miles session                                 earlier this week I think the second                                 slide he lead with basically you can                                 understand page manager as a UI for                                 hookah manual turn because that's what                                 is so you can alter what how that                                 request is going to be processed than                                 what's going to happen there so there's                                 whole modules and very popular modules                                 built around this concept of overriding                                 all things in core so it's again not a                                 sin it's something that's provided by                                 Drupal core but be careful with how you                                 use that and you can cycle back all                                 those changes as a country module and                                 then you can cycle that all those                                 suggestions as a core patch and I wrote                                 drupal                                                                   if there's our fixes for triple six or                                 seven then feel free to submit there as                                 well okay so I've explained two methods                                 for solving your problem when you need                                 to implement something right now you                                 don't need to cooperate with the Drupal                                 community for any of these things you go                                 on your own stuff you do your own custom                                 patch or you do we run over right hooks                                 you can collaborate with the community                                 by submitting your right hooks as a set                                 of a set of override hooks as a module                                 and your patches in the drupal.org issue                                 queue and then hopefully you will follow                                 up with with those for the community so                                 they can get all those changes this is                                 very good for for fulfilling your                                 business requirements and getting fixes                                 in very fast and moving forward but if                                 you want to implement it right you get a                                 lot of benefit by working with the                                 community because you can get feedback                                 from the community from all your changes                                 that you make it's sometimes good                                 feedback sometimes bad feedback you need                                 to tell its how it works we are humans                                 so you get a lot of feedback on what                                 what you did they help you use best                                 practices we have a lot of lot of                                 process to help you use the right coding                                 standards to help you use the right AP                                 is to help you use                                 do I approaches to things so we have a                                 lot of process where people come in and                                 help you figure that out before it can                                 get into core so you basically have it                                 all cleaned up by a team of smart people                                 i love this process because i'm so I i                                 am a CS major but i would not be able to                                 work in like                                                         like that i'm not not at all that so my                                 mind is limited to certain things and I                                 always like the Drupal community can                                 extend my mind infinitely so they can                                 help help with all the stuff that I                                 either did not have the time or did not                                 care or did not have the knowledge to                                 care for it also helps you fix it across                                 Drupal versions which is great if you                                 want it to fix it in your Drupal                                        you write an override hooker custom                                 patch if you work with the community to                                 get it in when you have great to Drupal                                                                                                      worry about that problem anymore because                                 you've got it in Drupal so the community                                 takes care for you and wards right so                                 you can fix it across Drupal versions                                 you don't need to care about it anymore                                 which is also the next point you can get                                 it off your plate and if it's in Drupal                                 core then it's going to be maintained                                 with the rest of this stuff so you can                                 just use no requirement for you to                                 maintain anymore and the best one I                                 think is last one that you can make                                 others build off of those changes so                                 like if if you are fixing the theme                                 functions in Drupal core to be much                                 nicer than all the other contributors                                 themes would work from those theme                                 functions and everybody would be happier                                 with those changes so you can take those                                 contributed themes and it would be                                 easier for you to tweak them etc because                                 you fix the underlying issues which made                                 them harder to tweak right so if you if                                 you help Drupal core fix issues then                                 everybody else will work with that                                 system and that's one of the reasons i'm                                 sticking to core development all the                                 time and although i sometimes have my                                 down moments as well this is the reason                                 that i'm trying to put all the stuff                                 into Drupal core because it means that                                 others will work with that thing and I                                 don't need to pray for all the module                                 maintainer stew like please implement my                                 API because it's in Drupal core and they                                 will work with                                 okay so it's very powerful you extend                                 your you extend your arms very far and I                                 get a few quotes from people Kathleen                                 sandy said that she enjoys working                                 towards a common cause with smart                                 friendly people which is kind of what I                                 feel as well and a little bit different                                 perspective from chicks he said he                                 definitely finds it in intrinsically                                 rewarding in other words yes this is                                 done right gives me great joy so you get                                 a lot of feedback and you kind of get a                                 lot of verification that your fix is                                 good and it's not just like something                                 you did on the side and it works for you                                 but who knows whether it's actually good                                 or not and whether you install two more                                 country modules and it's going to break                                 down in flames okay so it's very good                                 for for your work long term and I set                                 this up into two different branches as                                 well the first is you start an issue the                                 second is started discussion it totally                                 depends on the size of the change you                                 want to make so if you want to do                                 content staging in Drupal core starting                                 with an issue it's likely the worst                                 thing you can do because it's a huge                                 topic and needs to be broken down two                                 different things you need to have a                                 discussion with people either on either                                 here at rubicon or on groups of double                                 at org or on IRC etc I like try to get                                 opinion and socialize your idea share it                                 with people and get feedback and then                                 when you have it broken down you can                                 start working on issues if it's a small                                 problem like fix the damn language feel                                 to be shorter because it's shorting the                                 database and you start with an issue                                 okay and then in both cases I've said                                 before that if you have a core patch you                                 submitted to the issue queue and if you                                 leave it alone that's still fine but if                                 you want to get all these benefits here                                 you need to manage it through the review                                 process it's not like you submit that                                 patch and then armies of Drupal people                                 will jump on it and fix it for you                                 because Drupal core they care about                                 fixing those things for Drupal core it's                                 likely not going to happen what's much                                 more likely going to happen is that                                 nobody cares about it at all you                                 submitted issue and it sits there for                                 months and nobody cares about it ever so                                 if you look at the issue stats for                                 core I pulled this from from tubular org                                 bug reports overall on average are not                                 fixed for                                                             getting in to the fixed state for                                    weeks feature requests a lot more time                                 okay so this is on average so there's a                                 lot there's a lot more to to the other                                 two to the other end where there is like                                 years and years things are not fixed so                                 if you just put it there and wait for                                 someone to find it it's not going to                                 happen you need to maintain it through                                 the review process find people get get                                 those reviews manage all those reviews                                 put-put updates and then managed it to                                 get it in it's a lot of work but you get                                 all the benefits that I mentioned before                                 and the Drupal community gets all the                                 benefits as well and there's also a                                      core issues so you submit it it's likely                                 nobody's going to find it so what are                                 you important to start an issue in a way                                 that people can identify what is about                                 there is issue submission guidelines on                                 that URL it's in the head it's on the                                 handout as well and there is a most                                 common issue text document right there                                 so Drupal people like to add all kinds                                 of meta information on their issues why                                 it's related to what kind of problems it                                 solves performance problem or whether it                                 needs tests or whether it's related to                                 any initiative etc so those are those                                 are what we use text for and the issue                                 submission guidelines explain how to use                                 different status of issues and the                                 different components that we have I'm                                 not going into those details here                                 because that would take                                                  but there's where it's document if you                                 have any questions you can come up at                                 the end what I'm more interested in is                                 how you get your issue noticed so this                                 is like submitting it though that so                                 that people understand what it is but                                 then you need to get people there's a                                 lot of ways to get your issues noticed                                 there is Drupal initiatives that are                                 official initiatives for Drupal core and                                 it's a very few of those mentioned                                 compared to all the things that's going                                 on for Drupal core is just a tiny                                 of things but they are there are things                                 that cover a lot of big big problems so                                 there's configuration management web                                 services design multilingual html                                        is mobile there's layout so there's all                                 those things if your problem or idea                                 maps to these initiatives you can find                                 these people here and their respective                                 groups you go to the news link and you                                 can find who is working on that and how                                 to get involved and you have issues link                                 there that you can look at all their                                 issues and you can get your issues into                                 their issue queues if it's related to                                 their work okay there's also a lot of                                 other things that people work on this is                                 not a very up-to-date page but Jupiter                                 our community initiative / Drupal core                                 has a lot more initiatives that are not                                 official initiatives but people work on                                 them it's a lot of sub pages of                                 different things that people work on and                                 who to contact and and what they plan to                                 work on etc bear in mind that this is                                 much less up-to-date compared to the                                 Drupal                                                                 require a lot of love but it helps you                                 identify people who are interested in                                 things and what they want to work on etc                                 to plug in your things there's also                                 interests groups on groups or double org                                 if you pick working groups in the group                                 type then you get groups like to play                                 blocks and layout everywhere initiative                                 or MTD API or a space advocacy which is                                 likely not a Drupal core patch thing etc                                 so although I do have rocket ship for                                 Drupal core issue issue overviews now                                 that I i connect the dots so so there's                                 all kinds of working groups that you can                                 chew you can join and find people there                                 who are interested in the same thing so                                 if you have an entity API thing that you                                 can go to that group and find people                                 there and post there if you think that                                 you're                                 my idea is interesting for them a very                                 interesting approach that I am not                                 seeing a lot of people uses go to the                                 history of the files that you want to                                 change this is an example of robots.txt                                 which is not a very good example but                                 it's a very short URL so that's why I                                 chose that one so I can put the URL on                                 the slide so you go to Drupal co.org                                 pick the Drupal core branch I go to the                                 file and look for its log and the log                                 tells you two very important things one                                 is who worked on this file so there's                                 all the names of people who worked on                                 this thing okay so those people are                                 likely interested in changes to this                                 file there's also all the issue numbers                                 that were discussed regarding this file                                 so if you find issues that are similar                                 or or or even reasons for the bugs or                                 problems that you are trying to solve                                 then you go to that issue and post a                                 comment i found a related bug please see                                 here and help me fix it and all those                                 people are also likely interested in                                 more fixes to this because they they                                 cared about it they worked on stuff for                                 this so you can try to find them and try                                 to talk to them about your changes again                                 Roberts the text not a good example it's                                 not like something that people are                                 passionate about dislike people find                                 bugs with it and they fix it but that's                                 basically how how to find like concrete                                 people who work them on stuff and that                                 is again if you've been to JC score                                 conversation there's a lot of talk on                                 data and how we have a lot of data that                                 we don't use and this is there will be                                 very good data I had a discussion last                                 rubicon with people that if we can mind                                 this data and like put on people's                                 profiles that this guy worked on rob us                                 the text and the entity thing in etc and                                 you can like find people who worked on                                 the entity thing you click on the entity                                 thing and it could list all the people                                 who were participating in those issues                                 etc so we have a lot of data we don't                                 have a lot of tools for you to mine them                                 you need to manually look look up these                                 people and when you have people you can                                 find these people on IRC there's Drupal                                 people I've using IRC it's a

                recently but it's an insane amount of                                 people subscribe to google planet it's                                 just it's it's unbelievable so there's a                                 lot of ways to get feedback on your                                 issue okay so you need to find people to                                 get there you have ways on you

to IRC going to                                 office hours advert                                 your stuff on drupal planet at drupalcon                                 buffs etc and then you have a different                                 problem because now everybody is on your                                 issue and they pose all kinds of stuff                                 and and as there's no no end in sight ok                                 so I think a lot of you would love to                                 have this problem but if you post if you                                 post very interesting stuff you might                                 end up with this problem and it equally                                 requires some experience and people                                 skills to be able to move forward from                                 this point just like that nobody cares                                 about your point so when everybody cares

should                                 consider all feedback but I do not care                                 it to everybody there's going to be all                                 kinds of people wanting to sidetrack                                 your discussion to all different all                                 kinds of different ways so try not to                                 cater to everybody I try to stay at to                                 try to keep your issue focused and we                                 solve it as as focused as possible                                 instead of letting it explode keep your                                 issue summary updated people come                                 there's so the usual summer is the                                 original version of the issue that as                                 was submitted and then everybody can go                                 and edit that summary to update it to                                 how the latest discussion and decisions                                 are shaping it's very good for new                                 people coming in to like see their let's                                 be what what is already decided and                                 what's still to be decided at centra so                                 they are not diverging as much from the                                 main topic that you want to keep and yes                                 Drupal core development requires you to                                 devote serious time sometimes do that so                                 try to be present on that issue and                                 respond where needed issues can get                                 stuck when when you don't we you don't                                 respond to questions or concerns and                                 these just sits around and nobody knows                                 where to go and if there's a lot of                                 sight tracks that are appearing then                                 have an overall plan with follow ups                                 that you're going to fix later it's not                                 the task of this issue to fix them but                                 you gotta fix them                                 and there is a drupal code of conduct                                 that we have for for working with the                                 Drupal community the reason I bring this                                 up in on this slide is because these are                                 the discussions where the air can get                                 very hot very fast and if you can keep                                 in mind that all those guys are people                                 and all those guys are well-intentioned                                 and they want to have your stuff be good                                 for Drupal core then then you should all                                 be good so for these big things people                                 do different approaches to to try and                                 try and get their stuff in Drupal core                                 and these are three approaches that I'm                                 seeing working with Drupal                                            have different benefits and drawbacks my                                 initiative Drupal                                                initiative is da de my what we do is we                                 tag issues with the ADA my so all issues                                 related to the am I that we know and we                                 identified are tagged with the da mi tag                                 so people can find them and we work                                 directly on the drupal.org issue queue                                 on the Drupal core issue queue and we                                 get we fix stuff issue by issue we                                 actually break down a lot of things too                                 like small small smaller steps like                                 introduce these three special language                                 constants and then we have an issue for                                 exposing them on the interface and then                                 we have an issue for revisiting how it                                 affects existing code and then we have                                 an issue for I don't know what so we                                 break down things into smaller chunks                                 and we get a lot of feedback from people                                 in that way and we get it into Drupal                                 core and why I love this method is                                 because then everybody needs to work                                 with our changes because it's already                                 there and it's commit by committing                                 Drupal core so we use a name that                                 structure tagging because we also use                                 other tags to identify sub initiatives                                 under the initiative so there's all                                 kinds of texts that we use for that                                 there's the meta issues approach that                                 the entity API work uses for example                                 where they have a meta issue that                                 summarizes all the problems and it links                                 up to sub issues and it                                 and it tracked and it gets follower and                                 it gets follows from people and it                                 sometimes posts comments summaries of                                 what happened which is kind of all so                                 good and it also works in the core issue                                 queue and gets commits individually in                                 the core issue queue what the                                 configuration management initiative and                                 the whiskey initiative do is that they                                 have a drupal.org projects and bags for                                 their work and they take Drupal core and                                 then they and then they double around in                                 that they modify all kinds of stuff and                                 discuss their own issues and make their                                 own comets there make their own branches                                 for different approaches so it's a very                                 flexible it allows you to try a lot of                                 things and then when they decide that                                 it's ready for for the people that's not                                 very well visualized here but I actually                                 submit an issue for Drupal core propose                                 it and then it's been and the whole                                 thing as built is discussed there and                                 then if it's okay then it's merged in                                 based on their send documents yes                                 if yes so there there is a merge process                                 and there's a patch process I think cmi                                 the decision my patch use the merge                                 process recently that got in got in I                                 don't know two weeks ago are we go and                                 there's also like summarize patches of                                 all the changes in in one big patch that                                 are submitted in drupal.org issue queue                                 so the benefit of this is that you can                                 play around you can branch to different                                 areas you can experiment with what you                                 want you are not not limited by breaking                                 stuff down and making small changes and                                 then building on your own work because                                 you can experiment whatever you want but                                 the but the inherent problem is that                                 then you need to discuss the whole thing                                 with the rest of the community who was                                 not involved with your work so there's                                 good things in in all the three                                 approaches the four dat mi the structure                                 Italian worked really well I think for                                 the scale of changes required for sea MI                                 and whiskey they could not be able to do                                 that process in any way so if you want                                 to work on Drupal core there's even                                 different models to work on different                                 changes for smaller changes the issues                                 work very well for bigger changes you                                 need to have those discussions and you                                 likely have a sandbox to work on and                                 then when you manage your cell phone                                 through this process you get your patch                                 as our TBC which does not guarantee                                 that's going to be committed it's not                                 very unlikely that is bumping back to                                 any previous state or even this regard                                 it all together as happened quite a few                                 times and even if it's committed                                 sometimes it's rolled back later so so                                 even if it's rtb see you it's means                                 ready to be committed or reviewed and                                 tested by the community depending on how                                 long you are in the Drupal community it                                 meant different things through the life                                 of the world                                 so we viewed and tested by the community                                 is the current version so it just means                                 that the people who looked at it thought                                 that it's good for Drupal core and then                                 there there are a lot of people looking                                 for the Q that has these issues and go                                 there and say okay this is not good this                                 performing well by just reviewing it or                                 it does not match documentation coding                                 standards or whatever it's going to be                                 pushed back in those cases and you go in                                 and fix that and there's also could be                                 any extended time to commit the other                                 issues are processed first so it can                                 take some time but when it's done we                                 reach the party part and and you're and                                 you're there and you contributed to the                                 Drupal community if you want to get                                 started on that and you haven't done it                                 before there's all kinds of sprints                                 tomorrow there's Jess also leads the

                               core development process in a way that I                                  don't think has really been catch light                                  and one place yet                                  I led to say that there is not always I                                  want to contribute by higher than idea                                  it could be also i have development time                                  that i would like to develop our                                  community and one question i I've been                                  trying to do that several times and I ok                                  I'm going to spend one or two hours                                  starting to wear on some issues and the                                  question is where do I start because you                                  start on one topic and you see those                                  huge issue which one android comments on                                  it and you say ok I would spend four                                  hours reading the comment and when I                                  reach the bottom I just have to reload                                  the page and there are                                                   there yes there's a lot of ways to get                                  involved Corps officers is a great way                                  to get issues the pointed at you that                                  would be good for for reviews and might                                  not be that complex there's also the                                  novice tag on drupal.org so you can look                                  at issues tech novice which are there                                  for those who are getting started in the                                  community or only have half an hour to                                  devote right there and they can still                                  contribute at that time and if you want                                  to work on work on any of the big                                  projects I need to have something for                                  you what I did is that I or what not not                                  just what I it is so what the                                  initiatives do for drupal away for                                  example is that they hold meetings every                                  two weeks on IRC so you can go there and                                  you can say you want to get involved in                                  this initiative and then the initiative                                  leak can help find you a task that is                                  good fit for you so I've been tweeting                                  about my initiative and looking for                                  people and also on the IRC meetings I                                  got people and then I kind of had had a                                  site discussion with them one on one                                  what are you interested in what I what                                  are you what's your experience what kind                                  of work you want to do and then I paired                                  them with one or two issues and then try                                  to help them through those issues and                                  try to get them in and it turned out to                                  be very successful for some people which                                  is good so you can go there and and and                                  that's what helped there as well and the

           guess working on development yes so the                                  so i'm not sure people heard the                                  question it was not it was kind of yeah                                  so the question was i haven't mentioned                                  sharks actually and and sometimes issues                                  can get very very hot and intimidating                                  and if i have any suggestions for people                                  who who kind of burn out at that or or                                  or kind of feel I'm multivator by that                                  what I do is that I work on all kinds of                                  things so when something gets very hot                                  and and and people are our Auerbach                                  shedding into death then I can just                                  ignore that and go somewhere else and                                  then do something happy there instead of                                  just going off from Drupal and not doing                                  anything and that maintains my good my                                  good my good mindset because I have                                  success so I go to somewhere else and I                                  maintain the maintain that I'm                                  successful and I'm contributing to                                  Drupal core and I'm and I'm working with                                  people and we are doing good stuff and                                  then I will come back to the other thing                                  later when it winds down if if it does                                  and and then and then try to take it                                  from there so what I try to do is that                                  I'm trying to trying to trying to find                                  other ways to feel successful instead of                                  like trying to get buck down in one                                  thing and then burning and burning down                                  burning out with that and going away                                  are there any plans to improve or any                                  ideas to improve the speed of adding                                  issues discussing issues because last                                  group of six release an issue was added                                  that was talked about nearly two years                                  to get in are there any ideas or plans                                  to improve so the question was whether                                  there's any ideas or plans to improve                                  issue issue time life so again getting                                  his sooner and there was an example of a                                  Drupal                                                                 years and just got fixed Drupal                                       very scary in a way that there is no                                  testing system and there's a huge                                  shortage of people using the development                                  version so I'm very reluctant to commit                                  big or scary-looking changes and even                                  like the RT bcq is growing big in Drupal                                                                                                         testing so I rely on you suffering a                                  little bit before before before we can                                  see that actually worked so we need to                                  have people try and get out and                                  confirming that it worked because we                                  don't have a system to test it and we                                  don't have a system to to verify that it                                  will be good and even then we make                                  mistakes that's like the last Drupal                                    release only fixed two bucks to and both                                  of them were introduced in the previous                                  release okay so we make mistakes but we                                  are humans and so we don't have that                                  testing system we do have a testing                                  system in Drupal                                                      perfect but it speeds up a lot of things                                  and it allowed rupal                                                  bigger changes and and that's part of                                  the reason that we can make even bigger                                  changes into plates so for Drupal                                      don't really have a good solution there                                  unfortunately                                  if there are no other questions then                                  thank you for those who have arrived                                  later I have a handout version you can                                  take this session to home with you so if                                  you don't have a handout you can get you                                  can come forward and get a hand out and                                  walk off with that thank you                                  yes
