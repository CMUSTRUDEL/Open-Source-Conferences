Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: PCI: A FOUR-LETTER WORD OF E-COMMERCE
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a huge, scary set of policies and procedures intended to optimize the security of credit, debit and cash card transactions. When you first get started the idea of becoming (and staying) compliant seems like a Labor of Sisyphus. We know we should comply with the PCI Security Standards, right? But at first glance, it seems like a lot of effort, and confusing to boot. But not only is compliance becoming increasingly important, it may not be the problem you expected. (Then again...) During this session we will briefly go over the PCI-DSS and basic do's and don'ts to get you on your way to PCI Compliance.
