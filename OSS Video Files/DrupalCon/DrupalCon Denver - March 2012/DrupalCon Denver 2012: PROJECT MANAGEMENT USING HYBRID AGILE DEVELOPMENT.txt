Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: PROJECT MANAGEMENT USING HYBRID AGILE DEVELOPMENT
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	Very few shops use the purest version of any project management style. Whether it is Waterfall, Agile, or Cowboy - web development requires flexibility. Waterfall simply doesn't work in most cases -- " fixed scope" is the Holy Grail of project management. Meanwhile, Agile lacks the level of predictability most clients or employers seek. Cowboy is effective in prototyping and extremely rapid development but drives stakeholders crazy. The truth is, project management requires a blend of techniques and tools to effectively shepherd projects from ideation to release. We'll explore and discuss different tools and methodologies that can help make your project successful. Saunders will be premiering this session as one of the keynotes at Drupalcamp Austin. Saunders has worked in project management at a variety of shops ranging from the Western States Arts Federation as Senior Director of Technology, pingVision as Senior Web Producer, one of several Principals in Vintage Digital, and most recently as Director of Technology at Examiner.com. He writes at Dogstar.org regularly - mostly on the business of open source and Drupal. Harrison has developed and produced media, and managed people, and projects at companies such as Disney, Sony, ABC, CBS, Ninth House Network, OpenTV and pingVision. She is now Project Management Director at examiner.com.

                   Saunders I'm the director of technology                                at examiner com and I'm the director of                                project management it's pretty                                self-explanatory examiner is a giant                                Drupal site so for those of you that                                aren't familiar with it when we launched                                it in Drupal we launched with roughly                                nine million nodes and there are                                anywhere between                                                  articles that are published each day and                                then they're associated associated media                                files along with those articles that can                                bring it up to ten twelve thousand new                                nodes that are created each day that                                includes photos videos slideshows all                                all sorts of things like that we use a                                hybrid approach of mysql and mongodb                                which is unusual in the in the Drupal                                world and the reason I'm bringing this                                up we'll make more sense when i get to                                our migration and the approach that we                                took when we migrated from cold fusion                                to to drupal we have multiple web heads                                load balancer we're done                                and failover slave databases the whole                                nine yards it's a it's a pretty big                                affair my role at examiners largely as a                                cat herder as his stacy's and we act as                                a bridge between product and development

trained                                in group facilitation and have a pampy                                so i've been working in drupal since                                    i started in in the web roughly                                         ago originally with a company called the                                western states arts Federation which is                                actually local to denver and i was                                building custom PHP MySQL applications                                for that for that company along the way                                I found Drupal through through a series                                of happy accidents and and that segue                                didn't am i working with company called                                ping vision for two and a half years                                where i was involved in building                                and my grading Oh somewhere in the                                neighborhood of forty or fifty or sixty                                sites I'm not quite sure how many it was                                a lot but that included a number of                                pretty significant migrations that that                                became sort of a basis for the for the                                work that I'm doing now I also work for                                a company called vintage digital LLC                                 which I started with a number of other                                 web developers we've got a number of                                 small to medium sized clients and the                                 most recent was my work with examiner                                 com now with examiner I was hired to                                 come on come on and and help with the                                 migration from cold fusion to Drupal                                   it was a giant job and it was it                                 occurred over oh all told it took                                 probably about                                                         into how that phased we phased through                                 that a little bit in little bit future                                 in the presentation however the                                 interesting thing about it was that                                 Drupal                                                               time and that meant that we were                                 building from basically the the bare                                 bones of what what Drupal                                              in fact our team was responsible for                                 somewhere in the neighborhood of                                 eighteen percent of Drupal core and                                 seven Matthew and I have been working                                 together since ping visions over the                                 last three four years and again together                                 at examiner I've been project managing                                 throughout my career at places like                                 Disney Sony and PDI ninth house it's                                 been a great ride at Drupal all right so                                 if you have any interest in getting in                                 touch with us right quickly because I'm                                 not going to stay on this slide for very                                 long but the long and short is that it's                                 perfectly fine to get in touch with                                 either one of us we're friendly we don't                                 bite at least not very much                                 so I sort of think of myself as a Drupal                                 cuckoo and the reason that I feel that                                 way is that despite the fact that I've                                 been in the web industry now                                         years that's not where my my roots are                                 my roots as I mentioned before was in                                 technical theatre and what what occurred                                 and during that that period of time is                                 happenstance encounters meeting folks in                                 Vancouver becoming more and more                                 interested in Drupal and finally finding                                 my way to a place where i was looking at                                 this community and going okay you guys                                 talking this thing called IRC what is                                 this and and I found myself not quite                                 fitting in but the sweet thing was that                                 I found that the skills that I had from                                 working in the theatre as a stage                                 manager as a lighting designer all those                                 organizational things that I needed to                                 learn in order to do that job well                                 really seg wait amazingly well into into                                 into software development so in                                        was a little bit like a little Cuckoo's                                 egg that had been dropped into a into                                 the nest of a bunch of drupal birds and                                 when I popped out people sort of looked                                 at me and went okay well we'll see what                                 you have to offer now let's tell you                                 this one of the things that occurred was                                 that I found that this community was                                 unbelievably warm and friendly and and                                 and was more than happy to take me under                                 their proverbial wing and help me learn                                 what it meant to be part of the                                 community and since that since then I've                                 got to say that the community has been                                 something that has nourished me both                                 personally and professionally since then                                 so I would encourage you all that as you                                 see new people come into the community                                 please embrace them welcome them take                                 joy in their differences because those                                 differences are things that are going to                                 make us all much much much stronger all                                 right so why do we do what we do so you                                 might find this familiar if you're into                                 science fiction at all and to me this is                                 the                                 emotional state that you find yourself                                 want to client is throwing fits because                                 they know that there's this contrib                                 module that's just right or they know                                 that that something is easy or at least                                 they assume it is they've assume that it                                 won't make that it won't take much time                                 but we all know that that's never true                                 it's the place where you really wonder                                 whether you're ever going to get to                                 build something whether the talking will                                 stop it's the place that you find                                 yourself when the sand is moving under                                 your feet because the scope is changing                                 constantly and you really don't know how                                 to how to get yourself back into a into                                 a strong fundamental place where you can                                 build the site that you've been asked to                                 build it's when you realize that the                                 project state is in constant flux flux                                 and changes the norm and all your                                 predictability has evaporated and to me                                 that's sort of this HP Lovecraft place                                 of the call of da fulu so really our job                                 is to communicate it's to translate it's                                 to mediate our job is to unblock and our                                 job is to take calm and turn it rather                                 take chaos and and turn it into calm                                 it's really to make everyone else's job                                 easier and to simplify the complex if                                 we're being successful there are times                                 when things will appear to be running                                 smoothly you know on their own and it's                                 like what why do we need project                                 managers but don't be fooled we're                                 actually like pedaling madly behind the                                 scenes so we're the cat herders but what                                 we've discovered over the over the last                                 number of years is that you know there's                                 this assumption that we heard the                                 developer cats and the femur cats but                                 it's much more than that we also are the                                 herders of the product owners the                                 business owners clients etc so our job                                 is to continue keeping the communication                                 running keeping those ducks in a row and                                 above all else we have to keep people                                 from seeing that shiny thing that makes                                 them go pull and those things are the                                 things that are going to distract you                                 during your sprint so I'd like to ask                                 folks how many of you in the middle of a                                 coding sprint have had a client or                                 come up to you and say just this one                                 little thing please it can't take that                                 long really come on show of hands how                                 many of you all right so there's this                                 notion that adding this one little thing                                 might make the site so much better and                                 that the lack of discipline of of say of                                 not being able to say you know what                                 let's wait until we're finished this                                 particular sprint is something that's                                 going to is going to cause all sorts of                                 grief for you so all of this requires                                 strong communication across or your                                 company the working unit with your                                 client so I've got another question how                                 many of you know why manhole covers are                                 round and really heavy you right there                                 oh and an deal as de he says that's                                 becomes because that's who won the bid                                 no that's incorrect you right there in                                 the back middle glasses short hair right                                 exactly and that's our job as well we                                 need to be round and heavy and keep                                 people from falling down the hole ninety                                 percent of project management is about                                 communication so not just communicating                                 out but setting up the space and                                 framework that allows the team to most                                 effectively communicate with each other                                 and it's also about really listening                                 listening for any underlying or unspoken                                 message or trend that's that's brewing                                 so what we're going to do now is we're                                 going to talk a little bit about the                                 three different methodologies that                                 examiner's gone through over the last                                 two and a half years that let us started                                 leading as to where we are now and the                                 main reason that we're going to talk                                 about it is because they they've                                 influenced how we've how we've adopted                                 an agile methodology we've learned from                                 each one of them and and how                                 can inform our own method because at the                                 end of the day what what I believe is                                 that there is not notin there is no                                 thing that is pure agile there's no                                 thing that's pure waterfall they're all                                 blended sort of gray areas so the first                                 phase of our development methodologies                                 was cowboy now the reason for that is                                 that when I was brought on board in                                      I was handed a stack of requirements yay                                 ah yay tall and I was told this is what                                 we want you to build so I said okay I                                 need you to leave me alone for a month                                 because I need to get through all of                                 these documents and I'm going to Gantt                                 chart this thing out from the beginning                                 to the end so I so we know what                                 resources we need we know when we need                                 them we know how long it's going to take                                 at the end of it I said hey I've got                                 great news this is an                                                  and we know exactly what we need and                                 when we need it and I was told                                           no no no no you have seven months at                                 which point i sort of blanched and i                                 said well there's only one way I know                                 how to do this because these                                 requirements aren't Drupal e these                                 requirements are highly coldfusion e and                                 they and we're going to be fighting                                 against the the software we're going to                                 be fighting against what the platform                                 does naturally if we if we follow these                                 requirements so what we really need to                                 do is take a look at the goals of the                                 requirements and then you need to allow                                 the the development team to go into                                 rapid iterations where we where we bang                                 through things as quickly as possible                                 and you know the the backend might not                                 look how you expected it because in the                                 old system it was all custom custom cold                                 fusion so we were using as much as much                                 of what Drupal would give us out of the                                 box is humanly possible so this is a                                 highly informal kind of process it                                 focuses on the stakeholders it can be                                 very unpredictable but it can be                                 excellent for for rapid prototyping but                                 it also means that that                                 there is a whole lot of unpredictability                                 for the stakeholders and that's tough                                 for them to take at times so we got                                 through our initial phase and we                                 launched the front end of the system and                                 i think it was eight months so we were                                 all off by about a month but for a                                 project as big as migrating from                                 examiner com from from cold fusion to                                 Drupal                                                                alpha that was a pretty good that was a                                 pretty good effort so the pendulum swung                                 the business wasn't so so happy with the                                 idea of the unpredictability and we went                                 right back into sort of a waterfall kind                                 of kind of place and that gave a whole                                 lot of predictability but the challenge                                 with that was that we weren't being as                                 nimble as the business wanted so we're                                 we were in a constant a constant tension                                 between getting things done quick or                                 being able to plan things out from from                                 from the beginning to the end and and                                 run things through in a in a waterfall                                 kind of fashion and given the fact that                                 examiner tends to be a somewhat somewhat                                 tolerant risk kind of company it it made                                 it kind of kind of rough on everybody so                                 we were constantly getting requests for                                 new things all the time the nice thing                                 about waterfall though is that it is                                 highly formalized it focuses on                                 requirements and it's a little                                 inflexible which is unfortunate but all                                 your planning is front-loaded now I'm                                 going to ask you who here has worked in                                 a waterfall methodology all right                                 another show of hands how many of you                                 have had zero scope scope creep in a                                 waterfall project nobody I'll come on                                 alright so I I would maintain that                                 waterfall in its pure state simply                                 doesn't exist there will always be                                 change requests and the change requests                                 might happen even before your                                 requirements are completed so given the                                 fact that Drupal is always in a state of                                 state of flux you always have new                                 community code that's being released                                 things are changing constantly it seems                                 to me that waterfall isn't necessarily                                 the right methodology to use in a Drupal                                 project because you may well find                                 yourself in a place where a new module                                 is released that's good quality code                                 that does                                                               to have done and that could cut your                                 scope or you might find yourself having                                 problems that you didn't that you didn't                                 anticipate or even worse you might find                                 yourself in a position where a client is                                 asking for for for significant scope                                 change right and so the munch                                 methodology really felt a bit like that                                 can everybody see what those pictures                                 are yeah so we found ourselves in a                                 place where we decided look we have to                                 we have to be more agile and being agile                                 requires that we weave that we move that                                 we're flexible but it also requires that                                 there's a certain amount of                                 predictability within a certain within a                                 certain within a single time box as to                                 what your deliverables are so you're                                 planning you really are planning in a                                 way up front what it is that you're                                 going to do and you do have quite a bit                                 of predictability during that period of                                 time but it's a little bit different                                 than when you're dealing with when                                 you're dealing with a waterfall kind of                                 project so we went into defined time                                 boxes we went into iterative development                                 methods it's incremental we started                                 working in a collaborative way the the                                 development team was was active is                                 active in in helping define how we're                                 going to solve a problem so we're given                                 a business problem and we solve we take                                 our own were owned methodologies and we                                 apply those methodologies to solving                                 that that problem                                 we also have been moved into                                 self-organizing teams and we're trying                                 to be as rapid and flexible and                                 responsive to change is possible now as                                 we get into more of the details on this                                 particular methodology that we've moved                                 into because it is hybrid there is a                                 certain level of inflexibility within                                 the time box and we'll talk a little bit                                 about that as well so our approach that                                 we've come up with to recap what we've                                 discussed so far our phase one was                                 cowboy fast cause problems with                                 expectation gaps between the business                                 and the team it was volatile not much                                 predictability then we moved into Phase                                 two an attempt at waterfall slow change                                 was inevitable often in the middle of                                 the project and requirements often                                 fought with what Drupal does naturally                                 lots of dictating occurred to the                                 development team which made it tough on                                 us because we felt like we had a often                                 had a good solution to a problem and                                 being dictated to how we would solve                                 that problem often made the problem that                                 much more difficult to complete our                                 developers really became order takers                                 and knocked active participants and                                 their creativity was was suppressed                                 quite a bit and it didn't make for a                                 happy situation so then our third phase                                 which we're now going to talk about is                                 the hybrid agile approach that we that                                 we have taken and this is going to be                                 the focus of the rest of the talk now                                 I'll say that we're not going to talk                                 about about the very very very very                                 detailed pieces of this methodology but                                 we'll we'll touch on pretty much                                 everything that we've come to at this                                 point our current unit is comprised of                                 product creative QA and development and                                 you'll see we have a number in each area                                 release management and infrastructure as                                 well the team is both local and                                 distributed we have our main campus in                                 Colorado and we have people in                                 Massachusetts Canada Great Britain                                 hungry we've had the great fortune to                                 work for the exceptionally talented                                 group                                 people but before you know we go into                                 identifying what each of the roles and                                 responsibilities were I just want to                                 talk a bit about what the team's                                 mentality was before we made this big                                 paradigm shift and what it took to pull                                 together and establish and have people                                 accept a new methodology this is you may                                 have seen this light before but really I                                 think it captures kind of how fractured                                 we were you can imagine after the months                                 of stress of these two conflicting                                 approaches there was not a lot of                                 traction there was a lack of trust                                 frustration among the departments this                                 is not a high-functioning team though as                                 I said very talented one of our product                                 managers likes to say the slide is                                 particularly significant because their                                 products not even represented there so                                 some of us were were steeped in agile                                 from previous work others of us has had                                 no exposure whatsoever or where you know                                 committed to waterfall so this was very                                 hard to kind of you know get a kind of                                 uniform thinking around this by in what                                 we needed was breathing room and                                 breathing room is really what's needed                                 to change a fast-paced kind of                                 high-pressure organization that's                                 producing a lot and that's just what our                                 executive team allowed us they were very                                 eager to implement but gave us the                                 permission to jump off the hamster wheel                                 for a minute and just strategize some                                 improvements this is an image from a                                 film called Fitzcarraldo and it's about                                 a guy who hires a crew to move a boat                                 across miles of mountainous jungle                                 terrain and and to me this is an apt                                 metaphor why our task was difficult you                                 know to execute a full-scale site                                 redesign in a very short amount of time                                 that also it also significantly affected                                 our architecture but also the making of                                 the film was about as challenging as the                                 fictional characters experience from                                 what I understand and filmmaking always                                 is and I think it's an interesting study                                 how does a disparate group of eccentric                                 professionals                                 accomplished challenging intricate work                                 with very little sleep and in as little                                 as six weeks without tearing each                                 other's heads off and I'd say first and                                 foremost they're unified behind a                                 singular goal you know make a film move                                 the boat and we had a single goal to                                 stand behind together which was to                                 redesign the site all other projects                                 would and could be deferred and we were                                 given clarity and purpose and the green                                 light to do it in the best way possible                                 and you know normally you don't get that                                 but I think it was really necessary to                                 make a big kind of process shift and                                 when I say us I mean the whole team was                                 involved in in setting up the new                                 process everyone was required to give                                 input and to bring their expertise to                                 the table from the get-go really it was                                 any team based paradigm shift really                                 only works when it has contribution and                                 by in an ownership for the new process                                 and his project managers our job was to                                 set the framework and then allow the                                 team to help organically build upon that                                 framework to support its own needs every                                 team there's no two teams that are alike                                 and projects noted projects that are                                 exactly alike and so really we had to                                 find what was exactly right for us as a                                 project manager moving from waterfall to                                 an agile based process a key paradigm                                 shift is going from a directive style of                                 leadership to that of really primarily                                 facilitation and direction is still                                 necessary but it you really have to                                 become ambidextrous and know when to                                 make that shift and when to apply each                                 style I happen to serve as a group                                 facilitator at juvenile hall in Los                                 Angeles in an earlier life and actually                                 I think that's one of the experiences                                 that helped me the most in in working in                                 the corporate world ironically above all                                 else one really key point that I learned                                 in that process was that when you have a                                 key to conflict management and group                                 problem problem-solving is to you know                                 the tendency is to try to ignore or                                 clamp down on conflicts just suppress                                 them and hope they go away but actually                                 what you need to do is the                                 is it you have to steer into the problem                                 any kind of inkling of dissatisfaction                                 or complaint or cynicism you got to                                 address it head-on not dictatorial e but                                 inquisitively what what's the concern                                 why do others share it how do we resolve                                 it and the catch to all of this was that                                 of course while we were collaborating on                                 process changing and having our kind of                                 group discussions we were already on the                                 clock for delivering an enormous project                                 many of the process improvements had to                                 be done while rushing down this river of                                 an a really aggressive timeline in the                                 book outliers I don't know if you've                                 heard of it with its malcolm gladwell                                 and he points out that you know back in                                 the                                                                    were crashing at a sort of alarming rate                                 and it wasn't because of equipment                                 malfunctions or severe environmental                                 conditions but it's actually due to                                 communications and what they found was                                 that because of the rules of social                                 hierarchy you know pointing to culture                                 some cultural I actually think you know                                 maybe the military pilot culture also                                 affected that first officers and                                 engineers were not at used to speak                                 directly to their captain about their                                 concerns and so you know they were                                 saying things like gee the radar is a                                 very kind of convenient tool isn't it                                 captain I mean just way too subtle and                                 instead of saying look we're about to                                 crash come on you know lift the nose up                                 so planes were actually going down for                                 this reason that people with expertise                                 didn't feel they could advise they                                 weren't speaking up and they couldn't be                                 heard I actually think that's a pretty                                 good metaphor for what we do when we                                 when we execute on very complex projects                                 and we're going at pretty intense speeds                                 a strength of the agile methodology is                                 that while we all have our areas of                                 expertise it's not a hierarchal                                 hierarchical system and frequent                                 feedback is really built in there's                                 scrums you know we had a war room that                                 we used for that project                                 and retrospectives and but beyond that                                 we took extra steps to work to clear                                 communications and really improve them                                 in our new paradigm we worked really                                 hard to eliminate a blame culture to                                 take ownership of mistakes you know and                                 you guys by example but just but just by                                 you know facilitating asking for                                 feedback frequently and of course                                 listening so this is kind of what we                                 arrived at we have our project                                 management team who act as scrum masters                                 they leave it lead on pointing pointing                                 stories and basically moved into a story                                 methodology rather than a strict                                 requirement methodology so we would                                 figure out how long we felt in number of                                 story points how long a certain task                                 would take a big part of our job is to                                 protect the the development team from                                 distracting distractions during the                                 coding phase and it's to ensure that the                                 team doesn't doesn't make mistakes for                                 example saying things like oh that                                 should be easy or I think that that'll                                 be quick we want to avoid that that kind                                 of language because it that does                                 definitely stick into stakeholders                                 brains and you're stuck with that with                                 that perception and finally it was our                                 job to manage the shedule product owns                                 the backlog so all of the all the                                 features that we've been told are                                 important to the company they work on                                 the personas the epics and the stories                                 that that are are being used for a given                                 time box the answer questions clarify                                 business needs and at the end of the                                 time box they're responsible responsible                                 for demoing the software at the end of                                 the spring then the developers are self                                 organizing and and work on the selected                                 stories so in collaboration with the                                 with the management team we'd figure out                                 who would do what but then it was up it                                 was up to the developers to figure out                                 within their own little group who what                                 when why and                                 not why but how and and it was also for                                 our responsibility to decide what can or                                 can't be completed during a during time                                 box and where there's context switching                                 where there's change we're empowered to                                 say look these are the things that that                                 are going to fall out of the current                                 time box because we just don't have the                                 time for it any longer and probably most                                 importantly as the development team is                                 the team that defines the implementation                                 of the business needs and then execute                                 on those on the on that implementation                                 so we've broken the examiner time box up                                 into a sort of a thing that I call                                                                                                             rather right now they product and the                                 creative team are working on writing                                 stories for the next for the next time                                 box so during that                                                       highly active in in figuring out what it                                 is that the personas want out of a given                                 feature days through                                                  story creation wireframes days                                    through                                                            delivery of epics and stories and then                                 on day                                                                time box down at least we try to and the                                 idea of that is that we've got some                                 predictability for the next                                         during the same period of time the exact                                 same period of time the developers and                                 the QA department are executing them                                 what was in the last                                                     in the last                                                            into two days of technical planning ten                                 days of intense coding code sprinting                                 six days of testing and reworking and                                 then we go into deployment and then at                                 the end of it all there's a Drupal day                                 which allows the development team to                                 take what they've worked on genera size                                 that commits it back or work on any                                 other project that they might want to                                 work on the idea though is that that it                                 needs to be part of part of the actual                                 Drupal project and then finally at the                                 end we have a retrospective and that                                 retrospective is critical                                 sit down in a safe environment and we                                 talked about what worked and what didn't                                 work during the time box and then we                                 iterate on the process itself and that's                                 critical to making sure that that you                                 don't fall into a rut and we're very                                 very open and honest as a team about                                 what does work and doesn't work during                                 that period of time and we've also                                 recently added to our process a rapid                                 deployment process which we'll talk                                 about in just a little bit but the the                                 key to this is that the three things                                 overlap we have we have the executive                                 team figuring out what it is that they'd                                 like to see in the next in the next                                    days we have the the product team who                                 are writing the these personas of                                 stories etc for the next time box and we                                 have the actual development for the                                 current time box going on right now and                                 the overlap so it ends up looking a                                 little bit like this                                 right on the last of the time box we                                 also have we have with a company-wide                                 demonstration I know some people stick                                 to just their development or production                                 team but for us the company-wide demo                                 really works and the reasons are that                                 the entire company gets to know what's                                 been developed and you know it sounds                                 simple but it's a kinetic immune                                 occation thing you know what's what's                                 just been done it builds respect and it                                 also helps everyone know how to use the                                 products and who to ask about them if                                 they don't know how to or they have                                 further questions again directly                                 afterwards we do the retrospective                                 meeting and not only does it allow                                 really open feedback and communication                                 about what worked and what didn't but it                                 holds the project managers accountable                                 for fixing problems from time box to                                 time box because otherwise the same                                 points come up and it's a bit                                 embarrassing when you know nothing's                                 been done about the thing that's been                                 brought up several times a little bit                                 about the rapid deploy team now we had                                 feedback that you know once a month for                                 releases was tough for a company web                                 development company that needs to have                                 some quick or turn around and you want                                 to be able to see more frequent releases                                 so what we did was in the last time box                                 implemented a rapid deployed track a                                 specific task force to develop test and                                 release smaller projects quicker                                 turnaround projects and his team would                                 work on a quick quick sprint paradigm                                 attacking a prioritized list that could                                 change depending on the last minute                                 needs of the company and the product                                 lead would actually manage that list how                                 did it go well we hit some bumps the                                 resources from the rest of the time box                                 were pulled off of other projects to                                 work on the rapid deploy team kind of                                 defeating the purpose of you know                                 developing to delineate tracks but you                                 know that's what the retrospective is                                 for we're in the middle of this time box                                 and we will you know make improvements                                 for the next cycle and                                 and this is the great thing about about                                 these cycles is that you can make                                 iterative improvements and have that                                 breathing room to look at those problems                                 so you do use the notion of scrum we do                                 daily scrums and we break our currently                                 we basically have three feature teams                                 and the scrums are broken into into                                 three general questions what did you do                                 in the last                                                             today and what are your blockers we also                                 have bug triage scrums once a week or so                                 to take a look at what bugs have come up                                 during the during the previous time                                 boxes and try to make sure that they're                                 scheduled into into our rapid deploy                                 team work as well so we've got a toolbox                                 and in that toolbox we make use of IRC                                 and skype for for our communication IRC                                 is logged using more of a safe spot just                                 like it is in a lot of other IRC                                 channels so we can go back to any one of                                 our any one of our logged logged                                 conversations and go back and look at                                 what was said this is particularly                                 important in our case because we have a                                 distributed team that pretty much is                                 working                                                                the different places that these folks                                 are working in at one point it was as                                 disparate as as the United States all                                 the way to to to Japan so it really                                 became critical that that people be able                                 to go back and see what was being talked                                 about we also use skype for for voice                                 calls and for screen sharing when we                                 when we need to do screen sharing we are                                 a heavy user of Google Docs what you see                                 here is a picture of what a what our                                 users story document looks like                                 basically it's broken into story ID                                 priority where it lives the story itself                                 notes on it feedback comp whether a comp                                 is you know is needed or not the timing                                 ticket number level of effort leave dev                                 leave the theme irk you a resource                                 product resource etc the reason that you                                 see colors here is because we identify                                 whether whether whether a story is being                                 worked on by putting it yellow if it's                                 completed by putting it green and if                                 it's pink or salmon as we call it there                                 are questions that need to be answered                                 about that particular story this is                                 proven to be a very helpful living                                 document to us and and each time box we                                 create a new one which comprises all the                                 user stories for each of the tracks that                                 we're working on we also use a bunch of                                 other tools for example we use track                                 currently for for our ticketing we are                                 trying to move right now                                               hopper which we feel is going to help us                                 in our in our in our overall reporting                                 we use version control using git                                 deployments are done through scripts                                 that are controlled by Jenkins we do                                 screen shares and screen screen captures                                 using tools like Jing and sketch and                                 ScreenFlow we use Google for managing                                 user stories as I had mentioned and                                 Drupal for logging our IRC channels so                                 by adopting a more agile process what we                                 found ourselves being able to do is                                 deliver working code more quickly we                                 aren't overburdened by specific                                 requirements any longer but focus on                                 business needs and and focus on the                                 notion that the business trusts us to                                 build things the way that they ought to                                 be in a in a way that the software                                 platform most readily will will allow us                                 to work scrums teams deliver product                                 that fits the needs of the business and                                 for us it's taken over two years at this                                 point to get to this point and we                                 continue to shape the process each and                                 every time box by focusing on those                                 lessons that we've learned but ever it                                 seems like each time box things get to                                 get more solid based on the feedback                                 that we get from our team one quick                                 thing about the colors we do have some                                 team members were colorblind so we made                                 a little bit of a mistake with the                                 yellow yellow green so just put some                                 thought into that that's the reason that                                 they're so bright so folks like me that                                 have trouble seeing colors actually can                                 see them the other thing I should say is                                 that the reason it's for us its hybrid                                 is that we don't do all our story                                 building on the first two planning days                                 on the planning days you know there is                                 that                                                                     work with business to really flesh out                                 all of that in advance what have we                                 built using our methodology among many                                 other projects many other small ones                                 we've at the site redesign was                                 successful we actually ended up                                 releasing it was six weeks ahead of time                                 the largest Drupal mobile site in                                 existence currently is spearheaded by                                 Richard burford over here we did we                                 release that in January a complex                                 behaviorally based rewards program for                                 our                                                                   released next week and I would just say                                 that our team which has always been very                                 talented is now just a really high                                 performing team there's a lot of                                 camaraderie and just a lot of                                 understanding the miscommunications that                                 we had in the past just don't happen in                                 the same way so i would say that we're                                 faster better and more awesome all right                                 so what we'd like to do is open up the                                 floor to questions                                 all right looking at your guys's process                                 I noticed you're starting with the user                                 stories moving into development and then                                 finishing off with testing had you guys                                 tried a test driven approach where you                                 write the test prior to it to avoid                                 rework to fix changes so there are two                                 sort of different ways that tests are                                 dealt with in our team the first is                                 tests they're written by the developers                                 themselves to test their their own code                                 and there are roughly roughly                                          those tests now that run on our on our                                 testing environment each evening                                 automatically so we know if things have                                 broken existing functionality from a                                 standpoint of the tests of the the the                                 browser-based tests those are generally                                 written after the user stories are are                                 developed however I think that one of                                 the one of the imperatives that we found                                 that we need to move into is having                                 those those particular browser based                                 tests written at the same time as the                                 stories so it's something that we're                                 working on right now as a suggestion our                                 company uses selenium to do that and                                 when dry very familiar found that very                                 helpful so cool thanks I would also say                                 that we we do as soon as the code is                                 written and push to staging it and the                                 QA team can get to it they'll get to it                                 it's not just isolated by that time box                                 if that's part of your question all                                 right or this hi I'm Shannon from blue                                 spark labs and I had a question about                                 how you are explaining your process to                                 clients especially in a world of fixed                                 bid where so many clients just don't                                 understand the idea of we're going to                                 pull things into time boxing and                                 sprinting and we'll get through what we                                 can using this kind of agile hybrid                                 methodology and I'm wondering how you                                 explain that to them in a way that they                                 can understand and accept and not feel                                 insecure about like they're going to get                                 screwed over my clients are the                                 executive are the executive team of                                 examiner com we don't have we don't have                                 exterior clients                                 so the examiner site is a is a giant                                 giant journalist kind of site citizen                                 journalist kind of site that that is the                                 revenue model is actually advertising so                                 it's a little bit different than than                                 being an agency land I will say though                                 that that took a certain amount of                                 socializing to you know to get to the                                 point where you know time box huh you                                 know it's interesting because you know                                 we were we actually found it to be one                                 of the big selling points was that once                                 we got a handle on our burn rate it was                                 pretty easy to say you know very likely                                 probably good ninety-five percent you're                                 going to get X amount of done by this                                 date it was much more predictable for                                 them so the executives actually really                                 appreciate that that structure now that                                  the vernacular has become more                                  comfortable but i will say that in                                  previous lives where I've worked in in                                  an agency that's a huge challenge for                                  sure it's it's tough and you know                                  there's a variety of different levels of                                  appetite for that ranging from people                                  who really get it to those that want to                                  fix bit I get it it's tough hi I'm                                  vitaly with work or have a question                                  about a heavy rubber face situation when                                  you had to do replace team member during                                  sprint or time box and if so do have any                                  instant standard workflow to approach                                  this situation for replacing a developer                                  for example yeah yeah we've had a number                                  of situations where team member has had                                  to leave for one reason or another in                                  the middle of a time box it's tough and                                  I actually think that the biggest part                                  of it for us is identifying that risk to                                  our executive team when the risk occurs                                  because really what that means is during                                  that period of time our burn rate has                                  reduced and it means that things that                                  we've thought that we're going to be                                  able to                                  get done we we haven't been able to                                  complete so basically its extensive                                  scope for next sprint or you need to                                  move yeah and we actually built in some                                  you know for risk management a certain                                  number of points toward you know                                  interpret unpredictability and that's                                  included I noticed on your team lay out                                  there you have for the-- murs and nine                                  developers I'm just wondering how you                                  distinguish between theme errs and                                  developers they seem very similar to me                                  yeah they are there similar that said                                  that in terms of our particular team are                                  our femurs a good chunk of them are                                  highly trained also in design but that                                  said our our site isn't like a lot of                                  Drupal sites it's it's very complex in                                  the back end and and we're running crazy                                  queries against DB which isn't a                                  standard database for for for drupal so                                  our back-end developers almost almost                                  almost never touch the theme our                                  front-end developers are focused heavily                                  on the theme and our light into the into                                  the backend kind of kind of work but                                  it's the difference between back-end                                  work and theme layer work hi I'm Justin                                  from the street it's really interesting                                  because you guys have a really similar                                  model to what we do at the street with                                  separate development teams are you know                                  truly agile I'm interested in what you                                  guys call your rapid deploy team because                                  we do something similar and I'm                                  wondering if if you guys are collecting                                  stories for that group the same way                                  you're doing it for all your projects                                  through google docs or versus like a                                  Kanban style you know something a little                                  more quicker yet we don't really use                                  Kanban but we do collect our stories in                                  a very very similar way for for our                                  regular projects sometimes those stories                                  will be written in the middle of a time                                  box style and it's interesting you                                  should mention that one of our product                                  managers with is working toward building                                  out a con been bored just because I                                  think it's really conducive to the rapid                                  deploy yeah since you mentioned                                  and I couldn't recommend more the green                                  hopper plugin for jira it's probably the                                  best thing about there yeah we're                                  looking forward to that hi um two                                  questions the first one probably really                                  simple why drupal                                                       it was it unstable what was so important                                  I'm just curious because we're not um no                                  we good chunk of our of our development                                  team core developers and there was a                                  desire to have as long a leg if you will                                  for the for the product once it was once                                  it was delivered and then add on top of                                  that the performance issues that that we                                  knew that we were going to have to                                  overcome because of the size of the site                                  the amount of traffic that came to the                                  site it became clear that we needed to                                  use or desired not necessarily needed                                  but desired to use a database that was                                  going to be more performant than mysql                                  and and it was it was obvious at the                                  time that even in its infancy drupal                                    was going to handle that a whole lot                                  better than drupal                                                   thing is how involved with the                                  developers or how much do they know                                  what's coming in the next time box                                  pretty involved when they finished their                                  when they finish their their development                                  during the Sprint they're actually                                  sitting down with with product and                                  project managers and reviewing reviewing                                  the stories for the next for the next                                  time box I will say that's a challenge                                  because when the developers in their                                  coding phase we don't we want them to be                                  uninterruptedly as the technology                                  director he will cover that portion but                                  we'll try to pull the development leads                                  on a project as quickly as early as                                  possible to get them involved hi John                                  Reynolds Martha Stewart Living I've got                                  a question about how you turn user                                  stories in the technical tasks point of                                  friction we often have is the user story                                  will be get way too many technical tasks                                  and we start to wonder is it more than                                  one user story and I noticed on your on                                  your spreadsheet you actually had a                                  ticket number column suggesting that you                                  had one ticket I presume attract ticket                                  per user story for us                                  we usually will end up with possibly a                                  dozen technical task map to a user story                                  I was wondering how you manage that so                                  the ticket number that you saw is a                                  ticket number for a parent ticket and                                  and that parent ticket then becomes the                                  umbrella for a bunch of technical tasks                                  and you're absolutely right we have the                                  very same challenges of trying to of try                                  of trying to match user stories to                                  technical tasks that said what we found                                  is that for our product team to be able                                  to express what it is that they want a                                  persona to be able to do or experience                                  using the user stories has made that                                  much much clearer and and more efficient                                  for us yeah Dunley a challenge you know                                  they're different needs the user stories                                  has a different use for each different                                  group in particular QA needs a sort of                                  more broken down user story almost you                                  know my new show where as the developers                                  you know they have a better experience                                  and they can be freer to develop and be                                  creative when they have a more general                                  user story so we're experimenting with                                  that from time boxed upon tyne box it                                  depends on the project as well with the                                  rewards project that was so intricate                                  and there was just really specific                                  infrastructure that had to be a late in                                  place we had some you know                                           stories for for that and you know people                                  weren't developers weren't happy we'll                                  move back to we'll swing back on the                                  other end of the pendulum thank you all                                  right I think we've got time for maybe                                  two more questions then everybody's                                  going to want to run to the plenary                                  right currently in my agency we you know                                  we have our war room we have our scrum                                  board and we have a fairly large                                  distributed team there any tools that                                  you would recommend for the distributed                                  team to use as a scrum board Wow so                                  we're moving to one of the reasons that                                  we're moving to giro with greenhopper is                                  because it has an integrated scrum board                                  into it greenhopper does and allows you                                  to define your workflows specifically to                                  your to your groups needs and you can                                  drag your your                                  you're scrum tickets from one one                                  portion of the board to the next portion                                  of the board to to move through the                                  through the through that process I've                                  also used a product called tingle which                                  is which is another agile scrum tool                                  that specifically it's not a ticketing                                  tool so much as a as a scrum board tool                                  and it works pretty well as well but                                  JIRA with greenhopper I think as they is                                  for us at least is going to be the                                  answer to that yeah Tom whole project                                  manager at Emma Dex media my question is                                  I think a number of the audience here                                  works for agencies or as a freelancer                                  what are the most important skill sets                                  you as a project manager working for                                  that environment versus for like                                  examiner com where your client is the                                  executive team what do you think the                                  difference in terms of skill sets are                                  for project management and what are the                                  you know the same things I actually                                  think that there isn't that much of a                                  difference in terms of the skill sets                                  one of the things that that you need to                                  be aware of between working in agency                                  and and working for for a company like                                  say examiner or something like that is                                  that when you're doing your you're                                  budgeting the budgeting is going to be a                                  little bit different for example if a                                  project when you're when you're taking a                                  look at but you're the budgeting your                                  time you're not assessing you're not                                  assessing an hourly rate to the                                  budgeting of the time you know that                                  you've got X number of hours per time                                  box that you can use for theming and for                                  development and for infrastructure stuff                                  and so forth and because you're not                                  billing directly against that it changes                                  that paradigm a little bit but the core                                  skill set I think is pretty much                                  identical alright thanks so much                                  everybody for coming to our presentation                                  you
