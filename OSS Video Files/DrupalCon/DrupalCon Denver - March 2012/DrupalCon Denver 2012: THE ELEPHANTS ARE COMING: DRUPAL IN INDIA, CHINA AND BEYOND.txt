Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: THE ELEPHANTS ARE COMING: DRUPAL IN INDIA, CHINA AND BEYOND
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	Drupal has thus far been primarily successful in North America and Europe, but this is changing quickly. Worldwide enterprise companies such as Accenture, Cap Gemini and Cognizant are building Drupal practices and staffing offices in India. In addition, their Indian counterparts such as Tata Consulting Services, HCL and Infosys are entering the fray. What does this mean for Drupal? Is it possible that by 2015 (or sooner), the majority of Drupal development will be happening in India or China? As a long-time resident of India, I have witnessed (and encouraged) this growth. I am still looking for someone to co-present on China, Eastern Europe or other emerging Drupal markets. Other presenters:
