Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: THE ELEPHANTS ARE COMING: DRUPAL IN INDIA, CHINA AND BEYOND
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	Drupal has thus far been primarily successful in North America and Europe, but this is changing quickly. Worldwide enterprise companies such as Accenture, Cap Gemini and Cognizant are building Drupal practices and staffing offices in India. In addition, their Indian counterparts such as Tata Consulting Services, HCL and Infosys are entering the fray. What does this mean for Drupal? Is it possible that by 2015 (or sooner), the majority of Drupal development will be happening in India or China? As a long-time resident of India, I have witnessed (and encouraged) this growth. I am still looking for someone to co-present on China, Eastern Europe or other emerging Drupal markets. Other presenters:

	                              hey so um it's time to start we got a                               pretty small crowd in a big room do you                               guys just want to come forward and maybe                               we'll make it less for presentation more                               of a discussion may I present my stuff                               and we can talk some anyone wants to                               show up who's come here and then I'll                               spend about                                                           I know and then we can maybe open it up                                and make it a little more of a                                discussion and find out what you want to                                know it's that work for everyone I just                                don't like giving a big presentation to                                a small group it's not real energy you                                know it's better to make a discussion                                I'd rather just talk to you all anyway                                so if you want to make your way up                                that'd be great and we'll get started in                                a minute I'm Jacob by the way this is                                fernando this is chun this is yaakov                                Sookie they're all come to help me out                                and give their opinions in different                                parts of the world and their stories and                                so we'll get to that in a second but                                instead of a full introduction I                                actually want to start with a question                                this is sort of like a game show it's                                like a game show but there's no prizes                                so but it's pretend there's a prize okay                                what country has the most visitors to                                drupal.org really this is not a trick                                question yeah so it looks something like                                this this is business to drupal org                                shaded by the number of visits you can                                see the u.s. sort of washes out                                everything else on the map for the most                                part India is there but this is pretty                                dark USS I think somewhere close to                                forty percent something of the traffic                                in the world okay well so be a little                                harder one which country are the largest                                growth and visitors from                                               any other guesses no the small country                                oops oh no I think my thing I think                                keynote just didn't wasn't happy for a                                minute let me see if it works now sorry                                I will have to restart because I think                                you know it said some error like                                something has gone wrong restart kino                                and I think I'm not gonna restart                                keynote right now and it look he went                                wrong so images aren't showing up you in                                a second yes North Korea grew by two                                thousand one hundred and seventy-five                                percent last year of course you know it                                grew from what like five users to like                                                                                                     doesn't really count let me just pull                                this back up one second and I'm sending                                a very angry letter to what's-his-name                                Tim Cook Apple I don't know about the                                quality of their presentation software                                hold on one second put back up again I                                can you open office yeah I've been that                                was a linux user for for too many years                                I've configured my soundcard my graphics                                driver by hand too many times to count                                okay let's see if we're better now okay                                yeah North Korea so North Korea grew by                                about                                                                  I'm going to talk to you about the                                differences between numbers and growth                                and this presentation is mostly data and                                I know like I'm not going to bore you                                for an hour I know that the average                                person can listen to someone talk even                                someone is training for                                               the average person with an iphone can                                listen for about two minutes and you all                                have iphones so i'm going to be quick                                and I don't pretend to know everything                                about the whole world and why the                                reasons everything happens in the world                                so what I did instead as I crunched a                                lot of numbers and I did I did a lot of                                analysis and I'm present the data to you                                and hopefully you can make your own                                conclusions from that then I'm going to                                talk to you a little bit about a survey                                i did and what other people in the world                                say is going on and then i'm going to                                tell you a couple stories are in india                                which is a country I know pretty well                                okay then we're gonna open up and these                                guys are going to chat we can all hear                                from you sounds like a deal just                                   minutes I can take an hour okay so like                                I said this is this is                                the if I map just the sheer growth North                                 Korea just takes out everything on the                                 map that's kind of cheating let's look                                 at the top                                                             countries which have the most visitors                                 to drupal.org the top                                               shaded by by growth for                                                grow the number of visitors is that                                 surprising at all to anyone Africa all                                 over the place right darkish countries                                 are in Africa Latin America Asia Kazakh                                 Stan Pakistan right it's not the                                 traditional places that you think of                                 where most of the action and Drupal                                 happens but this is where the growth is                                 happening it may not be the sheer                                 numbers but it's where the growth is                                 happening missing it's not very dark                                 yeah it you know also there's a thing                                 about market saturation so like trying                                 to add a lot of growth year before and                                 whatever but now it's okay more trivia                                 which region had the highest growth and                                 visitors do you think from                                              prizes just maybe a round of applause if                                 you're right Middle East no Africa                                 Africa is too big east africa actually                                 east africa grew by sixty sixty nine                                 percent or whatever sixty-five percent                                 last year terms of visits drupal.org we                                 each turn africa western Africa Central                                 Asia southern Asia melanesia it goes                                 down notice something there's no North                                 America there's no Europe right this is                                 where the growth is happening right now                                 in terms of people coming to drupal.org                                 and visiting these aren't small numbers                                 they're not insignificant like North                                 Korea numbers they're actually pretty                                 big numbers but that's just traffic so                                 that tells us how many people come to                                 this website what about engagement how                                 do we measure engagement how do we know                                 that maybe people are visiting but                                 they're not really engaged in the                                 community I think is a perception right                                 that most of the community participation                                 is happening in Europe in North America                                 even if traffic maybe elsewhere is that                                 a perception that you hear a lot I hear                                 that often I think that we look at                                 drupalcon presenters they're not very                                 representative demographically of where                                 the visitors are coming yeah                                 so I got ahold of all the data from                                 groups drupal org is anyone here visit                                 groups a triple org so you so does                                 everyone know know what it is no some                                 people no no okay I'll tell you it is so                                 a group cyborg it's a site where people                                 come in and they discuss whatever it's a                                 place for people to organize themselves                                 in the community and a lot of the groups                                 are regional right so like there's a                                 Boston group and it's a new york group                                 as a den berg group people come and they                                 meet and they talk and so i got all the                                 data for the last four years everyone                                 who's registered become a member of any                                 regional group and i've plotted that on                                 a map I got the countries that came from                                 and so of groups these are the total                                 members of groups per country so this is                                 a sign of engagement this is people who                                 not just looking at the website but are                                 contributing as part of a community you                                 can see the United States is pretty dark                                 but so is India so is Brazil so as                                 Canada most of Western Europe is very                                 dark Australia is very dark this is                                 where we could say that the most members                                 of groups who are engaged are in these                                 countries but that's just the sheer                                 numbers as I said before we have to look                                 at the growth because if we're if we're                                 looking at numbers the whole point is to                                 what's going to happen not what happened                                 so let's look at the growth a little bit                                 I think it might surprise you okay more                                 trivia these two countries have more                                 than doubled in groups at drupal.org                                 members every year for the last three                                 years any guesses china and india much                                 more humble countries smaller what's                                 that I Rica's Ecuador in costa rica                                 there's the only countries are doubled                                 in growth every year another one the                                 only country to grow faster to increased                                 its rate of growth every year from                                                                                                          people who try harder that's actually                                 spain spain is the only country to                                 accelerate growth every year it's grown                                 incredibly fast so looking at growth                                 this is in                                                         really big year for Drupal I think                                 that's one when we really exploded and a                                 lot of a lot of big things happened and                                 this shows I'm gonna take a minute to                                 describe the                                 the map so you can get a sense of it and                                 then we'll look with data the dark the                                 dark blue it's almost black on this is                                                                                                    members of groups in that country grew                                 by four times that year greater than                                 four times the sort of normal blue color                                 is to time                                                              color means it less than doubled less                                 than twice growth and so you can see on                                 this map there was massive growth this                                 year there's a lot of dark spots like                                 Brazil Mexico but even the u.s. grew by                                 like                                                                  it's a lot right three times as many                                 people became engaged the community that                                 were there the year before now let's                                 look at that over the next                                           this is                                                             these are the countries which                                 experienced the most growth you notice                                 it's one of the countries we see here                                 somalia mongolia Kazakh Stan right                                 Angola it's it's not really what we'd                                 expect at all right and so that's what                                 we're saying the massive growth and                                 engagement this is perception that                                 engagement isn't happening a lot these                                 other countries but in fact it is and                                 it's growing faster than anywhere else                                 in the world in fact to illustrate it                                 I'm going to say okay can you guess                                 which continent added the most countries                                 Judeo in                                                               had more countries come on board as                                 community members Africa by far                                       them                                                                    from Latin America for from Asia a three                                 from Europe and you could say this is                                 partially about market saturation but                                 this this map shows you these are all                                 the countries which had at least one                                 group in                                                            countries which have at least one group                                 in                                                                      all over Africa and Central Asia and                                 this is where we see a lot of growth                                 it's not necessarily representative                                 though of the people you see in the                                 community or what you assume is                                 happening and I'm curious why that is I                                 don't have a good answer as I said I sep                                 data you can make your own conclusions                                 about that data                                 okay more trivia even guess three                                 countries whose member growth increased                                 by                                                                       members Mongolia and Nigeria and Liberia                                 amazing like I think Nigeria went from                                 third like was it five members to                                       members last year I don't know that                                 happens as I said all i have is data                                 here's a here's one that is a little bit                                 of a downer but it's good to know of the                                                                                                       year how many were in North America or                                 Europe                                                                   know that eventually everything every                                 every market saturates at a certain                                 point and the growth is still very good                                 in Drupal it's not like we're declining                                 but we're not growing as fast you're                                 upon year the growth is slowing year                                 after year in the traditional areas                                 where Drupal's been really strong and                                 its really growing in these other                                 countries that we don't know enough                                 about yet and so I started seeing this                                 trend I think about a year ago and I                                 thought about doing this talk of the                                 things and I put together a survey this                                 fall ala Drupal and emerging market                                 survey and I sent it out and asked                                 people some questions about the Drupal                                 economy in their area the the challenges                                 the opportunities just what was going on                                 I didn't get a lot of responses so you                                 can't consider this very authoritative                                 data we had                                                        countries non you're up non-us i                                 published the data there you can find                                 the slides later if you want d survey if                                 you're mostly the raw data i'm going to                                 share a couple highlights though i think                                 they're interesting one of the questions                                 I asked was what are the biggest                                 challenges for you and the biggest                                 challenge is by far our ability of                                 skilled employees lack of training                                 opportunities and what we call attrition                                 or turnover people leaving their jobs                                 too soon and these are pretty much all                                 the same thing right that they have so                                 much growth that they can't hire good                                 people and keep them long enough to                                 deliver on projects that they're just                                 they don't no problem selling it they                                 don't have problem charging money they                                 don't no problem marketing the biggest                                 infrastructure surprisingly was not a                                 big problem for most people                                 but they have a problem retaining talent                                 and growing talent which is kind of the                                 same problem we have here I think on the                                 other side opportunities opportunities                                 people voted on mobile was by far the                                 top opportunity everyone considered a                                 big opportunity there was nobody who                                 said it wasn't an opportunity training                                 curriculum was second that was heavy                                 which corresponds to the challenges we                                 saw in the slide before and high                                 performance consulting that being a                                 major need that's unfilled in those                                 communities again I don't have I don't                                 have conclusions for the whole world but                                 this is the data in other questions I                                 asked for about the Drupal community so                                 I asked how people agree with this                                 statement people from my region are                                 adequately represented at global Drupal                                 events this is the one with the                                 strongest disagreement it was pretty                                 clear that there is a lack of diversity                                 at drupalcon in terms of our speakers                                 are leaders and this has a negative                                 effect in terms of not providing role                                 models for people to follow not                                 providing a an opportunity for growth                                 and access to that I think that's                                 something we should pay attention to and                                 as a community be more aware of be more                                 proactive about the other one the drupal                                 association has adequately involved my                                 region very strong disagreement with                                 this I think there's a lot of desire                                 from around the world for the drupal                                 association to focus more outside of                                 north america and western europe and i                                 don't think to date drupal association                                 has done a lot I know it's on Jacobs                                 agenda and there's probably a drupalcon                                 happening in Latin America soon and it                                 will happen but I think that's a need                                 that people are saying hey we have this                                 business we have we have real money                                 coming in we have real people working                                 and we want like more investment in                                 building this community so that we can                                 hire people and build a community to                                 deliver so that's the data have from the                                 survey and yeah I don't know any                                 questions about that before I go on you                                 can talk about it or small enough group                                 I don't have a graph so I did ask that                                 question on the survey I said estimate                                 decide the Drupal economy and like how                                 much does the average developer make how                                 much there's a project I have data on                                 that but I felt like because the numbers                                 were so small I wouldn't want a present                                 on that I think the opportunities and                                 challenges would be the same if you had                                 a thousand respondents or                                             might be a little different so overall                                 it's very strong like I said there's                                 there's I don't know anyone who has more                                 supply than demand in terms of Drupal                                 developers so I think that's not a                                 problem for anyone so other thing that                                 was interesting my did a little research                                 is what's driving a lot of this growth                                 and one of the one of the key things I                                 think is government is big like India as                                 government mandate for open source                                 Brazil as a government mandate from open                                 source I think something like                                    countries worldwide have a mandate but                                 the half to implement open source                                 solutions were ever possible so I think                                 that's also driving a lot of the growth                                 I want to talk to about actually                                 something else I went to India I                                 actually I'll it so I didn't really                                 juice myself I'm Jacob saying and I i                                 worked for ah quia i designed a lot of                                 our training programs there now but I                                 lived in India for about six years in                                 two different stints I got hired back                                 when i was living in india so i spent a                                 lot of time in delhi and i'm connected                                 with the community there and what                                 they're doing and so in November dreese                                 and I and our head of marketing went off                                 to India and went to three cities so oh                                 wait before I go there actually the                                 reason we went to India is that India                                 grew by fifty percent in draft traffic                                 to drupal org last year massive growth                                 is the second largest country in terms                                 of visitors in the world it surpassed                                 the UK surpassed france and germany lots                                 of other ones to pass brazil and so                                 obviously seem like there's lots of                                 happening we should find out what it is                                 so we went to three different cities in                                 a week it was a week it's like four days                                 it was ridiculous we were in New Delhi                                 then we went to Mumbai and then to                                 Hyderabad and at each at each city there                                 was a drupalcamp that was organized and                                 we had like is anyone here ever                                 organized a camp                                 yeah and how long I know you did you                                 organize this one how long did it take                                 to set up a dribble camp like how long                                 did it take you to organize it yeah yeah                                 you start talking about six months in                                 the last couple months are like heavy                                 duty in the old days two weeks was                                 easier now that there's an expectation                                 of sponsors and food and all these                                 things it's a little harder they had                                 like a month's notice and each place                                 organized a full-on professional                                 drupalcamp of sponsors and food and                                 speakers and the whole nine t-shirts and                                 what have you and in Delhi we showed up                                 expecting that we would be like and this                                 is totally organic we didn't say do this                                 people just said oh dress is coming                                 let's make it happen and you know we                                 showed up and there was                                               Delhi there was this contrast is awful                                 there was a you know I think                                        mumbai                                                                  engaged very excited it was kind of                                 weird people were asking grease like                                 sign the back of their shirts and stuff                                 like they're asking me to sign their                                 shirts like I'm not even I'm like not                                 even Therese anyway and they couldn't                                 understand what Reese was saying I think                                 a lot of the time I socially publishing                                 but you know people loved it and you                                 know it was inspiring to see it felt                                 like the old days of Drupal it felt like                                 I've been around for like six years and                                 it felt like those old days where there                                 was a lot of enthusiasm around open                                 source software it wasn't just about                                 business and money yet it was about a                                 lot of other things too and a great                                 community and really great feeling so in                                 every every city we had one of these                                 drupal camps we had like discussions so                                 we met with people in the community                                 academic leaders you know governmental                                 leaders open source software advocates                                 and talked about drupal's place in that                                 ecosystem we also met with the press so                                 there was a particle published dr. Dre                                 of the internet which I helped write                                 several of Drusus articles for that                                 thing so we made a lot of we interviewed                                 with a lot of journalists and we did a                                 whole PR thing and that was great like                                 it was pretty amazing actually we had a                                 lot of journalists show up a lot of                                 articles public                                 at least half a dozen some really good                                 ones and so we did we did that to                                 promote things and then we also met with                                 the big system integrators so that would                                 be like capgemini and Accenture and                                 cognizant and people like that miss his                                 boss on the top and we collected a lot                                 of business cards yeah she's your voz'mi                                 not the CEO of of droop of capgemini                                 india when that was kind of shocking                                 because i don't have any of you ever                                 worked in like big IT like Accenture                                 type companies IBM a couple of you and                                 you know like what they do right they                                 have partnerships with mostly                                 proprietary vendors many multi-billion                                 dollar deals or SAP and Oracle a nice                                 people and they go and sell those their                                 clients to implement them and we're like                                 so dinky as much as we think we're huge                                 to those guys were nothing we're like                                 they always have this this slide deck                                 they show you when you come in like all                                 right this is the vendors we work with                                 and there's like SI p and oracle and                                 microsoft and at the bottom it curable                                 you know like to point font at the                                 bottom of the thing and so we kind of                                 expected that treatment but it was                                 amazing we showed up to meet capgemini                                 we were delayed twice we were stuck in                                 traffic we were like half an hour late                                 and they flew in three vice-presidents                                 and the CEO showed up and she knew about                                 like the major triple websites she knew                                 about some of the major firms in Drupal                                 she actually tried it out I mean she                                 manages                                                               that there's actually something really                                 big going on here this is not we didn't                                 we didn't expect that and time we met                                 with Accenture we met with VIP bro we                                 found a similar story at all these                                 places they're building huge Drupal                                 teams and a lot of the biggest sites in                                 the world that we know of are being                                 delivered by these guys in India we a                                 lot of the ones we thought were                                 delivered by US firms were actually                                 delivered in India things and we were so                                 shocked that why didn't we know this                                 this is like we rock we are this is                                 Greece why didn't we know this is                                 happening they have a hundred person                                 team at capgemini in india of drip lists                                 so that was pretty eye-opening and it                                 showed me that a lot of big things are                                 happening it's quite possible that the                                 majority of Drupal developers in a few                                 years will actually be in India and                                 China and not in the United States at                                 all                                 so and especially as we grow as a                                 community as we do bigger and bigger                                 projects those huge companies they                                 consult with these folks they don't mean                                 as cool as aqua or phase two or whatever                                 al all about is they don't hire those                                 kind of companies they hire these guys                                 so it's really important that for us to                                 succeed we make sure that those                                 companies are capable of delivering                                 quality so that we don't have a you know                                 we don't have a massive property sort of                                 fail on us so that was that was great                                 and it was nice to that validation that                                 like sort of we made it and get wined                                 and dined by corporate folks and                                 whatever but the best that actually the                                 best experience was meeting all of the                                 people who were involved knee open                                 source community there we're passionate                                 about it and I want to talk to you for a                                 minute introduce you to one of them her                                 name was Priscilla and she works for                                 company called Audrey solutions Mohan is                                 the something of Audrey you this buddy                                 the boss the big boss no he's one of the                                 boss he's one of the co-founders of                                 advisory a very cool shop in in                                 hyderabad and bangalore and they do they                                 do open source software delivery and                                 they primarily do drupal now before Joel                                 I started with them about six years ago                                 she's from a pretty small town in the                                 country you know and she she went to an                                 engineering college that had a specific                                 unique program that introduced her to                                 open source you look at the in India                                 ninety percent of people graduate for                                 the engineering degrees they study Java                                 and.net there is no open-source                                 curriculum really it's very very very                                 very rare and so that's a big part of                                 the talent problem it's not that there                                 aren't jobs not they don't pay well is                                 that the the people aren't willing to go                                 for those jobs there's an aspirational                                 piece of it which says if i do drupal                                 it's not as good a name as java fern to                                 that but she's a unique experience and                                 she didn't she decided to go sort of                                 less-traveled path and as a result of it                                 she's built international conferences                                 she's been to do drupal cons and she's                                 produced some really amazing code and                                 she's also contributed back to the                                 community and so I thought it'd be fun                                 to talk to her a bit and we got a little                                 video you can maybe meet her yourself                                 because she'll tell her story better                                 than I will so here's Pudge Ola if my                                 uh oh no keynote you did it again all                                 right i'm going

work with the developer from raising he                                 told me how to use a shawl borough to                                 learn more and he totaled that sort to                                 learn more have to contribute                                 at first I forget it but I know really                                 definitely saving enough I want to have                                 the feeling continuously then now I it                                 is it is about the self-satisfaction                                 I'll posters for later because I don't                                 think it's very audible so sorry that                                 are a big I did a check but I guess yes                                 I'll give you a good jest ok I want to                                 give it as well as she did I think her                                 her main point was that you know when                                 she when she was involved in her college                                 in India it's very common there's a                                 thing about net fishing they were heard                                 that expression as related to IT so like                                 a company like the pro Infosys or                                 capgemini huge companies they'll come in                                 and they'll hire                                                      college without even like interviewing                                 them barely and then they'll like sort                                 of see the                                                             keep them and everyone and like another                                 couple hundred will sit on the bench and                                 do nothing and the rest will get sacked                                 and they'll go on to do it again this is                                 traditionally how big IT kind of works                                 and it's not a great system in my                                 opinion but they have it down to a                                 science and so there's a lot of I would                                 say this is a expression a lot of uh no                                 no I'm the only Indians in the audience                                 will get it but there's an expression                                 I've heard called me we have test driven                                 development and software and in India                                 you have a lot of shoddy driven                                 development or you have people who like                                 they join because shoddy means marriage                                 so it's about like it's a perception                                 that if I join a prestigious company                                 like an accenture will have more respect                                 more recognition and and so you know                                 with Petula she was part of that group                                 and she was the one who got away she was                                 the one who said I'm we do something                                 different and all of her                                 her bathroom it's all people she went to                                 school with are sitting on the bench or                                 their sacks from those companies or                                 they're going nowhere in their careers                                 and she's been extremely successful and                                 driven and made those decisions to do                                 that and take less beaten path and it's                                 made her very happy and she's sort of                                 wants to encourage that and encourage                                 that it's a new world now and that's not                                 an unsafe thing to do you can probably                                 become an expert faster in Drupal world                                 recognized expert in Drupal and a couple                                 of years if you really apply yourself                                 and if you want to come old recognized                                 expert in Java how long will that take                                 you like your whole life and you won't                                 even be there you'll take training                                 courses and certifications and so that's                                 been a big piece of her success and the                                 other the other piece she's mentioning                                 is that she learned and she got good at                                 what she does by interacting with the                                 community and by giving back it it made                                 it a fulfilling career for her which is                                 far more than the money or the prestige                                 or anything like that that may come with                                 it and so hoping that in the next                                 generation she was saying to me also                                 that you know in India things are                                 changing people are embracing more open                                 source there's more startups happening                                 and so we hope that that will be a trend                                 which continued and it really takes                                 projects like drupal to make that happen                                 projects which are financially                                 successful right because when when                                 capgemini has to hire under dribble                                 developers what do they do they sorry I                                 kept Gemini but they go around and they                                 poach people from the other shops that                                 exists already they find the best folks                                 they can and they pay them too much                                 money so they have to leave their other                                 job and that has a negative effect on                                 the small firms in the short term but                                 what it does it raises rates for                                 everybody and when you raise the rates                                 then you create more desire to have that                                 job more desire to learn drupal and so I                                 think that it's changing when when an                                 open source project becomes commercially                                 viable it becomes much more of a                                 commercially viable career solution so I                                 think that's sort of part of what she's                                 saying as well anyway let me go back                                 here and that's it I think I took too                                 much your time this is diet again that                                 was a picture of me but nice nice                                 keynote thank you and with that I just

  experience of me doing drupal in                                 Shanghai China so my background is I                                 have done two stops before my this                                 current trooper shop so my last startup                                 was doing via web sites in New York City                                 that's the time that I got into Drupal                                 and I was really interested in Drupal so                                 I started going to Drupal meetups in New                                 York and started presenting in New York                                 so in two thousand at the end up                                        would the startup becomes really                                 successful and I was started looking for                                 new challenge so guess where shanghai                                 china there's more money in new                                 opportunities so i decided it's time to                                 quit a job and go to the shanghai china                                 so i flew to shanghai in january two                                 thousand eleven just about a year ago                                 and i got my business license like small                                 engineering development shop business                                 license in march two thousand eleven so                                 three months after I landed in Shanghai                                 then in March that I came back to triple                                 crown Chicago for parties right that's                                 that's the most important thing given                                 for a year so I went back to Shanghai                                 China and I hire the two guys in May to                                 something                                                              make decision there were not many Drupal                                 developers in in China non money and the                                 most most suitable developers had a PHP                                 background of even Darnell background or                                 something related and what they did was                                 a lot of a lot of them were like                                 attacking Drupal chords and the facking                                 PHP templates I said that's the wild                                 picture of we were hosting a meet about                                 our                                 office so at that time I me to make                                 decision do I want to hire people who                                 hacked a lot of core hack codes or do i                                 want to hire someone who has no                                 experience in drupal and the trainer so                                 i decide i decided i want to hire people                                 without any jew experience and this is                                 one of my employee his name is alex is                                 Alex here nope so when I hired him he                                 didn't even know how to program he had                                 no idea about a PHP HTML so but that's                                 okay I I recognized his talent and I                                 thought he's really smart guy so I I                                 trained him I taught him PHP HTML CSS                                 JavaScript and even enjoyed in seven                                 month that he started contributing back                                 to your location module trooper commerce                                 module flexor is module Park whole                                 module and at the end of seven month he                                 received the district on scholarship so                                                                                                        the seven-month I didn't I didn't really                                 give him a lot of timing lessons on                                 Drupal itself I was actually teaching I                                 was actually teaching him how to learn                                 drupal on his own so there are two most                                 most important things I I think it's for                                 a new like outsider to become a Drupal                                 ER is first is the the community a                                 community communication so I brought him                                 to every Drupal Shanghai meet up and I                                 brought him to to go happy hour in some                                 time so for those you don't know why                                 people happy hour is a events have any                                 young every last Wednesday worldwide if                                 you don't have the happy hour event in                                 your city please organize them so it's a                                 it's a it's a drinking events and you                                 get to know each other and he talking                                 about a cause                                 anything and have fun and you start                                 sharing sharing experiences sharing                                 codes so I thought that was a very                                 useful and I also asked the addicts try                                 to present make a lightning run                                 presentation at every meet up so                                 obviously                                                              scholarship so now my shop has a maybe a                                                                                                       receiving a lot of a business in                                 Shanghai way thing at the moment there                                 are three trooper trooper shops in                                 Shanghai China and Shanghai has                                    million match politan population and I                                 think at each of those three trooper                                 shops there are at least of three to                                 five jobs opening so the economy is                                 booming and there's so many                                 opportunities and and it's it's great                                 opportunity so I think it's a for me                                 it's a it's a it's a really good chance                                 a good time so that's my experience with                                 China and rupa                                 sorry is it better now okay yeah I guess                                 so hi it's a better yeah okay it's                                 fernando garcia he's a technical

January we had                                                                                                        so it's not a huge as a drupalcon when                                 we leave

there are they seem like                                 coffee coffee cups but they can data                                 have permission to sell beer so you see                                 Barry in those coffee cups you know so                                 they that's why they excited about about                                 coffee and so we also contribute you now                                 with some Drupal Drupal contribute media                                 meetings and finally the conclusions is                                 that we are joining by two languages I                                 think that this is your biggest you know                                 opportunity and be in touch that we have                                 spanish and portuguese and they are                                 ninety percent similar I speak                                 Portuguese and spice because so easy and                                 what what we need to do is apart from                                 coaching people and and taking advantage                                 of our opportunities for networking and                                 doing translation we need to do more                                 modules because we have few modules we                                 need to do more core patches and more

in other                                 regions you know a shipper has wanted to                                 do something similar you know and that's                                 it thanks for listening                                 finally for open up for questions jakub                                 Sookie's a director professional                                 services Europe for aquia and a long                                 time Drupal contributor remember the                                 security team and it's from the Czech                                 Republic you talk to you a little bit                                 about maybe what's happened in Eastern                                 Europe over the past four years great                                 thanks so I was born and raised in Czech                                 Republic and then I decided to move to                                 london and i joined our korea but i                                  still have a lot of perception of what's                                  happening in czech republic and in                                  Eastern Europe although we don't like to                                  say it's Eastern Europe we like to say                                  it's central europe the community I                                  actually started just and as an                                  introduction i started the drupal check                                  community back five years ago on drupal                                  belts easy and that's actually one of                                  the challenges that I see that you saw                                  you had in your stats that some of the                                  countries are not grow growing that                                  merchant groups stupid a dork and I                                  think it does that's because some of the                                  communities in these countries have                                  local communities on Drupal Caesar or                                  their own and the challenge is always                                  the language so that's why some of the                                  countries I think you would find out                                  there they are actually drawing growing                                  more but not on groups or drupal org and                                  the communities and Drupal in these                                  countries are growing a lot but I think                                  the main challenge is for example in                                  Czech Republic czech republic is right                                  now a very standard european country so                                  it comes with all the challenges that                                  european countries have very expensive                                  pneus of people but at the same time it                                  didn't have a lot of time to grow in                                  terms of Drupal so I think that the main                                  countries that I see growing right now                                  our countries like Bulgaria Ukraine                                  Moldova where there are large Drupal                                  companies that you did are actually on                                  on Drupal cons like pro people that have                                  a lot of people in Bulgaria or moldova                                  or other Drupal companies that are                                  building teams in these countries and                                  that's where I see the Grove and I think                                  that if you have a Drupal company                                  the way to help us grow communities in                                  these countries is to come to these                                  countries and I'm not necessarily a fan                                  of offshoring work but at the same time                                  if he come to our countries and give the                                  people work you'll help grow the                                  community I'm not going to show you the                                  slide you know where it is evaluations                                  it's probably broken anyway but I'm                                  gonna open up discussion if you want to                                  hang out our discussion so there there's                                  a mic in the in the middle and then Mike

a lot of companies that want                                  to grow out of their countries because                                  they see it as a as a way to grow and

companies                                  should really care that there is there                                  is a lot of money but the the government                                  in those

      that big companies can provide and the                                  local the local businesses also have to                                  care that the big ones are coming and                                  they have to level up their quality and                                  the air mattress your processes and                                  seems like that so it's part of the                                  growing you know and there and that's                                  happening around actually in Latin                                  America for the market in China well                                  first of all there's a background                                  information china chinese government I                                  flying a huge amount of funding for                                  Chinese technology companies so why why                                  I mean China I'm trying to work with                                  local Chinese like I'm complains because                                  they have so much more money than I do                                  and why was about to go to China and I                                  there were a few trooper shots he may be                                  a while to do push-ups in United States                                  they contact me they said they are                                  interesting give me funding or like                                  become a partner of this program also                                  right now for my company the demand is                                  huge so I have to fly you as true                                  pillars to China to do the work there                                  and that we paying they are like us                                  equivalent salary so that's that's the                                  market foam for me another thing I want                                  to mention just in my experience being                                  in India is that pretty much every small                                  shop is working for other shops in the                                  u.s. at some level they're not they do                                  some direct clients and they do also                                  pretty much our subcontracting                                  frequently that's very common and then                                  the big Accenture isn't kept geminis and                                  all that a one thing that is surprising                                  about them we found is how much                                  strategic consulting they do so they'll                                  actually they're there India teams are                                  flying to the US and suggesting                                  solutions and working and sort of                                  selling directly which we didn't we                                  didn't realize so yeah Jacob you seen so                                  many markets do you see your training                                  infrastructure difference between the                                  companies like let's say in India China                                  and in the u.s. because in the past few                                  days you know the more interaction I've                                  had there's been a lot of talk about                                  lack of talent but like you know the                                  gentleman here said Indian and Chinese                                  companies find it very comfortable to                                  get a non Drupal guys spend six months                                  seven months train him and then you know                                  make him efficient is there is there a                                  basic difference between the way these                                  companies operate back home in India                                  China versus in the US I mean I don't                                  know it really how that works but I've I                                  tend to contradict that I mean my my                                  experience in India is that while there                                  is the ability to pick some up and train                                  them and often times i think the the                                  margins there are good between what you                                  can charge your clients once you pay                                  your developers so it allows you to do                                  that safely for more time or the US                                  company can't do that there's a huge                                  fear of getting training someone and                                  having them getting taken by one of the                                  big companies isn't it son right no                                  there isn't but with all of these victim                                  is coming and I think there would be                                  yeah as of now yeah I think that's that                                  that is a piece I think it's easier to                                  invest in fuel for a longer time because                                  the financials make sense in India in                                  China right now but will that continue                                  to be the case as the rates go up and as                                  the you know the salaries go up i'm not                                  sure i'm curious to see there's a lot of                                  when I was in India because I training                                  is what I primarily do like I'm an                                  engineer by training but but now i'm a                                  teacher primarily and so asking a lot                                  about that there's a lot of demand in                                  india for certification there's a lot of                                  demand for sort of formal education and                                  a piece of paper at the end of it that                                  says you've you're now a drupal expert                                  weird something it's very contentious in                                  the US that no one wants to sort of do                                  that so i don't know if that would help                                  grow the number of experts by providing                                  a financial incentive and equitation                                  maybe yeah it helps to the shoddy cons                                  if it helps with the reputation the                                  aspirational economy side of it um just                                  personally a little bit worried about a                                  certification whatever that means                                  because i don't know i don't know how it                                  works there but I see it as a way for                                  the companies to say we have Drupal                                  certified people so we can sell you                                  services but it doesn't necessarily                                  reflect the quality and it's very hard                                  to create a certification program there                                  if Rick's quality right you know that                                  and I just wanted to quickly say about                                  the last with the previous question that                                  I believed in the future the work will                                  flow both ways and we can already see                                  that and just it's not in emerging                                  markets but for example I know one of                                  the big companies in Europe is                                  desperately looking for a leaf developer                                  and looking to hire him in or her in an                                  America and fly him to Europe so this                                  divorce will fly both ways very soon so                                  by the way if you're interested talk to                                  me                                  okay about certification and I I think                                  that is it is wilborn nature you know do                                  police coming to the universities they                                  are starting to give some trainings at                                  least and happens in Latin America so we                                  if we want to say i am a company that                                  provides quality and i have people that                                  has skills and that had a a good profile                                  and perhaps we also need need to clear                                  out there about already curriculum the                                  curriculum that we have right now is                                  drupal org profiles you know how do you                                  contribute how much you contribute how                                  good is your coat how awesome are your                                  modules and this is a great way to make                                  you know a good a good profit for it for                                  every developer and companies should                                  support that you know that that happen                                  in the US Europe and that should happen                                  also I hope in the other regions that                                  are emerging and growing they should                                  learn that they should not forget that                                  we are open source you know I leave                                  those principles with that probably have                                  to close we're running at a time but                                  thank you all for coming and being                                  involved so take care
