Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: USER EXPERIENCE FOR OPEN SOURCE: HOW TO GALVANIZE A COMMUNITY
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	This February we led a Drupal 7 usability study at Google and livestreamed it to over 115 developers. Usability studies provide a firsthand look at how users experience a product and are incredibly effective at highlighting interface flaws and confusions. However, the impact these studies have are limited by their audience; it is only those present during the study who really feel engaged with it. After the analysis and recorded videos have been released, the thrill of the discussion and collaborative brainstorming has already died down. When you open up usability studies to the world, you have the power to stir an army of people into action. Everyone watches the same users getting frustrated, everyone feels the same pain at interface quirks, and everyone participates in the discussion, and ultimately the solution. We believe that live usability studies are the best way to advocate for a focus on user experience in Drupal development. In this talk, we will explain how we ran this study, key insights we gained from it, and how to do it again.

feasibility team and that's how you can                                find me on Drupal that work and Twitter                                awesome okay cool so um in greece's                                keynote yesterday he he said that Drupal                                is six point seven percent of all                                continent or it runs six point seven                                percent of all content management system                                websites on the internet and he painted                                a vision to say how could we grow and                                make Drupal larger and take oh you know                                have larger market share within the CMS                                ecosystem and one of the things that he                                said the way that we could do that is by                                making Drupal easier and better and that                                is why we did this yeah so we want to                                talk a little bit about why originally                                we want to do this study and then also                                how this study can be pretty easily                                replicated so when I was working at                                Google with garren one thing we realized                                was that you know there's a large amount                                of people here at this campus in                                Mountain View thousands actually that                                fit this profile of being technicals                                technically savvy not engineers but you                                know tech savvy these are people that                                should be able to download Drupal                                install it and just make a basic website                                with it each of us have you know learn                                drupal by ourselves and then also taught                                Drupal or train other people and Drupal                                so we've all been aware of the different                                struggles people face when trying to                                learn drupal from the start so and since                                you know we all these UX sensibilities                                we figure this is be a great time for a                                usability study so let's I guess take a                                look at a video                                this is a clip from one of the                                participants in the study I don't think                                that's it                                what do you think that list is so add a                                new field I can select a field type                                he's trying to figure out what it is                                feel like it's in the right direction                                but I don't know the words in context of                                websites let's see                                still no idea                                so we did eight of these this was user                                three I think right and they're all                                available online for you guys to watch                                we'll get into that a little bit later                                so let's start talking about how to                                actually do this so like I said we had a                                really set audio profile in mind of who                                we actually wanted to be doing this                                study with we wanted people that were                                tech-savvy not engineers and that had                                never used Drupal before so the first                                thing that we did was create a survey                                just to sort of send out to people                                within Google these were all Google                                employees I did this study so basically                                through word of mouth and just kind of                                talk in a bunch of people we sent out                                this survey trying to get sort of key                                characteristics about people and then                                based on that we chose them for the                                study or not now what's really unique                                about this study is not only that we had                                two scripts so we had for users doing                                one script we also really wanted to                                simulate people building real websites                                so when we asked people to fill out that                                survey one of the questions was what                                kind of website do you want to build                                what kind of functionality would it have                                so instead of just putting someone up to                                the task of like build some random                                website that you don't care about nor                                have any investment in we were having                                people that were saying you know you                                 know my parents have the store and my                                 dad wants me to make this you know                                 website that showcases their products                                 I'd like to do that one day so using                                 those sort of real situations we kind of                                 sculpted the script around that so are                                 two different scripts the first one was                                 really about content management building                                 and organizing content using content                                 types also we introduced fields and we                                 tried to reach the point where people                                 were installing and configuring modules                                 and enabling them our second script also                                 did some of the content management                                 basics but we were able to we all we                                 actually decided to bring some                                 contributed modules into the study so we                                 weren't just doing Drupal core stuff we                                 were using contribute contributed                                 modules like views we actually do that                                 in the first the first day too but so we                                 put users into the views interface sort                                 of like accelerated where they might be                                 and got some feedback on that we also                                 were doing stuff with image styles so                                 the setup for the first day was pretty                                 similar to what we can on previous                                 usability studies in the beginning we're                                 just trying to get people to use Drupal                                 core as it is out of the box and play                                 with some of the stuff that was already                                 there they use the toolbar module they                                 visited the dashboard page at the end of                                 thing we didn't have them use vuze we                                 wanted to test the simple use UI and see                                 if that worked was pretty successful but                                 in the second study we took out the                                 toolbar module and put an admin menu                                 instead and we took out the dashboard                                 module may put in total control instead                                 we wanted to have some compare and                                 contrast options for those different                                 features the same features but different                                 done different ways and we also put in                                 WYSIWYG just to see if people's reaction                                 to that would be any different so                                 there's a different setup for both tests                                 so a good question is how did it                                 actually work and it really is not that                                 hard and I promise you almost everybody                                 in this room could do this yourself the                                 only two pieces of fancy hardware that                                 we had over a big mac tower that was                                 capable of handing handling all of the                                 streaming and recording that we were                                 doing well allowing the user to browse                                 the web and we had a really cool                                 microphone that one of my co-workers had                                 that actually picked up the audio really                                 well we used three pieces of software                                 Camtasia is a really great easy way to                                 capture your screen and the audio of                                 what's going on in HD it's got a free                                                                                                       that we use livestream com to live                                 streaming in HD that was completely free                                 so props to them for letting us stream                                 HD for free and we also use google                                 hangouts on air kind of as a and so all                                 three of these kind of served as a big                                 backup magnificent mechanism to make                                 sure that we got everything and it was                                 all being recorded simultaneously so                                 what was it actually like in the room                                 this is a view from my face what there                                 were is there were two so there were                                 four of us in the room there was Becky                                 sitting next to the participant actually                                 asking the questions and guiding him                                 through the tasks or got or attempting                                 to see how well they guided themselves                                 through the task and Jen and I were                                 sitting next to each other looking at a                                 mirror of what Becky in the participant                                 were we're seeing on                                 another monitor and we were up there                                 making sure that the stripe streaming                                 and the actual site was functioning well                                 meanwhile online this was happening in                                 the droop how many of you guys were in                                 the Drupal usability IRC during that                                 time awesome so you guys like actually                                 saw how cool it was that people were                                 shouting you know about how painful                                 watching these users struggle was so it                                 was it was really neat to see that you                                 know we I think we had up I think the                                 highest viewer account at a single time                                 I saw was                                                              at one time so they're probably a lot of                                 people that saw this yeah yeah that was                                 only live stream we don't know how many                                 people were on hangouts on air because                                 that it was still in beta at the time so                                 this is what was happening online it was                                 very quiet in the room but it was very                                 loud there was a lot of discussion                                 online and that was that was one of the                                 really cool aspects about it so once we                                 finished we stuck the videos up on                                 YouTube we made a playlist and we got to                                 work actually analyzing and digesting                                 these things one of the really neat                                 things about putting them on YouTube is                                 that I don't know if you know this but                                 you can right-click are you on the                                 YouTube you know I guess the status bar                                 along the bottom of the video and you                                 can copy the URL at a specific time so                                 you can link to a specific time in a                                 specific YouTube video and so what we                                 did is we pulled out links of specific                                 moments where users were struggling or                                 had really great quotes that that                                 allowed us to show what they were                                 thinking of at that time and we organize                                 them into a whole bunch of themes and                                 you know we organize them by themes and                                 modules and that's what you can see up                                 here so the next thing we did is we took                                 this organized list and put it in this                                 really big table on drupal.org and we                                 wanted to do this so they were sort of                                 one central repository of all the                                 different issues that we came across in                                 the study and so right now this is up                                 will if you will put this link up                                 somewhere but um yes it's linked to from                                 the usability group and basically we                                 have sort of what the issue was and then                                 like Darren said those direct links to                                 it and what's really awesome is that                                 right now people in the community are                                 going ahead and making issues and                                 putting them into the right issue queues                                 for these                                 take problems so we were like think this                                 is really awesome that people are doing                                 it and we definitely need to keep up                                 that you know momentum and keep going so                                 be sure to check this out and if you're                                 someone who is sort of like an expert in                                 a module area or you just really care                                 about it see if there's any way you can                                 start carrying on the conversation in                                 the right places the other thing we did                                 which actually just went up last night                                 which we're really excited about is that                                 we created a sort of higher-level                                 usability report and we're going to talk                                 about some of the conclusions later in                                 the presentation this is also available                                 on drupal.org okay so a lot of things                                 went really well because it was                                 successful um one of the one of the                                 great things that went well was helpline                                 Jen Jen was in the room so when users                                 were struggled after a few minutes they                                 didn't have to struggle for the rest of                                 the hour they could just ask jen and she                                 would help get them through and on to                                 the next task the other things that were                                 really helpful is to have a high-speed                                 internet connection the double monitor                                 setup was really great so that Jen and I                                 could monitor what was happening at the                                 same time as Becky in the participant                                 was seeing it it's important to make                                 sure it all works beforehand so test it                                 and the redundancy because we had some                                 problems where we like forgot to turn on                                 the audio capture on one thing and you                                 know the video capture on another thing                                 but the redundancy is redundancy is                                 important and I mean yeah and so that                                 being said there definitely some things                                 that could have been done a lot better                                 the videos were released pretty quickly                                 but at the same time there's really no                                 reason why they shouldn't have been                                 released the exact same day they                                 happened all we did was save the file                                 make sure it was you know the thing                                 played from start to finish then we                                 uploaded it to YouTube the YouTube                                 conversion takes like I don't know                                    minutes or something but then it's                                 online a really central part of making                                 one of these things successful I think                                 we've all realized is keeping up the                                 momentum and so you know you have                                     people watching something but then you                                 don't try to engage with them until                                 another week later it's kind of hard to                                 keep him to like make everyone just as                                 passionate as they were about it in the                                 IRC channel so getting the videos up                                 faster in general just like doing speed                                 is great anything you can do faster do a                                 faster more press and hype just the idea                                 you know I mean we ended up getting a                                 lot of people watching but I think if we                                 had planned a little bit more beforehand                                 we could have gotten this even sort of a                                 bigger deal before it started happening                                 um we like that survey the screenshot of                                 that survey that I showed you guys                                 previously we didn't do one of those for                                 participants after the session that I                                 mean I don't I just don't think we                                 really thought it out I think it would                                 have been a great thing to have to ask                                 people questions sort of like so what do                                 you think of Drupal or just have a list                                 of adjectives which of these adjectives                                 you know best describes your experience                                 with durable just to get some of that                                 feedback additionally i know i guess he                                 says on wednesday our last session and                                 we were like all right everyone going to                                 drupal usability IRC channel and we'll                                 talk about it on Monday which is cool                                 but we could have also really scheduled                                 some sometimes for everyone to like meet                                 and talk about things we could have also                                 used we could have done google hangouts                                 on air again and been like everyone                                 let's come in and talk about it live                                 let's keep the aliveness the of the                                 situation going we do want to stress                                 though you don't have to be a big                                 awesome company like Google to do this                                 though like this is a type of thing that                                 can be repeated many times and it should                                 be repeated many times because it really                                 helps us as a community to come together                                 and see well like there's definitely                                 something that needs to be improved um                                 the things that Google really helped us                                 with is the fact that we had a large                                 surplus of people who fit our                                 demographic Google was totally down to                                 do this and willing to let their                                 employees spend time during their day to                                 do this and also Google provided the                                 t-shirts that we gave to participants as                                 compensation so honestly if you work at                                 a if you work at a somewhat you know                                 medium-sized company that works with                                 Drupal or it encourages your work with                                 Drupal you don't remember you don't need                                 to be testing with brand new users you                                 can pick any demographic you'd like for                                 a study all you need to do is get about                                 eight people use your setup like Darren                                 said the technology we used was at least                                 from the streaming perspective all free                                 or what we did it for free yeah and                                 the thing is you don't even need to                                 stream it I mean if you want to take                                 like three or four three or four hours                                 out of your day and say you know what                                 this module is really hard to do so grab                                 like two or three people from your                                 office who aren't familiar with it and                                 just put on Camtasia watch them to                                 struggle through it throw it up on                                 YouTube but like that in and of itself                                 is so helpful and that only took you                                 three hours and like then that'll start                                 a discussion I mean like you can go big                                 and do the whole streaming thing but                                 like you can do it small you don't have                                 to do all the bells and whistles as well                                 let's talk about why doing it live is                                 awesome typically when you do a                                 usability study it's like the person                                 moderating the study the participant and                                 then maybe five people behind a glass                                 wall or something watching that really                                 limits the circulation of the                                 information right even if it's just                                 those people and they all write blog                                 posts and they all go on Twitter and                                 talk about it it really only emotionally                                 touched and was experienced by those                                 five people and I guess the moderator                                 when you do this stuff live and you                                 stream it you bring it to an unlimited                                 number of people like in our case you                                 know over                                                              going through these struggles and pains                                 of new users together and for open                                 source we think this is really awesome                                 also a great thing that study did was                                 you know with the IRC Channel going                                 real-time discussion happening real-time                                 planning and problem solving and people                                 be like oh my god that'll be so easy to                                 fix let me just go make an issue about                                 it it brought us I think it really                                 brought us together as a community and                                 it's also bringing UX things more to the                                 forefront of what's up and ripple right                                 now so let's go into a little bit of the                                 different conclusions we found that we                                 talked about in that higher level                                 summary so basically all those different                                 issues that are in that exhaustive list                                 on drupal.org we've organized them into                                 four different layers you can kind of                                 put the issues into these different                                 buckets and those are interface                                 terminology flow and conceptual so let's                                 talk a little bit about each of those                                 so the first problem we ran into was in                                 your face and a lot of these problems                                 are not necessarily easy to fix but                                 they're easy to identify when someone's                                 on a certain page they don't know what                                 button to click or they click the button                                 and it doesn't do what they think it's                                 supposed to do labeled wrong it's in the                                 wrong place it doesn't have the right                                 action people can't interact with the                                 interface inappropriate way it                                 experiences a lot and it resulted in a                                 lot of direct issues that were created                                 in some that have already been resolved                                 the second problem was terminology this                                 is another one that seems like it should                                 be pretty straightforward to fix people                                 looked at lists and didn't know what the                                 words meant people looked at navigation                                 and didn't know where to go and it's                                 just a matter of trying to get the words                                 that we use to match the words that                                 normal people use again simple problem                                 defect is hard to decide what to                                 actually change it to so flow what we're                                 talking about here is the situation                                 where a user's trying to complete a task                                 and there's somewhere along the process                                 let's say they're trying to configure an                                 image style there at one screen and                                 they're like okay what's next where do I                                 go next they're looking around for some                                 sort of clue about how to how to                                 continue or you know there's just                                 there's no logical sequence for them at                                 least in their mind there's no sequence                                 about how to continue doing things the                                 whole flow like their mental model of                                 how I can change how images appear in my                                 drupal website does not match how Drupal                                 wants you to change images on your                                 website this is also stuff we're                                 actually image tiles is a great example                                 because every I think was it every user                                 every user believe that from the display                                 like when you're going to manage fields                                 and you're looking at the display fields                                 interface every single user thought well                                 why can't I change how the image looks                                 from here everything wasn't in every one                                 every single one they hit this idea of                                 going up to image styles and in                                 configuration that was not there um yeah                                 that was bad one so conceptual layer                                 this is really the the big underlying                                 one here in that users that are new to                                 the Drupal system just don't understand                                 how it works the only time our users                                 solidly understood what they were doing                                 is when Drupal work like a conventional                                 blogging platform like blogspot or                                 WordPress like when they were able to                                 hit                                 add piece of content type it out add in                                 some keywords hit save and it appeared                                 on the front page of the website that                                 made a lot of sense to them but the all                                 the awesome things that people can do                                 like allow you to really take advise                                 your content and create specific lists                                 and displays of it that whole aspect was                                 just not there because Drupal you know                                 didn't provide any sort of contextual                                 clues for them to pick up on that it was                                 only the surface level that they were                                 able to scratch they weren't able to go                                 to more deeper than that ok so we're                                 going to talk about some of the stuff                                 that went really well one thing that                                 really surprised me I'm a huge fan of                                 the admin module I hate the toolbar                                 module so every time I go to Drupal                                     turn off to a bar and turn on admin menu                                 so I was like we got it tested it's                                 going to do so much better it didn't do                                 so much better I was really surprising                                 to watch people navigate from the top                                 all the way to the bottom every single                                 time that end up clicking on list which                                 was the last link and they missed pages                                 like content which are really important                                 because that was a top-level link and if                                 there's a drop down i'm just going to                                 drop down and keep going in so that was                                 really surprising so toolbar did really                                 well the administration overlay this is                                 something that we improved from Drupal                                 sex people understood this is                                 administration this is me looking at the                                 website and there was a great                                 distinction between that closing overlay                                 and seeing the content refresh right                                 away which really gratifying people                                 they're like oh look it just happened                                 that's exactly what I wanted there was                                 no refreshing the page that was just                                 really happy and then we also showed                                 people the views simple UI the very                                 beginning weren't like now go make a                                 list we didn't have to explain why it                                 was called views just terminology but as                                 soon as I got in there and they're like                                 oh I want a list of these fuss in this                                 order save and it worked it was like you                                 know views in Drupal                                                   experience the new simple UI in triple                                   was very successful there's a lot of                                 really great things we learned to                                 so drupal has a steep learning curve for                                 new people but we really feel doesn't                                 have to be this way as a community let's                                 strive to make Drupal more helpful and                                 supportive of new users you know this                                 screen it's really not that helpful or                                 supportive of people when they first                                 install Drupal so after doing this whole                                 study we actually thought up a proposal                                 of a way to actually take advantage of                                 this particular portion of the                                 installation path and give new users aid                                 a chance to catch up to speed yeah so so                                 what we think would be really helpful is                                 because so many problems arose from this                                 lack of conceptual foundation like                                 people don't understand what content                                 content types fields are and they're                                 forced to interact with them when                                 they're building a site we propose                                 giving them a short little quick easy                                 tutorial when they first installed jable                                 something that all of you guys who                                 already know this you can click the X in                                 the corner and get rid of but this would                                 but this you know spending                                              on this might really really help and                                 save a user hours so yeah and another                                 thing that we think would be really cool                                 is to make sure that they know that                                 they're not alone when they're going                                 through this because it because we all                                 know that there are so many resources                                 out there that a lot of us have written                                 and contributed and we want to make sure                                 that new users know about that so what                                 we have here is we have a very rough                                 like wireframe prototype style mock of                                 what this could be it's a ten side thing                                 that when the user first gets to their                                 Drupal installation this is something                                 that could see them we don't know if                                 this is the right format I mean and I'm                                 sure that it'll you know something would                                 have to go through many many iterations                                 but this is a this is a something to                                 start talking about so what we would                                 first do is we would introduce the                                 Drupal actually cares about your content                                 content is very important because we                                 have to separate the idea of content                                 from a webpage so contents are called                                 nodes that's an important piece of                                 terminology that new users don't get                                 right now contents are organized content                                 is organized into content types                                 and we explained yeah actually in the                                 first line we introduced the metaphor of                                 building a newspaper because that helps                                 us tell a story in a very relatable way                                 that everybody everybody no matter                                 whether you're advanced or whether                                 you're a you know very basic user you                                 have you know what a newspaper website                                 looks like it would have different                                 content types like events and articles                                 we say within those content types                                 there's fields and fields help us build                                 a relationship between things this is                                 why fields are useful you know these are                                 these are very key fundamental                                 vocabulary items that were introducing                                 to users yeah yes so for people that are                                 very visually oriented themes are                                 something that they're that they're                                 drawn to we had one user that                                 immediately went to the appearance page                                 before even trying to create content and                                 this user actually I think one of her                                 comments were Bartok                                                   that I don't get it so in this method                                 what we're trying to do is show them the                                 actual screen and then sort of                                 contextually give some some instruction                                 about what things are so there's the                                 appearance page and after doing the idea                                 of themes it's a great segue to modules                                 because modules are also things that are                                 installed onto your website right one of                                 the I think most unfortunate things that                                 of the study was that you know there's                                 we all know how many amazing awesome                                 modules are out there and how much is                                 possible using modules most of these new                                 users to just did not even think of the                                 idea of adding a module even after they                                 were told of the idea of a module it was                                 like they didn't think oh maybe there's                                 a module that can do that let me go                                 check that thought process wasn't there                                 so giving them that from the very                                 beginning like hey if you want to do                                 something and you're not really sure                                 search for it there's probably a way to                                 kind of plug it into your site using a                                 module we thought that would be a super                                 helpful thing for new people and then                                 again like with the appearance page                                 giving a screenshot of what the modules                                 page looks like with some very simple                                 contextual things about like enable                                 versus disabled where you can find                                 configuration options also going off on                                 the idea of how modules are so important                                 to people that are that are using Drupal                                 to sort of tell them the users hey these                                 are some of the most popular commonly                                 use modules that people don't really                                 do without and this is where you can                                 link to them and it's okay because                                 you're you're probably going to use them                                 to like you know the fact that right now                                 there's no easy week editor um rather                                 than being having well can you do that                                 can you add WYSIWYG right from the start                                 look there's lots of things that are not                                 there right now but you can add them all                                 and there what modules and here are some                                 really awesome ones and lastly we wanted                                 to end on a positive encouraging note                                 sort of both introducing people to the                                 Drupal community to like Darren was                                 saying this idea that there's a whole                                 network of people that are learning and                                 providing resources and willing to help                                 we also think a tutorial or sort of walk                                 through like this would make people jump                                 into the community at a slightly more                                 elevated level maybe instead of asking                                 like you know what's a node these sort                                 of this types of turnout terminology                                 questions they already have a vocabulary                                 to use to articulate their problems to                                 articulate what exactly they're trying                                 to achieve and so also like Darren said                                 you know going forward it's not like                                 this is the best way to do it you know                                 like this is a walkthrough method                                 there's also video contextual tooltips                                 sort of as you go through an interface                                 something gets revealed you can hover                                 over stuff step-by-step tutorial there's                                 many ways to accomplish this and Guerra                                 and I actually spoke to Robert Helpmann                                 jr. he's the author of this book                                 designing the obvious he's a pretty                                 well-known usability guy and we showed                                 him these mocks we told he actually had                                 never used your pool before so it was a                                 really interesting conversation to have                                 with him because he went through our                                 mocks and we were able to see what he                                 was getting and not getting but he said                                 you know this is definitely a solid                                 approach to begin with and then with                                 continual iteration and trying to find                                 out what works and what doesn't work it                                 can only get better so this is a quote                                 from his really famous book that sold                                 lots of copies for users to feel good                                 about an application they need to                                 understand they need to feel as if they                                 understand it and drupal as a web app                                 right now that doesn't really happen if                                 you saw any portion of those usability                                 studies users were not like they would                                 they did not walk away feeling                                 comfortable and supported or as if they                                 understood the system they probably                                 walked away wanting to use WordPress or                                 something like that so to bring it back                                 to what drew said is like you in order                                 for Drupal to grow and be a really                                 successful content management system it                                 has to win the hearts and minds of                                 people in Drupal                                                        you create a hostile environment for                                 them to learn how it works in and so                                 what we're really looking forward to is                                 the community coming together and saying                                 how could we actually allow less                                 technical users who are not developers                                 who aren't people who are fluent in PHP                                 to come in and help this content                                 management system grow because that's                                 great for our ecosystem anything else                                 one had ok cool that's that's the end of                                 our formal presentation and we would                                 love to talk to you guys about what you                                 saw and what what what feedback you have                                 about about the mocks or about the                                 studies or any questions you have so                                 please come up to the microphone                                 hi um I have first a comment um thank                                 you this was absolutely amazing process                                 to go through so I I've been part of two                                 formal usability studies that we've done                                 for drupal before one of these in                                 university of minnesota in                                              one in the university of minnesota in                                                                                                          saying it's like the eight of us in the                                 room had our minds blown and our lives                                 completely changed as a result of this                                 and then we come and we try and explain                                 it to people who've not been through it                                 and they're like yeah but those people                                 were just stupid i mean drupal's not                                 really that hurt you know it's just like                                 it's really hard to explain so this was                                 fundamentally amazing because it really                                 opened doors for everybody to get                                 involved and see the impact of this and                                 those videos I know we only had like                                                                                                         videos are being referenced in issues                                 like look at this time stand to this                                 time stamp it illustrates what we're                                 seeing me it's really fundamentally                                 changing the way that we are addressing                                 usability stuff so I just want to say                                 thank you to google thank you to you too                                 and Jen as well like everything it was                                 great and the question I had is um can                                 you show the URL where all this stuff is                                 online because um you know we have lot                                 of code sprints and stuff like that                                 happening and I'd love to like point                                 people at the stuff yeah so we're gonna                                 put up the slide and we're also going to                                 put up that entire mock-up thing we can                                 also put up the fireworks images if                                 anyone wants to just actually play                                 around play with stuff we'll put those                                 all up I guess we can tweet it and stuff                                 yeah we're gonna will open source the                                 box right yeah but but just in general                                 the larger conclusion there that's                                 there's a seven page PDF the kind of                                 outlines that can these conceptual                                 findings / these four layers that's our                                 yeah it's got quotes and that's that's                                 already online and there's quotes                                 actually in the detailed report with                                 links to the individual you know with                                 the YouTube URL so more stuff will come                                 yeah I'm groupset drupal org on /                                 usability right yeah that's                                 hey thanks my name is Ryan a question I                                 have let me say that I will relate                                 Microsoft Word to Drupal for just a                                 minute and in terms of Microsoft Word                                 having hundreds of features and average                                 user uses five of them drupal using have                                 enters of features average user like you                                 said editor content creator whatever                                 using five of them is there a good way                                 to dump down the user interface so you                                 take away all of the advanced features i                                 know i mean i know obviously permissions                                 you can you know keep people from doing                                 certain things but I was just creating a                                 Drupal                                                              thing on the right side that said                                 reorder row entries or something like                                 that and that was you know something                                 that we had to hide with jquery or form                                 api or something like that but is there                                 a common module for dumbing these things                                 down and removing advanced features                                 that's a great question i think you're                                 definitely right a lot of stuff can be                                 removed the problem with installing a                                 module is that you'd have to install a                                 module to remove this you know so that's                                 why we're kind of a proponent of like                                 stuff to make life easier should go in                                 core and then you should be able to                                 unabie able to add more stuff to make                                 your life more complex sure there's also                                 a lot of problems with removing stuff                                 from interfaces because then when people                                 get to the point where that actually                                 want those features they don't know                                 they're there so that's also something                                 that can make trip will appear really                                 limited if you do it too much so there's                                 there's a really fragile line there it                                 also really makes advanced users upset                                 and our community is full of really loud                                 advanced users and we don't hear at all                                 what the beginners say so there's                                 definitely kind of treading both sides                                 of that line is really important sure                                 yeah and I also think like maybe not i                                 think the idea of hiding things when r                                 elephant is definitely key there were                                 for example when you're adding a field                                 you know at this point like the                                 multi-step form process you need to go                                 through just to add if you like what's a                                 default value like how can they you know                                 what's the widget look like all these                                 things people are like it's just too                                 much exposure at that point in time i                                 just want to add the field and be able                                 to upload the image but at the same time                                 dumbing things down is not necessarily                                 how we want to                                 new users you know it's like right now                                 maybe they feel kind of dumb or they                                 feel alienated by the system but if we                                 can empower them to feel like here's a                                 really base set of stuff you can use and                                 then you know there's so much more I                                 think that's definitely cool and also                                 with dependencies on modules it gets you                                 know it gets tricky with what can we                                 should I cannot deal with but yes good                                 point thanks all right thanks so I                                 definitely want to thank you also for                                 the study and especially the live                                 streaming aspect of it was was amazing                                 so I participated in one of the previous                                 usability studies in Minnesota Jen and                                 Angie we're at and I think so the reason                                 we couldn't do something like live                                 streaming or even posting videos quickly                                 there was because the usability lab it                                 was done it had a very strict policy                                 about confidentiality so for example if                                 somebody had said something during the                                 during the study that might reveal who                                 they are we had to go back and scrub the                                 videos and make sure that was cut out                                 before we could release it I was running                                 a few you at Google had to deal with an                                 issue like that yeah actually I do you                                 go I'm really glad you brought that up                                 because it's something we forgot to put                                 in here so each one of our participants                                 signed a standard waiver basically                                 saying from their part like hey it's                                 fine if you put me online it's fine i'm                                 going to be online i don't care whatever                                 so there was that part and then on the                                 Google part originally I was thinking                                 about saying oh let's try and use google                                 usability labs you know our own google                                 usability labs but it ended up that we                                 were going to be running into all those                                 types of issues and it was like could we                                 have done I tracking could we have done                                 you know cool stuff like that yes but                                 all the red tape that would've been                                 associated with that I think is what is                                 really what ended up like let's just do                                 it this simple stripped-down way you are                                 also your point about having to edit                                 things out we we were also cognizant of                                 that I guess we just really try to                                 ensure that well at least from what                                 people were showing on their screens                                 there would be no issues there and we                                 prepped every user just by saying you                                 know don't talk about Google secrets                                 pretty much it's and I guess we trusted                                 them from there on out okay thank you                                 yeah they were all told that it was                                 being live streamed and like it was an                                 anonymous thing and so like you just                                 trust him to be cognizant of that thanks                                 hi I'm frost I'm from the nerdery and we                                 also have a very large UX and ie                                 department as well got like                                           that work on stuff quite a bit and I'm                                 also kind of a bit of a usability not                                 myself one thing we've found not just in                                 Drupal but a lots of different pieces of                                 software is that on interfaces where                                 users especially like content                                 contributors not necessarily people who                                 are doing CMS configuration but it could                                 work either way is whenever there's some                                 kind of a form they appreciate a couple                                 things one is iconography and just some                                 sort of small image which depicts in                                 some sort of way what they're about to                                 do and also the idea that when you're                                 building content putting things together                                 that the form that they're entering kind                                 of matches the display that they're                                 going to actually see ya and that's                                 always a problem in Drupal because I                                 mean by default you're getting a bunch                                 of fields just listed from top to bottom                                 you know and hopefully you're playing                                 form of course in the theme layer you                                 can rearrange things but by default                                 that's not the way we do it so are there                                 any suggestions and how we can get                                 involved and fixing these sorts of                                 things yeah I'll let Jen take that I                                 just want to say user for if anyone                                 wants to go back to the videos had the                                 exact confusion between how data is                                 entered into a field versus how its                                 displayed exactly you're talking about                                 this is a really really long standing                                 problem interpol preview has never                                 really worked exactly how we want it to                                 and when we introduced the overlay and                                 the admin theme and all the stuff in                                 Drupal                                                                   tasks from front-end tasks the content                                 creation screen became a problem because                                 is that an administrative task in Drupal                                 not really like that's outside of the                                 admin path that's something that you can                                 grant you know any random person can                                 create content but a lot of times it's                                 still shown in this administrative                                 overlay it's an administrative theme you                                 hit preview it's still in the                                 administrative theme we're not even                                 talking about layout we're talking about                                 different fonts this is stuff that                                 throws everybody off so we can solve a                                 lot of these problems more working on it                                 there's definitely a really old issue                                 about this that we're trying to figure                                 out the bigger problem is layout right                                 this is something that Drupal hasn't                                 even solved for administrators yet let                                 alone content creators but there's also                                 a lot of really good work going on right                                 now and trying to figure out                                 to get like edit contacts in so maybe                                 you can see what the page would look                                 like and in place editing is being                                 talked about all of the competition's                                 doing it it's a really hard problem for                                 us to solve because we separate content                                 from presentation so much which is why                                 we have this form approach we know it's                                 been the fact that we actually can like                                 seeing the the user content entry forms                                  but it's got to be like a separate                                  template from the display template which                                  means there's room for disparity there                                  so interesting you found our theme layer                                  if we could somehow combine both of                                  those functionalities into a single                                  template so that the display and the                                  entry are kind of similar it's possibly                                  the basis it's just hard yeah Emily are                                  we are working on it we know people want                                  it it's just ya tekkin technically it's                                  a challenge I think there's also a                                  danger though because because what to                                  boss them about Drupal is that it                                  removes its content from its                                  presentation which allows you to present                                  the content in so many different ways in                                  somebody different contexts and that's                                  why it's cool it's really tough to keep                                  communicating that when you have when                                  you're editing content in the same way                                  that it's presented and so if you're                                  editing a title of a page or something                                  like that like it like are you actually                                  editing the title of that page are you                                  editing the menu link are you adding the                                  title tag of that I mean like these are                                  all big questions that arise and if                                  we're starting to look more towards                                  inline editing I think it's really                                  important that we keep on doing tests                                  even if it's like grab your brother put                                  him in front of a computer for an hour                                  and see like what he can't do like those                                  things are so valuable because most                                  users run into the same things over and                                  over and over so even if you can't find                                  the perfect person testing with somebody                                  is better is infinitely better than                                  testing with nobody and especially now                                  that Drupal                                                         complicated with its display modes like                                  before there was just full and teaser                                  and that was it now you can add whatever                                  you want and that doesn't even talk                                  about what you've configured in views or                                  what you've configured in panels and                                  everything else you're pulling in                                  individually and it's really hard for a                                  content creator like here write an                                  article and they're like okay and then                                  they hit preview and I only see full                                  view right and so you're like okay well                                  I didn't realize that when it showed up                                  in the list of articles on the sidebar                                  it was going to truncate at this funny                                  play                                  and maybe that's not actually the teaser                                  splitter maybe that's some like views                                  truncate for matter and how do you                                  preview that so there is definitely like                                  drupal has rich flexible content and                                  when you remove that from your content                                  creators you can actually end up                                  creating more confusion so if we want                                  you will be more like a static page                                  creator that in content editing works                                  when you want Drupal to be more like                                  drupal it gets much harder to try and                                  convey these issues so if you could have                                  like preview full moon preview side by                                  our preview like maybe views only use                                  display modes now you've got to                                  configure those but maybe in the bees                                  you i mean this gets really complicated                                  but yeah you know you want to help                                  there's a lot to be done but hey I'm                                  Michael I also want to say thanks for                                  doing that because it's given us such a                                  good resource to refer to to get some                                  you know real people's stories real                                  people's reactions their lives are sort                                  of you know weaving through Drupal there                                  and we get to watch it which is great                                  it's brilliant and one thing I just want                                  to throw out is that from my                                  observations it's something I want to                                  turn into a more of an operating                                  principle is that users seem to look as                                  a user's people real people seem to look                                  at websites from the point of view of                                  them being on the screen they it's the                                  stuff on the screen and it's been                                  interesting to watch people try to deal                                  with that try to make the screen look                                  different and I think you actually used                                  you've cited one example there was                                  someone was trying to build a theme when                                  there was no content whatsoever because                                  and other users in the study that you                                  did seem to be focused but they would                                  dwell on things like appearance you know                                  the the menu button for appearance                                  because it's almost as if like it's a                                  magnet and they just want to be there                                  with the website that they got in their                                  head they want it to look like that so                                  that represents a huge challenge in                                  terms of you know UX design but it's                                  also a huge clue as to how to go about                                  it and I think the phrase it's very                                  powerful there is outside in if we can                                  structure an interaction strategy from                                  outside in perspective for that set of                                  users the ones that you know you were                                  targeting there and content managers and                                  so on content providers I think that                                  could you know produce some useful sort                                  of rewarding results to achieve the                                  things that juries is wanting us to                                  achieve and it's more like the natural                                  grain it's like a wood patterns like the                                  natural grain we're not going against it                                  that's what they want to do if we can                                  reinforce that then I think the other                                  thing I just want to say Jeff it's                                  something that the power of Drupal is                                  its flexibility the fact that it's been                                  built by developers all over the world                                  and you know it's been very developer                                  oriented and then there's been a user                                  and vice sort of put on top of that I                                  think that's really the history isn't it                                  the when you have flexibility like that                                  then then you have abstraction an                                  abstraction is completely the opposite                                  to what the users that you're testing                                  the users were trying to reach are                                  actually seeing and thinking and                                  believing they're doing so that's really                                  the nature challenge how to go from                                  abstract to the specific the concrete                                  the thing I can touch if you're going                                  outside in how do you go from the                                  specific to the abstracts me even harder                                  yeah and that's what's really                                  interesting about the current                                  discussions around court context and you                                  know that's what we're going to have to                                  do is figure out how to use that                                  architecture to solve that problem I                                  think that's quite doable so just one                                  thing have you i looked at the form                                  builder module at all it's a great way                                  of rather than configuring fields which                                  is the inside-out approach you drag them                                  as they are into the flow me see them                                  outside in so there's a lot of great                                  stuff that works with any renderable                                  social a big future there for how we                                  could use that and triple to yeah I                                  think I haven't actually seen it will                                  check it out form builder and one more                                  thing you were saying about all this                                  made me think of actually we had some                                  users who when they ended up getting                                  into the advanced views user interface                                  not the simple creation wizard you know                                  like when you scroll down it'll                                  dynamically show you what the view would                                  be producing what the output would be                                  they were looking at that and thinking                                  they could look at the picture and make                                  changes to it and effect                                  what the content was they they'd see                                  that you know the table of all the                                  different filters and everything you                                  could do a fuse and I don't want to see                                  that go down they see oh it's printing                                  out the content they wanted to play with                                  that that's what they wanted to play                                  with to make it look the way they wanted                                  so I think yeah what you're saying is                                  spot-on reflected with that want to add                                  one more big thing what you you sent out                                  or you posted something about your                                  report yes I put a comment up there and                                  I told you how I'm going to be we're                                  actually going at my plant we're going                                  through those same videos and we're                                  analyzing it from a certain point of                                  view or sets a point of view I don't                                  wanna go into that now but I also I did                                  to put a link up there to my personal                                  site and there's a video there that                                  quick video that i made that just to                                  summarize the project that i did a year                                  ago that it touches on this issue i'm                                  not going to say it's directly real                                  relevant but just while people are here                                  i just wanted to explain that video a                                  bit in case the google see it using the                                  concept of I a space which we talked                                  about yesterday the idea that web pages                                  consists of a set of URLs and that is                                  very very close to that surface that                                  those users are seeing it's it's the                                  space that they're looking at what we                                  did in this project was we we built a                                  road modular basically built an entire                                  website that the click of a button the                                  website was was built on a recipe or the                                  arc me I am information architecture was                                  derived from a recipe which was it came                                  from the client that said this is what I                                  want my website to look like she was                                  able to articulate on a napkin this is                                  what it should look like so basically we                                  bypassed all of that element a site                                  building what that meant was it her                                  target users her customers who were                                  science fair teachers and science                                  teachers and organizing a science fair                                  didn't have to suffer with any of that                                  stuff they simply went to at the press                                  of a button built the site went to the                                  pages they wanted to go to press edit                                  and put the content and they wanted so                                  we did multiple clones of this of this                                  you know this kind of structure and it                                  worked very well just want to put that                                  in as a reference point and trans been                                  outside in approach from the point of                                  view content management and eliminating                                  the                                  building a hassle yeah awesome we                                  haven't watched the video yet but we're                                  really excited to see it and we're also                                  really excited that people are taking                                  the this video so we put online and like                                  actually analyzing them from completely                                  different ways like that's very cool and                                  we hope more people do that yeah I'll                                  get back to you on that two of the                                  findings in the hell thank you that back                                  in there thank you I don't actually have                                  a question but I wanted to announce that                                  we're going to have a ball tomorrow at                                                                                                            if anyone is interested in conducting                                  their own usability studies for Drupal                                  we can talk about some strategies for                                  planning study as well as like                                  communicating back to the community                                  through the group's insights like that                                  so well well yeah                                                         peter chen stanford university first off                                  great discussion i mean lots of weekend                                  lots of directions we can go from here                                  and just thinking more specifically                                  about UX and usability for people who                                  are handled dealing with the content and                                  one of the challenges that I deal with                                  is my so you know I've got a lot of                                  users who are coming from the                                  Dreamweaver paradigm and they're trying                                  to unlearn ten years of work with that                                  and so similarly one of my colleagues                                  actually is working on the library                                  library redesign project under chapter                                    has been involved so you may be                                  unfamiliar with that went through this                                  first round and they're in a lot of                                  their user training involved teaching                                  people about you know what's a node                                  what's a view what's all this and they                                  found that it ended up really confusing                                  a lot of you know librarian people and                                  so you know they so they made it the                                  second round they did more concerted                                  effort to kind of figure out what are                                  the what are the things that they                                  actually need to learn to work with the                                  UL administrative UI you know what are                                  the things that really makes it simple                                  and it wasn't about learning what a note                                  is it was really about learning about                                  what their specific domain of                                  information is what they need to edit so                                  that they understand that                                  you know coming from say for example                                  coming from the Dreamweaver paradise                                  they're not managing links to a single                                  flat page you know every time because                                  Dreamweavers already set up to build                                  those links with views and etc or if                                  it's something that goes in the in the                                  menu system so so i'm working on a                                  different project from from stu in the                                  libraries i'm actually working to school                                  of engineering one of the parent one of                                  the things i guess i try to do in                                  talking with end users or content                                  managers is trying to relate to a                                  paradigm that the experience that                                  they're working with right now and one                                  of the things i do is i say look when                                  you work with this with your managing                                  your content it should be as easy as                                  updating your status in facebook that's                                  sort of the paradigm i'm looking for and                                  that you know rather than have them                                  think that they're updating a node have                                  them think that i'm updating this by                                  writing this thing or you know putting                                  this this piece of article in there and                                  it goes and updates a node and that node                                  you know produces of you hear that ends                                  up on this homepage or ends up you know                                  on this this landing page and so forth                                  and that's really experiencing I'm                                  really aiming for with with my end users                                  at least i'd say about                                                   i mean the other twenty percent i do                                  want them to understand what a view in a                                  note isn't be more sophisticated so that                                  is a really hard problem and                                  unfortunately that problem is going to                                  be different for every single drupal                                  site ever built so it's really hard for                                  us to figure out from core like what all                                  these possible use cases are what                                  anyone's possible backgrounds are but                                  it's really important for an individual                                  site for you to figure out what that is                                  and some of the ways that we've been                                  dealing with that is building what we                                  think they need from their perspective                                  and doing a screen share and saying hey                                  do this and watching what their                                  instincts are in reacting with the                                  interface and so shouldn't say no Denny                                  wear it it's just like oh go ad an                                  article and if they're looking somewhere                                  for something we put the link right                                  there and if they're trying to interact                                  with the content a specific way if they                                  use preview a lot we fix the preview                                  problem if they're not interested in                                  preview and they just want to look at it                                  and edit and save we make sure the                                  process of going from edit to save works                                  that the Edit screen looks how they want                                  it to look and that's something that                                  needs to be tailored specifically to                                  your users in your website to make sure                                  that those things match                                  so those who didn't hear that use                                  abilities about having a use case and                                  drupal has an infinite number of use                                  cases which is part of the reason why                                  usability is so hard for gerbil so yeah                                  and just one sort of usability idea                                  around that is that you know as long as                                  your users think they know what they're                                  doing and think they understand things                                  it doesn't really matter if they're you                                  know I think you know if they don't                                  understand what a note is but they know                                  how to create article doesn't you know                                  what I mean like that abstraction is                                  fine as long as they feel comfortable                                  with it is it what's important one more                                  thanks this is probably the most                                  impactful usability study we've done                                  because of the live streaming and                                  because of you guys following through                                  which is report and the posting of the                                  videos and posting the list of issues                                  this is the test that probably gave us                                  so much the most reference material that                                  we can rough in people's face and keep                                  repeating thanks probably hard maybe not                                  even to answer of the four themes do you                                  see one that is even more worse or                                  impactful conceptual it's it comes back                                  to this whole mental model are you                                  feeling comfortable thing and if people                                  don't know what they're doing don't know                                  what they're looking at don't know where                                  they're supposed to go next have no idea                                  what they're doing like why would they                                  use Drupal yeah you know if there's no                                  there's no reason why you would try to                                  put yourself through this when you can                                  just go to another you know website                                  service that is actually specifically                                  tailored for the function of the site                                  that you're building you know like if                                  you want to build a site about recipes                                  like there's websites to help you build                                  those yeah so one thing we are running                                  short on time so we're just going to                                  take these last two questions but I                                  didn't know which one of those before is                                  the most actionable you think I mean                                  there's a big conceptual ones that I                                  need research data so conceptual is                                  definitely the most important if it's                                  actually not that depends on how we                                  solve that problem something like the                                  walkthrough or an intro video or there                                  there's definitely actionable items                                  there and I think we should focus on                                  that because if people miss the concept                                  they're not going to understand why                                  drupal's awesome like Drupal is not                                  awesome because you can create content                                  Drupal's awesome because you can create                                  content types and if people don't                                  understand that you need a content type                                  there's no reason to use Drupal all so I                                  think that's definite                                  the most important and there are things                                  we can do about it it's going to be hard                                  to like decide as a community what                                  information needs to be conveyed and how                                  you say it but it's definitely still                                  actionable one last thing for everybody                                  in the room that would like to get                                  involved it's not that easy to find your                                  place and find a spot to work on i                                  created a post in groups drupal.org /                                  usability it's the second post because                                  you have report is first which has just                                  say hi post comment there tell us what                                  you would like to do and then we'll get                                  you started Thanks thank you alright so                                  we have time for one last question um I                                  just want to say again thank you for all                                  of us I'm very excited about the sort of                                  introductory thing in the newspaper                                  model I talked to whatever his name is                                  gay thank you so bad with names and very                                  excited about that and i will start                                  following on that group and try to                                  contribute to that I mean just wanted to                                  follow up a little bit on i'm peter                                  singh and then your guys's answer to add                                  about you know that we have to sort of                                  have there's a sort of a distinction                                  between the usability for that we're                                  kind of you know this was really aimed                                  at which is like somebody installing                                  drupal and then trying to build a site                                  with it as opposed to the cases where                                  you know like which many of us do is                                  we're building a site for somebody or                                  helping them build us you know a site                                  where the end users they don't need to                                  know that it's Drupal and I think that's                                  something that all of us have site                                  builders and developers need to remember                                  is that when we build things it's our                                  responsibility to make sure the user                                  finds it easy and that they can not have                                  to know anything about Drupal yep very                                  well said thank you yeah and so if                                  anybody has any we'd love feedback on                                  the mocks or the ad even having                                  something like this so please comment                                  online or come and talk to us or come to                                  the baths tomorrow at one                                  one right all right one because yeah                                  like clearly it's not super easy to get                                  things in core but well we'd love to see                                  we'd love to see what people's thoughts                                  are about this yeah thank you thank you
