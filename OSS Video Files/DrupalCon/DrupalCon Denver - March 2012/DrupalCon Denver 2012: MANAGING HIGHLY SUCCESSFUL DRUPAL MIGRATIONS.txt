	                              good morning everybody this is managing                               highly successful Drupal migrations we                               turn the lights down so you could see                               the screen so hopefully you won't fall                               asleep so who are the folks up here I'm                               Frank febrero on the CTO of phase                                 technology Michael Morris I'm vice                               president of solutions at phase                                 technology and we do CMS and web                                application development for government                                publishing community building in the                                primarily in the DC in the New York                                markets but kind of all over the country                                some of the successful migrations that                                we've done that we won't actually talk                                about the details of those migrations                                but kind of at a more general level what                                are the things that we found successful                                across many of them but some of the ones                                that we've done is moving whitehouse gov                                from a proprietary CMS into Drupal we                                are currently migrating the agency                                websites for the state of Georgia into                                Drupal out of vignette and static sites                                moving fema gov and student to be DHS                                gov into Drupal we've done the                                washington examiner com and that was a                                Drupal to Drupal migration and other                                things like takepart com the New                                Republic in the nation an ESPN sports                                property called Bassmaster we moved                                actually out of ESPN into Drupal and the                                Wilson Center so before we get started I                                just wanted to kind of take a poll of                                the people in the audience I wanted to                                know so first i guess like who are the                                the tech folks in the room that want to                                know about like the tools that you'd use                                for migration okay who are the people                                that are just at you know on a team that                                is actually executing a migration for a                                client and who are the clients that are                                getting migrated all right so there's a                                good mix so we'll talk a little bit                                about the process that we go through                                what are some things to look for                                and kind of ways to smooth the process                                up in the top right there is a hashtag                                we call the DC migrate so if you have                                any questions while we're going you                                could just kind of send the tweet to                                that and hopefully we'll get a second to                                kind of look through them and answer the                                questions but otherwise you know when                                we're done there's there's the                                microphone in the in the center of the                                hall right there so so what's a                                migration you know a lot of talks here                                have been technical and they've been                                focused on like just the specific of                                like how do we get data from one place                                into Drupal but we're not really just                                moving kind of web pages or data when                                we're when we're migrating people to                                Drupal where we're moving their entire                                organization where we're kind of moving                                their mindset from what they used to be                                doing into kind of the way drupal makes                                you think or the way a specific                                implementation of Drupal makes you think                                and basically we're just moving the ways                                that people do their job every day into                                an entirely different system and you                                know there's there's some care that has                                to be taken when you do that in order to                                have a really smooth and efficient                                migration all right so first we want                                we're going to talk just a little bit                                about kind of like the characters at                                play when you you know that's involved                                on these projects all right so most of                                you know there's a lot of different                                people that get involved in these kinds                                of projects and we're just going to                                focus on a couple of key ones you know                                we're not going to try to be too obvious                                but there are some interesting                                characteristics about the roles are                                being played and how you may approach                                them these folks so obviously one of the                                most important are the people that are                                maintaining the content generally these                                folks are probably coming off of former                                systems that they probably don't like                                they have lots of complaints they've                                been very frustrated you know they they                                are completely dependent on things like                                WYSIWYG but yet they hate them at the                                same time because none of them are very                                 good you know some folks don't                                 understand even even basic concepts like                                 the fact that you can write a piece of                                 content once and then display it                                 anywhere you know they                                 be coming off of more kind of like                                 static web page builder type systems so                                 there's there's a lot of concepts that                                 for Drupal developers and for what web                                 developers in general that just have to                                 be explained you know they also probably                                 right really bad markup they're used to                                 being able to go in and create HTML                                 tables and put styles in there and kind                                 of do whatever they want and you know                                 most of that what we're going to get                                 into why that's all a problem later on                                 you know be really careful of features                                 that they have fallen in love with you                                 know there's probably something about                                 their old system that they really like                                 and that they want to keep so make sure                                 you ask them and you know I always keep                                 them in mind and then you have to be                                 really aware of things like you know                                 newsletter signups and analytics and ads                                 and things that the website owners have                                 have you know that are very important                                 and make sure that those kinds of things                                 don't get messed up during data                                 migration so the next group of people                                 are kind of what we call the technical                                 owners they could either be you know                                 managing the infrastructure that these                                 systems are running on but then in any                                 case they have to maintain the                                 technology and sometimes they're very                                 protective of of their environments and                                 and what you're allowed to run in so you                                 know we say up here does it run on is                                 three I mean we actually get asked those                                 questions sometimes so so you have to                                 kind of be careful like you just don't                                 come in and say oh well this is crap and                                 you have to run on you know this this                                 latest up-to-date stuff because in many                                 ways you might actually be threatening                                 their jobs so it's important to kind of                                 win them over bring them along and help                                 them understand the challenges of                                 hosting a Drupal site                                 yeah so this is when you guys all                                 probably know people like this on your                                 projects or in your organization's you                                 know this the saboteur and they                                 generally can take on different forms                                 you know a lot of cases it could be a                                 team that maybe you're replacing like a                                 previous vendor or a previous web                                 maintenance group so there's going to be                                 sensitivities to to that more times than                                 not you know in a pretty big robust web                                 site there's going to be external                                 systems involved either authentication                                 systems or data that's being pulled in                                 from various places and those systems                                 are going to have owners that you'll                                 have to interface with you know they                                 might be a little bit standoffish so you                                 know make friends with with kind of with                                 those kind of folks that you're that                                 you're going to depend on to complete                                 your job security guys you know security                                 is really important obviously it's a                                 huge focus there's been a lot of                                 presentations here at drupalcon about it                                 you know you know I'm not trying to                                 paint them in a bad light but you know                                 just to be aware that you know you'll                                 have to do things and check boxes and do                                 testing and we actually talked about                                 secure view later in this but you know I                                 have run into a few security people over                                 you know over the years that that you                                 know tend to be blockers more more than                                 helpers and then outside auditors that's                                 another thing that you may encounter                                 folks that have to come in and review                                 code and review project management                                 processes and things like that so you                                 know I'm not saying they're all bad                                 they're not all trying to sabotage your                                 project but they there's you know                                 characteristics and elements about those                                 folks you have to you know you really                                 have to adapt to their way of thinking                                 in order to go to work with them another                                 one is you know hopefully there's always                                 a project champion so hopefully somebody                                 who owns the website whether they're                                 paying the bill for it or whether they                                 are you know an evangelist of the                                 technology or whatever luckily there's                                 always going to be somebody on your side                                 so identify those folks use them to your                                 advantage make sure that they can help                                 you                                 in return you know communicate with them                                 very clearly and effectively make sure                                 that you're staying within scope and on                                 budget and on schedule and you know                                 first and foremost make sure that they                                 feel they're really getting value out of                                 the work that you're doing make sure                                 that they feel like you know there's a                                 good reason that we're migrating this                                 you know all of this content and moving                                 a website from some of the technology to                                 to Drupal or even from Drupal to Drupal                                 along with that our expectations so you                                 know this is a this is a really common                                 thing that we encounter a lot when we're                                 doing projects you're always sort of                                 being evaluated as Drupal really as good                                 as is everybody says it is you know how                                 you know you're being compared to like                                 former systems so you know I think again                                 it's all just like part of part of an                                 overall package and overall approach to                                 a project that when you're dealing with                                 different individuals try to key in key                                 in on the things that they're that are                                 important to them and make sure that                                 you're addressing their concerns and                                 setting the project up for success yeah                                 I mean one of the reasons that we have a                                 section called people is that you know                                 I'm assuming that most people here can                                 actually execute a good site build and                                 technically perform everything that's                                 needed to to have a successful launch                                 but if you overlook the people aspect                                 and the organizational aspect of getting                                 somebody onto a new platform I mean a                                 simply bad handling of people can cause                                 something to be perceived as a failure                                 as instead of a success                                 and i'll talk about preparation all                                 right so this is a big one this is                                 without a doubt one of the most                                 difficult parts of any migration project                                 is estimating it and I wish I had some                                 kind of silver bullet that I could you                                 know provide to you that that is a                                 surefire way of making sure that your                                 estimates are are perfect every time but                                 uh no ours are so you know you have to                                 really factor in a lot of things need to                                 factor an organizational complexity how                                 many people are going to be involved you                                 know every person kind of adds a                                 communication line and those factors                                 start to build up you know look at how                                 many up there's a couple different ways                                 to try to estimate you can sort of think                                 of like well how many peoples are going                                 to take to do this you know how many                                 developers may need to write scripts how                                 many QA folks am I going to need you can                                 also look at you know just historical                                 evidence if you've done it before I mean                                 that's obviously one of the most common                                 ways to try to do estimation and then                                 some of its just got feel you know if                                 you're going in and looking at the data                                 and you're like man there's just a lot                                 of stuff in here that doesn't look good                                 you know sometimes it's a little bit of                                 a gut instinct I think that the most                                 successful way to try to do the actual                                 move of the data itself and today we're                                 kind of talking about a lot of things                                 but we will talk about actually moving                                 content from one system to another try                                 to get a look at it first you know don't                                 just throw a number out there based on                                 the number of pages you know really look                                 at the source data try to evaluate it                                 understand how complex it is understand                                 the relationships and then you have to                                 sort of factor all this in and and give                                 some kind of estimate so and then kind                                 of how you present the estimate and a                                 lot of cases will will affect the                                 opinion of it if you go incredibly                                 detailed to a line item number where you                                 have like tasks estimated at one hour                                 you know you might be conveying a false                                 sense of fidelity that you know every                                 single thing that's going to happen and                                 and down to the hour or half hour how                                 long everything's going to take so you                                 have to be careful kind of with the                                 level of detail that you go into with                                 your estimates because you might be you                                 know setting up the wrong x x                                 stations so when you do a migration                                 there's lots of opportunity you're                                 coming out of a lot of times old systems                                 you know unstructured content things                                 like that and it's a really great                                 opportunity to reorganize the content so                                 don't necessarily just you know take                                 these blobs of HTML and move them over                                 into a new system directly move the data                                 into the new technology so reevaluate                                 your information architecture and your                                 navigation whether you go from                                 unstructured to structure it if that's                                 actually possible you know evaluate a                                 better use of taxonomy and navigational                                 structures and obviously it's a great                                 time to refresh stale outdated designs                                 and sometimes brands yeah I'll add to                                 that too I mean one of the things that                                 we encounter a lot is you you really                                 have to do this in order to even get the                                 project paid for sometimes I mean it's                                 it's a hard sell to just say well i'm                                 just going to replace the underlying                                 technology but you know the people that                                 are paying for that will like well so                                 what's different you know what i really                                 get out of it they may not really                                 understand the value of that so it                                 really is good too when you're going to                                 undertake all of this technical lift to                                 try to make a move like this make sure                                 that you're giving the stakeholders and                                 the users of the site and the readers                                 something out of it by making it look                                 better making it navigate better and                                 making the content better so it's a                                 really good opportunity to kind of take                                 a holistic approach to improvements so                                 site architecture is another thing that                                 that you obviously encounter when you're                                 building a new site in Drupal and you                                 have to basically I mean it goes without                                 saying you have to take into account the                                 needs of the organization and what                                 they're trying to do with their content                                 and how how everything is going to be                                 structured there's no sense in moving                                 over all this content and doing like a                                 big a big lift there to be to be putting                                 it in a platform that's either flimsy                                 are not suited to to their goals so some                                 of the decisions that you have to make                                 you know are you going to build their                                 site on a distribution something like                                 open public or open academy or something                                 like that is are you building a platform                                 for them so are you basically building a                                 customer specific distribution that can                                 support                                 multiple sites whether through your                                 standard multi-site or something more                                 like a virtual site or a domain access                                 model are you going to use organic                                 groups and then you know kind of take it                                 down another level do all the tools that                                 they need already exist or are you going                                 to have to start creating some tools or                                 some concepts that don't exist so you're                                 going to have to create new layers of                                 functionality that that kind of combine                                 many building blocks that are already                                 out there a lot of these decisions you                                 should know upfront there's nothing                                 worse than kind of being three-quarters                                 of the way through a project and you                                 don't really know how you're going to                                 solve a particular tricky aspect of how                                 they want to present data or organize                                 their content only to be presented with                                 the fact that you actually can't or it's                                 going to require you know another month                                 just to get it done this was pretty                                 self-explanatory but we felt pretty                                 obligated to talk about it I mean                                 clearly any project that's going to be                                 successful requires good communication                                 good planning you know one of the things                                 that we're always grappling with is kind                                 of the right level of transparency you                                 know we work for a lot of people that                                 really want to see every little detail                                 you know they want to get into our                                 ticketing system and evaluate you know                                 every single thing and that can be great                                 but you know they're also going to be                                 seeing the sausage being made and that's                                 not always a great thing so yeah this is                                 you know make sure you have good project                                 management good folks that can plan out                                 these activities because it's you know                                 there's a lot more to it then than just                                 simply the technical aspects of it which                                 is what we're going to get into next so                                 some tools and some tips not these kind                                 of tools but we're going to talk about                                 technical aspects and some                                 considerations when migrating so the                                 first thing we're going to talk about                                 our data sources Mike said earlier it's                                 important to get a look at the data that                                 you're that you're moving from and you                                 know some things that you need to really                                 carefully evaluate is what format is the                                 data in are you getting it at                                 spreadsheets is it static HTML files                                 direct database access sometimes you get                                 these proprietary formats and if you get                                 those do you                                 the right libraries in order to kind of                                 extract and investigate the data is it                                 structured or unstructured content like                                 kind of the differences is it just some                                 blob of HTML that represents a page or                                 do you have the title separate than the                                 subtitle is the author separated or is                                 there a separate section for tags a lot                                 of that will help determine the level of                                 effort required to get it into the new                                 system another question is how do you                                 access the data that that you're given                                 do they email you files do they put it                                 in a Dropbox do you have ftp access do                                 you actually have an API that you could                                 use to extract the data do you have                                 direct database access and a really                                 important thing are you actually relying                                 on other people in their organization to                                 give you this data and if so like what's                                 their responsiveness and then other                                 things to consider is when you when                                 you're looking at the data where are you                                 migrating it is it all going into nodes                                 is it going into taxonomy is do you have                                 to build menu structures what about                                 media things like images PDFs video do                                 they want to migrate like their blocks                                 and call outs and you know the little                                 custom ads that they might put on the                                 sides do they want to actually migrate                                 landing pages themselves or those going                                 to be built after the facts so when                                 we're talking about moving data it's                                 important to get a process that you can                                 kind of run it verify rewind it so                                 basically pull the data back out tweak                                 it and run it again so getting these                                 automated processes of moving data is                                 very important for verification and also                                 having a dedicated content verification                                 system that isn't the system you're                                 developing at that time so another thing                                 is when you're moving data especially                                 from an old system that might actually                                 have something resembling structured                                 data if you're going to be able to run                                 it rewind it and repeat it or update                                 just individual content items as you                                 tweak your migration it's really                                 important to track what the legacy ID of                                 these items are and what this the new                                 source system destination is so that you                                 could do selective upgrades and another                                 thing is do things like create reports                                 that have content that you might think                                 that there's a discrepancy in or                                 something that needs to be reviewed it's                                 great if you could somehow identify                                 content that you think could be a                                 problem so that there's a checklist for                                 people to verify so some specifically                                 some ways of moving data from one site                                 to another you could do direct sequel                                 queries out of one database into another                                 you could you could extract data through                                 RSS or atom or XML out of one system and                                 then use a module like feeds to import                                 it into your new system you could use                                 the views module like let's say you're                                 moving from an older Drupal system you                                 could you could add the views module if                                 it's not already there and you could                                 create api's to get it there data as XML                                 or JSON and then use that with modules                                 like migraine or you know custom scripts                                 that you've written to transition the                                 data from one system to the other so I                                 mentioned the migrate module which is a                                 really great you know oo approach to                                 doing automated migration and transfers                                 it kind of has like a pipeline process                                 where you can do you could tweak the                                 data and reformat it and structure it on                                 the way in and then there's also                                 professional services like aqua is                                 migration service so you could actually                                 outsource it if you think it's a heavy                                 lift or it's a system that you're                                 completely unfamiliar with it's a                                 technology you've never seen you feel                                 too intimidated or you want somebody                                 else to be on the hook Frank why don't                                 you talk a little bit about the                                 importance of going through you know                                 like node saves and things like that                                 versus just writing directly and                                 database yeah so as you're building the                                 system a lot of times modules will                                 they'll kind of intercept save                                 operations and do things like like when                                 you save a node through the through the                                 node edit form it'll take the title and                                 will create a path Elias port so you can                                 have a clean URL so if you just extract                                 your your content from a source system                                 and put it right into the node tables                                 you miss operations like that that                                 happened and you have to account for                                 them so that's why modules like migrate                                 are really efficient is because they                                 actually put content through the normal                                 saving process and updating process that                                 it would go through as you were using                                 the CMS yourself so a lot of things like                                 you know if you have automated tagging                                 services or like I said path audio path                                 aliases and things like that so                                 so once all this data makes it over                                 usually looks perfect right no boy I                                 mean it's so this is where the fun                                 starts you know for for folks like me I                                 don't do a lot of the script writing                                 anymore but you know I I work with the                                 teams that are doing QA and kind of                                 looking at this data and trying to make                                 sure that you know we're getting an                                 actual nice looking website out of it so                                 you know you'll see you'll find                                 everything you'll find everything from                                 just poorly formed HTML you see a lot of                                 sometimes really crazy stuff people will                                 just take embedded JavaScript and you                                 know flash tags or whatever just things                                 that if they had the flexibility to put                                 whatever they wanted to in the body of                                 the content of the former system you                                 know if they had the ability to then                                 they definitely did and then other                                 things which aren't you know aren't                                 quite as malicious but are things that                                 they do in line links so if they're                                 linking within their website and they're                                 hard coding paths and things like that                                 inline styles you know you always                                 encounter a lot of styles and you have                                 to make sure that you are handling those                                 properly either have equivalent styles                                 on the new system that can match up and                                 can kind of highlight you know treat                                 block quotes and things like that the                                 same way or come up with translations so                                 you know writing scripts that will grab                                 a style and rename it to something else                                 to a new style that that's gonna that's                                 going to match your new theme let's talk                                 a little bit just about like what are                                 some of the good and bad things about                                 moving data so if you just move the data                                 from wherever it was to your new system                                 it'll work but it's not necessarily the                                 best thing you know something better                                 might be like I mentioned earlier too as                                 you're moving the data over I try to                                 identify if there's things like there's                                 embedded links and there's there's like                                 links to PDFs or image references flag                                 them so that at least you can have a                                 list of things that people need to                                 review manually even better is to                                 perform scripted cleanup so as you're                                 migrating the data use things like                                 regular expressions and and strip out                                 inline styles                                 and then you know kind of the best thing                                 over there is as you're moving data and                                 you're cleaning it up to also translate                                 asset resources and embedded embedded                                 links so that the content went to hit                                 you in your system is is perfect so what                                 are some of the cleaning supplies that                                 you could use to actually do the cleanup                                 that we just mentioned so regular                                 expressions is fourth on this list but                                 it's really number one most of the time                                 you wind up having to do things like                                 strip out bad tags and translate tags                                 and regular expressions are really like                                 a great thing for that but there are                                 other tools out there like Google refine                                 like sometimes people think Google                                 refine is really just like a spreadsheet                                 tool but it actually allows you to do                                 like a lot of data manipulation and and                                 changes across whole whole swathes of                                 data so if you're getting your data in                                 spreadsheet format this is actually                                 sometimes a really good tool and even in                                 other cases if it's not given to you in                                 spreadsheet format sometimes you might                                 want to export it into a CSV move it                                 into refine do some tweaks pull it back                                 out as a CSV and put it into the                                 database again so so it could be a many                                 step process to clean up your data so                                 you can consider it like a pipeline and                                 each step has as its goals and that's                                 what you that's what you do with Yahoo                                 pipes you can actually put together                                 these pipelines of content processing to                                 go from one source of content to to like                                 a finalized source and it works really                                 good if you have feed data like RSS or                                 atom and then another thing is uh things                                 like XPath and xslt if you want to                                 actually dive into the mark-up itself if                                 it's well-structured HTML you could dive                                 into the mark-up identify and remove                                 certain tags and xpath is actually one                                 of the good tools for identifying things                                 that you might want to flag later                                 so there's a lot more than just markup                                 it's being brought over you know                                 everybody has lots of different things                                 on their website obviously we find lots                                 of images and videos and assets lots                                 Pete PDFs you know usually there's some                                 treasure trove of some folder that has                                 you know thousands or hundreds of                                 thousands of PDFs that had to be pulled                                 over and you know those those assets are                                 being linked to all throughout the                                 mark-up so you really kind of need to be                                 prepared to spend a lot of time in this                                 area you know you have to one of the                                 things we encounter are you know like                                 access control issues so if you're                                 building a site that has kind of group                                 based permissions you need to think                                 about where the files are being stored                                 and usually they're probably coming just                                 out of a file that you're out of a                                 directory that may have sub directories                                 and you need to either maintain some                                 kind of division on the on the other                                 side or come up with some other plans so                                 there's usually something that asks if                                 you work through there like and I                                 already mentioned but there's always                                 going to be references to these things                                 so again that's where you know the                                 previous stuff retama you got to write                                 scripts to go in if you're pointing to                                 if you if you you know you can keep the                                 same path that you had in the old system                                 that's a might be fine but if you can't                                 even make sure that you you translate                                 them and another thing to consider is                                 you know in a lot of older systems you                                 would you'd link directly to a PDF but                                 in something like drupal you could have                                 fields that are specifically for                                 referencing images and and uploads so                                 you might you might need to consider                                 figuring out which things are embedded                                 and moving those into a more structured                                 asset relationship if you're going to                                 use that field to for example display a                                 list of like related attachments or                                 something like that so then also when                                 you're moving things like like media                                 specifically like images and video where                                 you where are they going so they were                                 probably just in a directory in the old                                 system are you going to maintain the the                                 self-hosted video and images or you're                                 going to move them to something like                                 Vimeo or Brightcove or YouTube which is                                 which is much better or you're going to                                 actually move them to something like a                                 content delivery network                                 and if you do things like that you might                                 have to have URL redirects in order to                                 make sure that their reference properly                                 and then also also when you're moving                                 are there media player changes are you                                 going to use like a different a                                 different player yeah in a lot of cases                                 depending on the video solution you know                                 we don't always recommend a different                                 one if you're if you've already got                                 Brightcove and Vimeo and that's working                                 great or YouTube you know YouTube embeds                                 work really well and you know we're not                                 always suggesting you have to go out and                                 get some high-priced video solution but                                 at a minimum you've got to think about                                 how how those that content gets moved                                 over and or at least references to it                                 you know in the case of like YouTube in                                 beds and things like that so you know                                 there's always like some trickery                                 involved in moving over and when you                                 move to a service you also have to                                 consider how are they going to be adding                                 new ones are you going to integrate that                                 through a WYSIWYG is it through a media                                 field a video embed URL or something                                 like that so those are more things to                                 consider legacy URLs are always a very                                 fun very fun situation to be dealing                                 with and it's really tricky to you know                                 there's some there's some bad ways to do                                 it like having no redirects whatsoever                                 in which case you're going to lose a lot                                 of traffic you'll probably fall on your                                 google rankings considerably there's                                 really bad things to do like like                                 generating over a hundred thousand                                 redirects and then putting them in a                                 dynamically loaded file like an HT                                 Access file and then wondering why every                                 single page load takes                                            there's other solutions like the global                                 redirect module which basically                                 bootstraps Drupal it when there are                                    fours it actually looks to see if                                 there's a redirect and and then it will                                 send you there well that's that's good                                 because you could be reviewing the                                 Google Analytics or other analytics and                                 figure out what the remaining                                           are and then use this module to account                                 for them as well the bad part is that                                 you actually have to load up                                 drupal for a request that's just going                                 to be a redirect some better things are                                 to do pattern-based redirects so some                                 type of regular expression that you                                 could put in like a statically loaded                                 web server configuration those can be                                 executed pretty quickly especially if                                 you're using something pattern-based you                                 might only have to evaluate you know                                    or                                                                   then ideally you'd do something like                                 redirects at the edge and what the edge                                 means is like if you're using something                                 like a content delivery network a lot of                                 times they'll have support for redirects                                 so the best redirect is one that doesn't                                 have to get to your site until you're                                 actually loading the page that they're                                 after Frank what's the best way to keep                                 track of URLs that come from an old                                 system and you know those get delivered                                 and like a spreadsheet and they have to                                 get parsed and put into some kind of                                 like what's the best like process for                                 actually doing that yeah so a lot of                                 times you could use like a lot of times                                 what we'll do is we'll look at some adil                                 enix like google analytics will take                                 like the top                                                          there and we'll see well judy's actually                                 maintain their their paths from one                                 system to the other and then if not                                 you'll you'll determine from this path                                 to this other path you'll create a                                 spreadsheet and then you could sometimes                                 automatically generate through regular                                 expressions or something like that                                 through you know a scripting language                                 like pearl you could generate what the                                 redirects would look like yeah and the                                 number of redirects that you ultimately                                 choose I mean it's kind of up to you um                                 you know a good starting point is to                                 take your you know top                                                  pages but you know for for a lot of                                 sites that's just not good enough you                                 have to you have to keep track of every                                 single one of them and that's where some                                 of these other you know you can't just                                 dump all those into your HT Access file                                 or you'll have big problems but it's                                 really important to monitor your site in                                 in like the the few months after launch                                 to see what what is still a                                             could use your web server logs for                                 things like that it's really easy to                                 filter out based on status code for                                 those that don't know a                                             status code mean it's not found so you                                 can filter your access logs for                                     so once the content is you know once                                 you've done a lot of these things it's                                 absolutely crucial that the people that                                 are that can evaluate the content                                 because nobody's going to know the                                 content better than the folks that                                 maintain the website you've got to get                                 them in early and this is where you've                                 got to be willing to kind of let them                                 see stuff that's a work in progress and                                 they need to understand that it's a work                                 in progress and evaluate it                                 appropriately but you know very early                                 review you know get them involved and is                                 like the iterative process you know let                                 them know like you know you're going to                                 run a new you're going to you're going                                 to rerun your scripts like you know                                 every night and they can come in the                                 next day and see how how much better                                 they've gotten so that's that's                                 obviously really important yeah I just                                 said some of that so make sure you run                                 it multiple times another really tricky                                 thing is trying to coordinate the mic                                 the moving of content with the building                                 of the website that will host the new                                 content and with Drupal this is an                                 interesting problem because you can make                                 you know sometimes you know the theme                                 your whole theming process might be                                 running like a little bit behind the                                 rest of your development process and you                                 may have a site you know we call it a a                                 skeleton site or a nun theme site and if                                 you want to be using that to kind of                                 stage your content migration that's                                 great make sure you explain that how to                                 make sure that the person that's doing                                 the reviewing on the stakeholder side                                 make sure that you kind of trust that                                 they can evaluate the content without                                 having to see it in its perfect final                                 form which is sort of the best thing to                                 do if possible if you can if you have                                 enough time and you can coordinate some                                 of these things in more of a series then                                 you can actually be pushing content in                                 to a staging site that's that's pretty                                 fully built out it's got most of the                                 functionality it's already been themed                                 and it will sort of feel a lot more                                 comfortable to someone who's trying to                                 evaluate the effectiveness of the                                 migration and when you're doing this and                                 you know this is a slide I wanted to put                                 in here because believe it or not this                                 is something that can really be                                 confounding to folks if you're not                                 really careful but generally in a                                 project like this you're going to have                                 multiple                                 environments you're going to have an                                 integration environment we're developer                                 codes coming together you're going to                                 have a staging environment where you're                                 looking at content and you know you may                                 have a production environment which you                                 will at some point make sure that you're                                 very clear about what is happening on                                 each of these environments make sure                                 that you're naming them correctly with                                 subdomains or something like that make                                 sure that the folks that are looking at                                 the content understand that they might                                 like I'll just give you scenario I'm                                 looking at a piece of content that got                                 pulled in from an automated script and                                 I'm looking at it and I see problems and                                 when I'm seeing problems I'm actually                                 seeing like functional bugs like oh well                                 this this navigation thing didn't work                                 right or this widget didn't work right                                 and it has nothing to do with the                                 content but it's natural that people are                                 going to find those kinds of bugs so                                 they're going to report those bugs and                                 then you fix them but you might not be                                 fixing them on the actual content                                 staging site you might want to fix them                                 in another site so it's it's pretty                                 common for us especially in big ones                                 where we try to keep our content                                 environment fairly stable because you                                 don't want it to be constantly changing                                 you want to be able to you know kind of                                 compare apples to apples when you're                                 when you're doing these iterative runs                                 of your scripts and it's hard to do that                                 if you're trying to change like all                                 these variables at one time if you're                                 fixing a bunch of bugs and functionality                                 and doing a bunch of theming changes and                                 trying to do content migration all at                                 the same time and people trying to you                                 know do manual tweaks of content which                                 we're going to talk about it a minute                                 and it just gets really confusing so                                 just make sure that you're very you                                 delineate these environments very                                 carefully use something like the                                 environment indicator module or you know                                 put a big red flashing banner or                                 something on you know so people can                                 understand what what site they're                                 actually on social and semantic                                 integration so these are things to test                                 as you're migrating content as you're                                 building outside functionality like have                                 you implemented Open Graph tags have you                                 tested what your articles will look like                                 if somebody shares it on Facebook or                                 shares it with Twitter like these are                                 all things that you should go through as                                 part of your process to get into more of                                 like the                                 semantic web and technical aspects that                                 help with search like have you specified                                 rdfa properties for your content through                                 through the Drupal hooks are you not                                 using rdfa are using something like                                 microformats or micro data you know have                                 you and then once you've specified these                                 things have you sent them through a                                 validator to validate that they're                                 actually readable and that they're                                 structured correctly and this should be                                 part of the process all along it's very                                 easy to have you know some potential                                 theming changes actually mess up your                                 you're Micro data or idea rdf a markup                                 so part of the process you should always                                 be a verification of these things and                                 you know one of my favorites is I think                                 you should always use that meebo toolbar                                 that thing is awesome sits at the bottom                                 of your site and pops things up all over                                 the place it's really great and loads                                 really fast too yeah it's just site fast                                 code reviews so this isn't really part                                 of like a data migration and this is I                                 think just the best practice in in every                                 site build code reviews are important                                 because having many eyes on your code                                 makes it better it catches bugs and the                                 important thing is keeping the customers                                 happy through a migration and and when                                 they're moving to a new tool if they see                                 things constantly breaking or if they                                 report a bug and you fix it but when you                                 fix it you break something else like                                 that that kind of erodes their                                 confidence in the system so you know                                 code review should be trying to ensure                                 things like consistency and reuse in                                 isolation like like one thing that that                                 could be a big problem is you know                                 something might not be themed correctly                                 in one in one place and when you update                                 the CSS it actually unstyled another                                 page so trying to look for things like                                 overlapping CSS selectors things like                                 hard coding the pre process data munging                                 like views hook preprocess to to shift                                 data around or reformat it a lot those                                 things can actually affect negatively                                 how the site looks and and how it                                 functions and how stable it is so you                                 know not everybody has an organization                                 big enough to have multiple eyes looking                                  at code but you know so if you just have                                  one guy and that's all you have then                                  that's great but ideally you'll have                                  many eyes looking at your                                  if you use a system like github to                                  develop your site there are these things                                  called pull requests so if you have                                  multiple people working on a code base                                  they can each fork it into their own                                  repositories and then basically issue                                  requests to have that code reintegrated                                  in with the main line and it's a good                                  opportunity it's like it's basically                                  like a gate where the code has to come                                  through a gate and someone has to look                                  at it and they could say okay everything                                  looks good there's nothing out of out of                                  whack and sometimes like you might not                                  review every single line of code but                                  it's a good indication like if it's a                                  ticket to to fix the blog you know a                                  blog feature that you have and in                                  looking at the code change you realize                                  that there's actually like a whole bunch                                  of changes to some module that you never                                  even considered it's like a good                                  opportunity to go look and say oh did                                  they mess up something while they were                                  doing it and a tool that we use and we                                  like a lot is a tool called crucible                                  from a company called atlassian and it's                                  actually a formal code review tool that                                  allows you to upload change sets or                                  whole files or whole modules or whole                                  sites and it allows for threaded                                  discussions on any given line of code so                                  it's a it's a really good tool for                                  ensuring uniformity and making sure that                                  other people are looking at your code                                  the tool it's called crucible yep                                  security reviews those are also                                  important I'm very important you know                                  and some for some clients it's more                                  important than others but in general a                                  half site is bad for everybody it's bad                                  for your client it's bad for the                                  company's perception of you and your                                  work and it's bad for Drupal so we think                                  code review security reviews are also                                  important so you know there you could do                                  nun and you know for some people that's                                  perfectly acceptable as long as you                                  follow like secure coding practices in                                  Drupal there's actually a page on                                  drupal.org about it things like check                                  you know check plane and verifying                                  content and using input filters                                  correctly in in the HTML text areas but                                  then you could also do automated tests                                  you could use tools like drupal scout                                  there's aqua insight tools for security                                  there's also automated penetration                                  testing tools that you could use and                                  then the last one which really only                                  applies in a very small number of case                                  is IV and V is independent verification                                  and validation and it's basically having                                  a third party come in and perform a                                  security audit it usually involves you                                  giving them the code and they perform                                  what's called static code analysis where                                  they have ways to scan the code to look                                  for bad practices like things that might                                  be sequel injections cross sites and                                  then and then they'll run tests against                                  a stood up instance of your site to test                                  for things like cross-site scripting                                  attacks which can actually compromise                                  administrators so that's the tools and                                  tips part now we're going to talk a                                  little bit about the transition which is                                  kind of as your as you're finishing up                                  you know a lot of the work and you're                                  and you're preparing to go live so some                                  of this stuff is probably                                  self-explanatory so we'll try to move                                  through a little bit quickly so we can                                  have time to get some questions going                                  you know obviously training is is really                                  really key when you're doing this kind                                  of thing it generally takes longer than                                  you think it does there's a lot of                                  different ways of doing it you know I'm                                  a big fan of the good ole in person                                  let's all get in a room let's put                                  everything up on the screen let's go                                  through it let's spend a lot you know a                                  lot of time together I even like to get                                  people I think it's a good good                                  technique to get them out of their                                  office like have them come to you know                                  if you're building the site you know                                  away from their office like get them out                                  of there like daily work routine you                                  know don't let them check email and all                                  that kind of stuff there's a lot of                                  other ways too obviously screencasts are                                  really cool they are really helpful I                                  finally tend to get out of date pretty                                  quickly so screencasts are usually our                                  best success we've had with doing                                  screencast type training is in little                                  small pieces like you know a minute long                                  or five minute long like a little little                                  thing that can kind of they can just go                                  back in reference fairly quickly I think                                  if you're going to put together like a                                  really long you know                                                     video you could probably regret that so                                  it'll probably be out of date pretty                                  quick I think the screencast that                                  actually work best are when you do a                                  training just record it and then you                                  could post it for them to look at later                                  because a lot of times a training you're                                  just you're kind of overwhelming them                                  it's like an hour                                  or two or three hours of all this new                                  stuff and sometimes they're still                                  thinking about old things you've shown                                  them as you're going over new things so                                  it's helpful to have this so that they                                  could go back and reference and kind of                                  watch it a few times and understand it                                  and then sometimes you can't always get                                  people in the same room and you don't                                  want to necessarily have to perform the                                  same training again and again and again                                  so if you actually if you actually                                  record that training they could just                                  share it internally to their                                  organization yeah they can also share                                  documents and obviously doing                                  documentation is is a good way again                                  that's probably one thing I wouldn't                                  like go super overboard on we we like                                  more of kind of like a quick start week                                  even called a quick start guide or more                                  of a reference guide put some                                  screenshots in there like some of the                                  most commonly performed tasks like you                                  know entering in an article or you know                                  creating a menu item or whatever so but                                  there's a lot of ways of doing that um                                  when you're going through this you know                                  usually we're trying to time training to                                  happen right before the time when we                                  give everybody the keys to the new house                                  so they've been trained they get their                                  logins they go in and this is when you                                  know if you've done a really good job                                  this can go really smooth or you know                                  all hell could break loose so your folks                                  are seeing the site for the first time                                  they're seeing all of their content in                                  there they're starting to visualize it                                  you know they're going back and they're                                  scrutinizing it against their design                                  comps and they're checking their                                  requirements lists and things like that                                  so have a really good QA and feedback                                  loop I think this is where I see a lot                                  of organizations kind of fall down in                                  this and it sounds really simple but it                                  really does take like a really good                                  process make sure that there are ways                                  that the people that are reviewing the                                  site can can you know submit bugs to you                                  either through some kind of system or                                  you know shared google docs even might                                  be okay I mean it tends to can get a                                  little bit out of hand you know we tend                                  to use we use JIRA another atlassian                                  product and you know we've used it for                                  ten years and we love it so if you don't                                  have some kind of ticketing system you                                  should get one if visibility is the most                                  important thing they want to know that                                  that people have looked at or calm                                  ten or even just acknowledge the fact                                  that they've accepted these uh you know                                  the feedback that you're getting and                                  then also it might be it's a good                                  opportunity if they actually have access                                  to your system to put you know to ask                                  them for things like clarification like                                  they might say this isn't working and                                  then you'll say well can you give me a                                  screenshot or detailed steps to                                  reproduce it yeah we also use another                                  atlassian plug-in called bonfire which                                  is kind of cool because you can start                                  testing sessions and do screenshots and                                  submit test tickets right in right into                                  the ticketing system which is kind of                                  nice give your folks plenty of time to                                  prepare their content for their launch                                  you know do not schedule the completion                                  of your automated migration you know                                  right up to the day before they're                                  supposed to launch you know I think                                  minimum several weeks you know a month                                  is is not too long to give give people                                  time to be comfortable with their                                  content you know start working on their                                  homepage because that's going to be the                                  most important thing to them and then                                  you know there might be just a lot of                                  manual work that has to happen they may                                  be like they want to go back into some                                  archives and do some tagging now that                                  they've got taxonomy in place so just                                  give give your the editors like plenty                                  of time to go in there and do that and                                  that actually impacts how you do your                                  migration so if your migration is just                                  one big move everything at once and you                                  want to do it a few weeks before launch                                  then that means potentially two weeks of                                  dual content entry until you launch so                                  another way that you could do it is you                                  can build your migrations to have I                                  guess what they call high water mark so                                  you know you you track what the last                                  what the last piece of content that you                                  imported was or what the date was and                                  then you could start again from that                                  point forward so you could just move                                  subsets of your content over so you can                                  move it over a month before and then the                                  following Monday you can move over that                                  last week's worth of work and each                                  Monday you can move over the previous                                  week or each night you can move over                                  yesterday's content so developing the                                  migration scripts can actually help with                                  the content                                  oh and also remember to clear out test                                  content before you go live remove all                                  the pictures of cats right so one of the                                  things that we do is is is early in the                                  process we actually add flags to all of                                  our content that allows you to just hit                                  a check box and mark it as test so then                                  later on when you're going live one of                                  the steps that you have is you you                                  search for everything that has this test                                  check box and then you could just kind                                  of bulk delete them all at the same time                                  you can also add flags for like final so                                  if editors looked at a piece of content                                  and they're completely happy with it and                                  just market final and then they know                                  that like don't touch it then you could                                  run reports and tell them how much of                                  you know what percentage of their                                  content has been reviewed and like where                                  you are at various steps in the process                                  pre-launch this is always the fun part                                  you know one of the things that we try                                  to do is really pick the launch date                                  carefully taking into account weekend's                                  holidays vacations things like that I                                  mean I can't tell you how many times                                  we've had clients try to launch a site                                  on like December                                                         that it's like the week between                                  Christmas and New Year's a lot of people                                  take vacation or or somebody wanted to                                  launch their site on january first and                                  things like that so so really work hard                                  and plan with the client and be                                  reasonable and and you know ideally you                                  can be done and launched and in the                                  production that what we call I guess a                                  pre production environment for a week                                  and then it's really just a matter of                                  flipping switch and I would also expect                                  it to slip because you know that's just                                  kind of way things work right i mean                                  most of the slips that we see are often                                  you know it's not that we didn't get                                  something done it's that the                                  organization that owns the website is                                  just not ready to go you know they                                  haven't had enough eyes on the content                                  they haven't gotten various approvals                                  you know or they decide the last minute                                  they want to add some more stuff so                                  there's any number of things that kind                                  of push that launch date back but you                                  know for for the developers I kind of be                                  prepared for this I don't expect your                                  development team to just drop off the                                  face of the earth like the day of the                                  plan launched you know make sure that                                  you've got some time to to deal with                                  shift                                  launch date because it will almost                                  always happen yeah and another thing is                                  have checklists as your as you're                                  building the site there are things that                                  you know you're going to have to pay                                  attention to on launch day whether it's                                  adding an API keys or checking that                                  analytics are working that the ad server                                  is working that commenting is working                                  all these things so bill checklists                                  assign them to people who have the                                  responsibility of verifying that they're                                  that they're done you could even do                                  things like set calendar invites or or                                  if you use a tool like like base camp or                                  atrium and if you like set up basic like                                  like tickets in your ticket system to                                  make sure that people perform these                                  actions and assign them due dates yeah                                  we always even go in and like just go                                  look at how user like the settings on                                  user accounts and make sure that you                                  don't accidentally have the ability for                                  just people to anonymously create                                  accounts so there you know it's work on                                  a checklist and you know as you do lots                                  of sites over time like build it up and                                  you know ours is probably about this                                  long now and you know we go in and just                                  check every little thing even if we are                                  sure that it's been done we you know we                                  double check it another thing we do is                                  what we call disaster scenarios so like                                  if you have a multi server environment                                  plan for what happens if the database                                  server fails and the way you test that                                  is have your site running in the pre                                  production environment and turn off the                                  database and see what happens and then                                  basically you'll run through all of                                  these plans these disaster scenarios and                                  then you have like a book that you                                  execute well when the database fails                                  these are the five steps that I take and                                  by actually executing these scenarios                                  you figure out what your process is                                  because there's nothing worse than                                  trying to figure out how to recover from                                  something like that while your site's                                  down and you know the pressure is on so                                  get that all out of the way before hand                                  and you'll feel a lot more comfortable                                  when things go wrong you could just fall                                  back on this document that you've                                  developed based on what actually happens                                  when things when things go to basically                                  go to hell                                  and then there's launch yeah running out                                  of time so you have to prepare for                                  traffic hopefully you've done things                                  like load tests and you figured out                                  where the bottlenecks are and you                                  resolve them you know is your monitoring                                  working when you do your disaster plans                                  it's really good to have monitoring on                                  because you'll see you know does my                                  phone get a message when my database                                  server fails you know throw a load test                                  at it and try to you know try to                                  overwhelm your web server and see if you                                  get notifications that there's too many                                  Apache processes or things like that did                                  you remember to have a custom                                           did you remember to theme your                                  maintenance page because sometimes your                                  site actually will go down and if so you                                  don't that the blue Drupal like sites                                  under maintenance isn't good like at                                  least if you're going to go down have                                  something that looks really good maybe                                  make a joke of it or something like that                                  you know and then you know how's your                                  caching or your cash is configured                                  correctly do you have the right TTL                                  times like how long these cached items                                  are going to stay in your cash does the                                  cache clear reliably when you update                                  content is your search index up today so                                  a lot of things like that so the big day                                  this is always a fun one hopefully                                  everything you've done up to this point                                  makes this process go pretty smoothly                                  but you know we've certainly learned a                                  lot of lessons over the years you know                                  some fairly comical ones that we run                                  into is the client can't find the login                                  to their dns they don't know who you                                  know some some IT guy that worked there                                  like last year had an account that you                                  know where ever you know GoDaddy or                                  whatever that you know where the sites                                  hosted in like they don't know how to                                  login so I know it sounds ridiculous but                                  it can't happen so make sure that that's                                  part of your checklist that you it does                                  happen and a lot of times we'll will                                  recommend that clients log into the DNS                                  a few weeks beforehand and turn down the                                  time to live on their dns records                                  because that helps with a with a quicker                                  propagation yeah and then also have a                                  rollback strategy like you know we all                                  like to think that nothing's going to go                                  wrong in the world's great but things                                  actually go wrong so think about what                                  you're going to do like if the site goes                                  down and you can't get it back up how do                                  you recover can you revert back to the                                  old site                                  you have a static site that you could                                  put up in its place so so plan for these                                  things yeah if everything's gone really                                  well if you've done lots of great                                  marketing and your site's awesome you                                  get tons of hits and you know your                                  traffic will spike so be prepared for                                  that make sure you can kind of take that                                  first that first wave that comes in and                                  you know make sure that you've got your                                  xml sitemap and everything up to date                                  and that the you know Google and other                                  various search engines are finding the                                  content on yours on your new site yeah                                  and then there's the day after the                                  launch you know all the adrenaline is                                  gone your site's up and hopefully it's                                  running well so so you know assuming                                  that things didn't go bad like one of                                  the you know what you should be doing                                  now is just monitoring your site for                                  performance and seeing how people are                                  using it you know what we like to do a                                  lot is we like to look on Twitter and                                  Facebook and see if people what people                                  are saying about the site sometimes                                  there are problems and you don't even                                  know it and people are tweeting about it                                  and so you can kind of figure out what's                                  happening from that social media won't                                  cut you any slack when it comes to those                                  things you know and then other things to                                  consider is do you editors need access                                  to the old site for any reason to get                                  you know to migrate over other pieces of                                  content to verify things from the old                                  system to the new system because so                                  basically don't take the old site away                                  give them some access to it for some                                  period of time so that's and that's it                                  that's a that's how to manage highly                                  successful migrations are there any                                  questions                                  yeah i think somebody did                                  yeah well there's somebody at the mic so                                  actually if you go to the mic as well                                  though thank you this was very useful                                  for me I'm talking about cleaning up                                  content do you have any recommendations                                  of how we can get rid of Microsoft Word                                  coding um regular expressions so the                                  question is how do you get rid of                                  Microsoft Word encodings and a lot of                                  times it has to do with either using                                  regular expressions to strip them out or                                  you know using some some type of xslt                                  like a transformation if you could get                                  it into well-formed XHTML or something                                  like that you could sometimes use xslt                                  to transition the good pieces of content                                  out of it and leave the bad pieces                                  behind I i was i was asking if you can                                  tell a little more about the estimation                                  part i know it's always a challenge to                                  kind of size the migration effort so how                                  much detail is as appropriate usually                                  you have to sacrifice a small animal                                  first in order to get the gods right for                                  for estimation but um yeah I mean I                                  think really the key here is you need to                                  be able to get a good look at the source                                  I think you know volume is is sometimes                                  an indicator the different types of                                  content you know if you if you're                                  building a new Drupal site and you've                                  got often the way it happens is there's                                  you know there might be                                                 types that you've created but maybe                                  there's only like five pieces of content                                  coming from the old system so just try                                  to narrow down like exactly the kind of                                  content that's going to come over you                                  know like I said I we really don't have                                  a great way of doing it we you know                                  we'll do a lot of ranges so you know we                                  say we think it's going to be about this                                  big sometimes we get surprised and we've                                  done some migrations that literally just                                  take a couple of days and you know the                                  content came over really clean and this                                  it just just worked it just kind of went                                  in really nicely and we've had others                                  that really just take take a long time                                  you know several several weeks okay yeah                                  how do you usually mitigate against kind                                  of the                                  hit you're going to take to SEO as you                                  have all of these new pages that are out                                  there miss it's like a                                             canonical tags pointing back do you map                                  that out in advance or may just at a                                  high level how do you usually mitigate                                  there is yeah I mean I mean certainly                                     ones is really important that's why you                                  know when we said in the presentation                                  sometimes sometimes just having a                                  handful or you know                                                       enough and you really have to map every                                  single URL or in some cases you know we                                  will maintain aliases from from an old                                  site that's the best strategy if you                                  could maintain your aliases from one                                  site to another even if they're not good                                  or you know you don't like how they're                                  structured or they don't necessarily                                  make sense you know you're going to                                  suffer the least impact by not changing                                  them at all so then what you could do is                                  you could leave legacy ones the same but                                  have new structures for the new content                                  that they're creating yeah and then you                                  know just like all the other SEO things                                  like make sure your markup is structured                                  correctly and using h                                                   I'm sure you know we've all been hearing                                  presentations for years about that so I                                  don't need to go into details but and                                  like I said earlier if you use things                                  like rdfa or microformats or micro data                                  that can actually help your old content                                  as well as your new content hi hello                                  this was a great road map for migration                                  from the organizational point of view                                  but what about your customers that                                  actually hit the site how would you                                  integrate them into this process or                                  would you yeah that that's a question                                  that's a really good question yeah I                                  mean that probably you know we could                                  have touched on that and you know to be                                  honest we had a little we had a hard                                  time kind of figure out what exactly                                  what we want to talk about because                                  there's so many aspects to it you know I                                  think that's when you you want to do                                  usability tests you want to get your                                  audience involved very early on focus                                  groups yeah running focus groups                                  identifying the the different audience                                  types that are that are reading your                                  site you know you can run usability                                  tests on you know very early like you                                  know wireframes or design comps so yeah                                  there's a lot of in fact i'm sure                                  there's been a lot of sessions here this                                  week about that so I'd encourage you to                                  to find more out about that but yeah and                                  you know back when we had the the slide                                  with the funny guy from the                                          refresh and reorganize like that's kind                                  of where you know when you when you're                                  going to go and change a website and                                  make improvements to it certainly take                                  me into account your readers and your                                  audience is an important aspect of that                                  yeah I just wanted to get some                                  high-level advice from you guys so my                                  current site is for a law school and                                  half of its static content that semi                                  structured in Dreamweaver templates                                  where there's a title and a content and                                  a sidebar and then the other half of the                                  site is dynamic javaserver pages that's                                  actually coming out of a my sequel                                  database I was just curious for some                                  kind of high-level advice on a strategy                                  to deal with each side of the website so                                  there's obviously countless ways that                                  you could do it one way would be maybe                                  to do a migration of one set of content                                  into a format very similar to the other                                  so maybe export the data from sequel                                  server into a kind of structured format                                  or take the unstruck take the                                  semi-structured data and put it into my                                  sequel with you know with the other                                  content so that might be a way to help                                  you know right kind of one set of                                  migrations instead of two you know I                                  mean you could just also just have two                                  different sets of migration have you                                  know you have different people work on                                  them on the same people does that kind                                  of get close to the answering of your                                  question or                                  I think that really depends on who's                                  doing it some people are more                                  comfortable with like a command-line                                  tool and some people are more                                  comfortable with sequel scripts and then                                  if you have I think if you have like                                  some some Drupal talent using the magic                                  migrate module is probably a really good                                  way to do it and migrate you know you                                  can you can write different things to                                  get it into my grade so it can you know                                  my great can handle both the static                                  files you know or the database content I                                  sort of a technical question yeah it                                  going on what you're just saying with my                                  great module we had a recent migration                                  we went with feeds and the more I used                                  feeds the more I found that the use case                                  of feeds might not be directed for                                  migrations but more for other content                                  displaying and sharing yep I was                                  wondering what your recommendation is on                                  feeds and migrate and what the pros and                                  cons were I think in general migrate                                  provides a much better full end-to-end                                  process for getting data in because it                                  gives you you know you can intercept at                                  all at all points of the import you know                                  through the node saves and things like                                  that so you can you can have a more                                  robust migration wear something like                                  feeds is strictly like I have a few                                  different fields I just want to put them                                  in a few different fields you know I                                  have a few source fields I want to put                                  them in a few destination fields so just                                  a very basic mapping so I think in                                  general migrate is the best but it                                  really depends on on you know the                                  content and how much you have to do to                                  it to bring it into your system if you                                  don't have to do much and you don't have                                  much I think feeds can work really well                                  and be like a much simpler thing you                                  could you could even do it without                                  writing any code but if there's a lot of                                  translation and you know and and kind of                                  taking taking disparate pieces of data                                  and putting them together within the                                  same node then you're definitely going                                  to want to use something like my great                                  instead my great also gives you a lot of                                  like nice roll back features too right                                  yeah it lets you kind of play it rewind                                  it claims track of all the nodes                                  put in and kind of let you go in and see                                  how many made it and then you can wipe                                  them out and start over again yep and I                                  also want to thank Laura on our on our                                  design team for doing all the fun and so                                  thank you
