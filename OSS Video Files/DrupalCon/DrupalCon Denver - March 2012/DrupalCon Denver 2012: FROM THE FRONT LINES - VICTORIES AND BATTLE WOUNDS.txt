Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: FROM THE FRONT LINES - VICTORIES AND BATTLE WOUNDS
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	As anyone who designed, created, or managed a developer community knows, the process can be fraught with landmines, including issues with migrating existing social content to a new platform, integrating with disparate systems, and customizing the brand experience. In this panel discussion, we'll hear firsthand from eBay, LinkedIn, and Intel -- all of whom moved their community sites to Drupal, after initially building them on proprietary or DIY technologies -- on each company's unique experience and lessons they learned. Since, altogether, the developer communities for these companies account more than 1.5 Million developers worldwide, the impact of overhauling these communities was huge. The panelists will also discuss what other tools they were using prior to Drupal, why they decided to move to a new platform, and what they learned in the process. Panel speakers: Jeremy Johnston, Developer on developer.linkedin.com, LinkedIn Amy Piazza, Product Development for X.com / eBay Michael Shraver, Intel Web Administrator, Open Source Technology Center, Intel

Questions answered by this session: 
Why did these companies choose to move to Drupal when they already had an existing community website?
What metrics or evaluation methods did they employ before ultimately selecting Drupal?
How did they approach the migration process to Drupal?
What results have they seen, and did these results meet expectations?
If they had to do it all over again, what would they do differently?

for quite some time but                                as a developer and somebody who's                                actually been supporting in maintaining                                a drupal

contributor to PHP specifically                                especially during my yahoo days and                                before my                                yahoo days and I've developed a large                                number of websites some of the smaller                                websites have done for example is like                                hot scripts calm if any of you ever                                remember that site I was actually the                                developer who developed that it was                                running at the time and basically in a                                range of millions of page views per                                month all the way up to sites is a big                                as yahoo am address book which is doing                                at the time when we rewrote the entire                                website and did in PHP it was doing                                between                                                              per day at that time and all that was                                based on a PHP based website there I'm                                also the co-founder of an organization                                called random acts of kindness random                                acts of kindness is a basically a                                developer community where we bring                                people together to help solve some of                                the world's challenges specifically we                                started off in disaster response efforts                                but we've now branched out into doing an                                environmental impact and then just                                humanitarian aid projects in general and                                basically developing or organizing hack                                day events so that way people can come                                together and help build solutions for                                the NGOs and the other needy people of                                the world that don't necessarily always                                have the technical expertise to do that                                and incidentally also it is a Drupal                                based site as well so a little bit about                                how LinkedIn is actually using Drupal we                                actually use Drupal in a number of                                different capacities but my thing that I                                want to be talking about today from                                perspective is for our developer                                community so if you've ever been to                                 developer linkedin com you'll see that                                 this is our front page here of our site                                 standard Drupal deployment on Drupal                                   we actually leverage quite a few                                 different modules and different pieces                                 of the Drupal community so for example                                 here you see like a documentation page                                 from our documentation basically you can                                 see that we're using like the books                                 we're bringing in some of the content on                                 the side here we use vuze fairly heavily                                 we use a lot of different things we've                                 also developed some custom features and                                 modules for Drupal for example this code                                 highlighting section right here I looked                                 all around for trying to find something                                 that allowed us to be able to showcase                                 like code highlights that are in                                 multiple languages but they're all like                                 the same block of code couldn't really                                 find anything that addressed that need                                 so we actually developed something like                                 that and then open sourced it back to                                 the community which you can see them at                                 the bottom of that screenshot we also                                 make use of the advanced forms module we                                 have a very active community and with                                 tons of posts every day as you can see                                 here this was a screenshot from                                 yesterday                                 there's a extensive number of posts that                                 are happening on our forums and then                                 here's one example where you can see                                 where we're using the views in our                                 showcases that allow you to be able to                                 see I'm pulling different pieces of                                 content and make it easy for editors to                                 be able to update it but at the same                                 time being able to have a nice cohesive                                 look and feel to it hi there I'm Amy                                 Piazza I do manage development team at                                 ex commerce which is a new branch of                                 ebay inc focused on a commerce operating                                 system and our portal is XCOM so we it's                                 actually running on Drupal                                               migrated to Drupal                                                    software at the end of                                                 finished that project off and we've been                                 running since then on Drupal I have a                                 little bit of history with Drupal we                                 also brought it in house at AOL I ran                                 the developer network at AOL for a while                                 that ended with about                                                   and I think right now with XCOM word                                 about                                                             additional properties that we're looking                                 at I'm all about bringing Drupal to the                                 enterprise environment I know sometimes                                 that's good and sometimes it not so the                                 way we use Drupal on ExComm it's                                 essentially a developer Network we                                 represent the developer network in the                                 developer experience for ebay inc so all                                 of those properties that live under ebay                                 are at some point focused on ExComm that                                 includes paypal ebay itself x commerce                                 which is the new one magento marlo and                                 where right now we have other entities                                 like StubHub and rent com that will                                 eventually get there on the site we do                                 things you know standard developer                                 Network things like SDKs code samples                                 documentation sandbox environments all                                 of those lovely things and we also have                                 a developer directory which is a                                 partnership with our desk we have                                 certification programs for various                                 paypal api's and products                                 we've got a Riley writing articles for                                 us those are all featured on the site we                                 also have the standard forums blogs                                 support and evangelism or outreach we                                 did partner with Acquia but we currently                                 main town maintain everything in-house                                 so you know here's some concepts about                                 why developers around XCOM why they                                 matter to us it's an open system right                                 now and we're trying to kind of make our                                 mark in that environment we're working                                 on some common open standards in terms                                 of Commerce we rely pretty heavily on                                 developers to contribute back to the                                 system back to the environment and the                                 ecosystem and we're looking forward to                                 growing the whole site and in kind of                                 expanding the whole developer Network                                 so my name is Mike shaver and I work in                                 the open source technology Center at                                 Intel the albertsons Technology Center                                 has been around for a long time and it's                                 grown quite a bit but the primary focus                                 around around it has been Linux enabling                                 especially on them the Intel platforms                                 obviously so a little bit about me first                                 that I've been working with Drupal for                                 over six years before I got to the the                                 open source technology center and and                                 then been working with Drupal so silly                                 for our all of our sites at the open                                 source technology center as well so the                                 kind of projects that we that we are                                 involved in and at the group that I work                                 in it can range from everything from                                 contributing to the colonel to WebKit                                 smaller projects that we maintain like                                 con man and clutter yocto which is an                                 embedded project and then some larger                                 projects where we partner with other                                 larger companies like amigo and Tyson                                 and pretty much all of these except for                                 sums that are that are sort of like                                 we're just you know sort of contributing                                 to on the side need developer                                 communities the the range of size of                                 these are quite a bit we have a lot that                                 are very small and primarily function as                                 the external face of the project a place                                 where we have documentation and some                                 general information some downloads                                 usually around the project and then all                                 the way up to some larger projects that                                 that use a lot more that get a lot more                                 people involved in contributing in                                 certain ways we haven't used forums very                                 much in our projects that we tend to use                                 mailing lists for all the                                 collaboration around communication like                                 that but but just about everything else                                 that you can think of that a community                                 would need SDK downloads documentation                                 all that kind of stuff lives on these                                 sites we also for the vigo project ran                                 both of our large conference conferences                                 with the cod distribution and that was                                 very successful we were able to                                 customize it quite a bit and it was very                                 good and then we also use a open atrium                                 for some internal collaboration as well                                 so we use Drupal in a lot of different                                 ways comes in handy many places                                 excellent thank you for each providing                                 some context so now what we're going to                                 do is just do I have to waste with                                 questions that we're going to walk                                 through so I want to do that so if you                                 want you can tweet questions to using                                 the hashtag I'm following it up here                                 otherwise we'll have you come up to the                                 mic but i'll be happy to do it either                                 way so let's kick this off first the                                 first question i want to ask is each of                                 you is you know what were the factors                                 that led to your decision to select                                 drupal so you know each of yours are a                                 little bit different so when we talk a                                 little bit about how you came to that                                 decision so Amy you've done this at two                                 different organizations why don't you                                 take the lead can you hear me yep so we                                 did a pretty extensive analysis of                                 drupal and a variety of other enterprise                                 software pieces we did something called                                 a lamb analysis it's essentially a                                 qualitative and quantitative way to get                                 to a decision for technology we looked                                 at things like speed stability security                                 all of the functionality like community                                 management content management obviously                                 ease of administration collaborative                                 tools all of these sorts of things as                                 well as time to market how quickly could                                 we develop for this how quickly could we                                 make changes in iterations all of those                                 kind of came into the analysis and you                                 come up with a score and drupal one by                                 it's inhales Wow so it was pretty easy                                 so at LinkedIn the decision was actually                                 made before I joined for us to move over                                 to Drupal but a lot of the things that                                 went into that key decision-making                                 factor for us was basically number one                                 it being an open source product but yet                                 at the same time having a very vibrant                                 community that both as a volunteer basis                                 and then also with professional support                                 companies that are out there so if we                                 ran into issues we would be able to get                                 the support that we needed and both you                                 know for pay and not for patient's there                                 another thing that went into our                                 decision-making process was previously                                 the platform that we were on one of the                                 reasons why we chose that was because it                                 was a java-based product and so                                 subsequently because of the fact that                                 LinkedIn is a very job a heavy company                                 we thought that that would actually make                                 a lot of sense to stay on the same thing                                 well we since learned that those                                 requirements kind of changed and so we                                 were looking for something that                                 basically any ops person would be able                                 to easily come in and be able to support                                 and one of the benefits of a PHP based                                 solution is is that basically almost                                 every ops person out there can go and                                 manage a PHP stack and be able to                                 understand how to set up apache                                 understand how to set up PHP and get                                 things going and then also another                                 factor that played into our decision was                                 being able to find all the different                                 features that we needed and then but yet                                 if we couldn't find a specific feature                                 having a very extensive developer coke                                 system and modulation system so that way                                 we could go in and do the things we                                 needed to do custom but yet do it very                                 easily cool um well Intel's will you                                 know quite large and in our group is                                 just a part of that but being the                                 open-source technology center it was                                 obvious that we need to find an open                                 source solution most of Intel uses                                 Microsoft for most of their product                                 stuff and websites so but it just was                                 clearly the winner from our perspective                                 from the customization and the community                                 perspective so talk a little bit intel                                 given that it is such a microsoft heavy                                 shop i mean obviously in your group                                 because you're open source i mean do you                                 have pressures from other parts of the                                 organization about open source                                 conceptually or i mean intel has a long                                 history of                                 I mean we're one of the largest and                                 second largest contributor to the                                 colonel and to other projects as well                                 but yeah it sometimes can be challenging                                 just because the ite group can be                                 entrenched but but you know I think they                                 give us wide latitude cool so let's talk                                 about the learning process for the                                 development teams I mean you know you                                 talked to Jeremy that us you guys are a                                 job of a shop so as when you made that                                 switch where there was you or the people                                 other people within LinkedIn you know                                 what was that process like what you go                                 through from train you know from a                                 training perspective how much of a                                 change was it so in the case of that                                 basically our developer relations team                                 which I'm part of his one who actually                                 maintains the Drupal site there so it                                 necessarily wasn't necessarily an issue                                 with moving Java developers over to that                                 but at the same time there were being                                 like I'm one of the primary people that                                 actually supports and develops for the                                 pool site being a long time PHP user I                                 was very set in my ways of how I did                                 things in PHP and so subsequently when                                 you're coming in to a system like drupal                                 sometimes things can be a little bit                                 harder I'm initially just because of the                                 fact that you have a set way of doing                                 things and so subsequently because of                                 that there's a bit of a learning curve                                 and whereas if you're coming in fresh                                 and not necessarily being having set                                 processes for how you did stuff in the                                 past you can have much easier time and                                 the way I liken that to what I'm talking                                 to some of my developer friends is that                                 Drupal in a way is kind of like the                                 rails so to speak of the PHP CMS                                 community and that there's a right way                                 to do just about every task it's usually                                 well documented but finding out what                                 that one right way to do that task so                                 can sometimes be a bit of a hurdle the                                 other thing that I would say is that a                                 lot of the documentation that's out                                 there and a lot of the tutorials and                                 hands-on guides and things like this                                 were written from Drupal                                                probably the landmark success so far to                                 speak of the Drupal community and so                                 there was a whole bunch of content                                 written about it drupal                                            enough difference where you kind of have                                 to make sure that you're you're                                 the documentation that you're reading or                                 the tutorials that you're looking at                                 you're actually making sure that you're                                 still following best practice and so a                                 lot of the things have not necessarily                                 been updated so you just got to be                                 careful and cognizant of that and then                                 furthermore I would say as with any open                                 source product you can't pump that                                 responsibility of making sure that                                 things are secure things are done the                                 right way and stuff like this um when                                 you're using a third-party modules you                                 got to make sure that you're looking                                 over that and taking ownership and                                 responsibility for making sure that what                                 you're deploying is actually the stable                                 and quality nature excellent I know Amy                                 you you talked a little bit about how                                 you had a mix of both Drupal and non                                 Drupal developers I mean how is this                                 impacted your organization on the                                 development side I think there's a                                 little bit of learning curve whenever                                 there's a new technology right you know                                 we went with documentation we actually                                 use Drupal eyes me for some training I                                 think the the ramp up and everything                                 like that was probably shorter than some                                 other enterprise stuff um I think it's                                 been pretty good they're actually here                                 they can probably tell you more about it                                 hahaha excellent so what talk about                                 migrations I know at least but Jeremy                                 for you and Amy for you migrations was                                 you guys moved over from a proprietary                                 systems you know from a developer                                 community you know social content                                 perspective what was that process like                                 what was you know was some of the                                 lessons learned or you know things you                                 could share around that maybe you wanna                                 go first so we actually had a pretty                                 complex migration we actually had a                                 three to four part migration one was we                                 actually two from a jive system two                                 different job systems different versions                                 one from a homegrown CMS and then the                                 last one was from an internal paypal                                 system so we had a wide variety of data                                 structures data types to move and kind                                 of get everything together along with                                 users you know we we it kind of morphed                                 along the way and some of the challenges                                 that we faced were you know creating a                                 common framework and getting all of that                                 lined up                                 and having the foresight to understand                                 what was coming at us again so that we                                 could adjust and adapt Jeremy want to                                 talk about your experience so the CMS                                 system that we were coming from that was                                 java-based was it something called jive                                 so if any of you have heard about that                                 that's what we were using some of the                                 challenges that we ran into was number                                 one was getting the content out of jive                                 they actually have a fairly extensive                                 API system but pulling out some of the                                 content was not necessarily the easiest                                 thing to do we thankfully were able to                                 use a xml output format that they had                                 and then using the one of the Drupal                                 modules for import we were able to pull                                 in like content syndication and pull it                                 in through that mechanism but one of the                                 things that we learned kind of along the                                 process of testing things was was that                                 the import export process isn't perfect                                 and one of the things especially that                                 you'll run into is that especially in                                 the case of what jive jive went in and                                 added a lot of custom markup and thin                                 like specific CSS style tags and things                                 like this on a lot of the content so                                 when that gets imported into Drupal side                                 if you just do a straight import                                 straight across you're not necessarily                                 you're gonna have extra markup and your                                 documents that your pages that is not                                 necessarily relevant or needed anymore                                 and so subsequently things may render                                 just a little bit off or things may have                                 a bloated markup so you're going to have                                 to go in and hand finessed a lot of that                                 content so be prepared for that one of                                 the other things that we learned                                 especially the hard way to is no matter                                 how many times you went in and tested                                 your import process test it two more                                 times we ran into a couple issues where                                 like we thought we had everything                                 absolutely perfect and then we go on the                                 day of the actual migrations we were                                 scrambling and have to go in and make a                                 couple fixes so just be prepared that no                                 matter how many times you think you ran                                 over it you probably haven't ran enough                                 time so your process interesting now                                 what about training for content                                 contributors the people that use these                                 sites that you know and they're                                 participating whether it's you know                                 interacting in the forms in some cases                                 or you know providing information up                                 there what sort of things did you have                                 to do in that side Michael do you want                                 to take that one it's been a pretty easy                                 transition for most people not everyone                                 but                                 you know general the content you know                                 forums and stuff are pretty                                 straightforward and you know I think it                                 sometimes is difficult for people that                                 are used to working in documents you                                 know and that that's kind of a you know                                 a jump for a few people but in general                                 people make the transition pretty easily                                 so I mean we don't do we don't do a lot                                 of training specifically except for you                                 know just getting the the sites out                                 there in front of people and line them                                 to use it that's usually enough yeah I                                 mean one of the things that we hear I                                 know along the lines when people are                                 evaluating Drupal for these types of                                 applications is you know it they see the                                 sexy demo from a jive or they see you                                 know something in the you know like Oh                                 would you pull you know we always hear                                 about the authoring experience in that                                 so have you had any pushback from the                                 authors the people that use it on a                                 daily basis or regular basis do you have                                 people there in it every day yeah I mean                                 the people that are there in it every                                 day get more used to it I think you know                                 it could be better and even you know                                 some of the stuff that's happening here                                 at the conference and then coming you                                 know leading up to the conference about                                 the content creation form improvements                                 and stuff are all going to help so I                                 think you know in general it's the great                                 thing about Drupal is that it's it's                                 moving fast and so it'll want to get                                 better I think but we don't really have                                 a lot of issues with it currently even                                 okay Jeremy are doing add to it I guess                                 one of the things that I would add to                                 that is is that it kind of really speaks                                 to the power and the awesomeness of                                 Drupal in a way that in our case even                                 our marketing and PR people and others                                 who have dug in now mind you a lot of                                 those are at least they do have a                                 technical slant but not a single one of                                 them it's had to have any specialized                                 training all of them have been able to                                 go in and write content and immediately                                 dig right in and do things on your                                 second kind of question that you posed                                 to Mike that would be one area that I                                 feel like we may have lost a little bit                                 but it hasn't been a pain point when in                                 jive jive aksha has a really nice                                 feature that allows you to when your                                 like for example you're posting a                                 comment or you're updating a                                 documentation page it's very easy to go                                 and find a related content to be able to                                 link to that directly from inside there                                                                                                      that I'm sure there's probably a drupal                                 module and I just haven't went and found                                 it yet but at the same time out of the                                 box jive did a little bit better but in                                 general I would say that you know it's                                 extremely easy to get going with Drupal                                 and we've had zero pain points from any                                 of our content authors and it's                                 interesting I was at a conference a few                                 weeks ago and it was a CMS conference                                 but they're like oh you know we come in                                 one of the other vendors we come in and                                 we'll train you on what you should be                                 using a CMS for then we'll do training                                 walk you through requirement gathering                                 and then we'll build it for you and then                                 we'll do training on how to use it I was                                 like wait a minute this is all the                                 training at what I can i use it i use if                                 I can use this I want to be able to use                                 your CMS the expectations have shifted                                 so much for content contributors it's a                                 you know it's interesting i just don't                                 think people have much patience for that                                 level of training just to use than                                 application you know use a system you                                 know the this also ties into maybe a                                 segue into mobile how do you guys think                                 about mobile for your developer                                 communities both for you know for people                                 that are contributing content or you                                 know the people that are using an act                                 interacting on the on the communities                                 I'm Michael do you n take the lead on it                                 it hasn't been the highest priority for                                 certainly for our sites but it's                                 certainly becoming you know greater                                 importance for us and I think it's just                                 a matter of being able to develop it in                                 a way that that allows for mobile you                                 know interaction and it's pretty easy to                                 do in Drupal in general I mean it's                                 mainly on the design side that you                                 really have to consider I mean there's                                 some improvements I think going into the                                 administration side but I'm not so sure                                 that too many administrators are going                                 to be administrating your site on a                                 mobile device I think it's more on the                                 you know content creation and the                                 viewings I that it that it's working out                                 well I know one of the things that you                                 mentioned we talked was a you know some                                 of the for your mobile developer                                 communities they're actually you know                                 wanted get access to the to their                                 reference documentation and yeah on the                                 device while they're debugging and are                                 working building a so some of the some                                 of the newer projects that were working                                 on                                 Oh s you know systems and so you're                                 going to have developers are going to be                                 kind of testing on live devices and are                                 going to want to maybe jump over to see                                 documentation really quickly so that                                 will be nice I think as well nice Amy do                                 you want to talk about sort of what you                                 guys are doing an expo we're kinda in                                 the same boat where it hasn't been the                                 top priority I think it's becoming table                                 stakes now so it's something that we                                 definitely have to address my plan is to                                 simply address it with the responsive                                 design and take it from that approach                                 interesting anything Jeremy went on so I                                 guess the point that I would add to that                                 is that I kind of want to separate two                                 facets of the discussion here so number                                 one mobile is extremely important to                                 LinkedIn as a company and it's also                                 extremely important to our developer                                 community so having mobile am access to                                 our API is in our platform and SDKs is                                 something that's very important but at                                 the same time I would say that accessing                                 our website our developer website                                 specifically on a mobile device itself                                 hasn't necessarily been a high priority                                 and a lot of that has to do with the                                 fact that the people who are coming to                                 our website based off of all of the                                 analytics that we've done they're                                 sitting at their desk top computer in                                 their coding so when you're sitting                                 coding you're going to have a web                                 browser available to you and                                 subsequently you're gonna be able to                                 pull up in that web browser and look at                                 the documentation interact in the forums                                 and things like this so while our                                 website does work on mobile devices                                 specifically like an iPad it's                                 absolutely great experience it doesn't                                 necessarily translate as well down to an                                 iphone type or smaller screen sizes and                                 so subsequently it's not been a priority                                 for us just because of the fact that                                 most people you can't code from your                                 iPhone so well I guess you could but                                 most people don't and so subsequently                                 because you're not doing that and it's                                 not been our primary focus okay cool so                                 let's stick with You Jeremy and talk                                 about you know real life best practices                                 when implementing Drupal you know the                                 pitfalls or things to avoid you know                                 there's one thing that you know now that                                 you wish you knew when you started off                                 this effort you know what would that be                                 I guess one of the things that I would                                 say is is that be very careful when                                 you're using third-party modules a lot                                 there's a lot of really good modules out                                 there but there's also a lot of really                                 bad modules at the same time and                                 popularity does not necessarily equate                                 to a module being                                 specific quality or not and one of the                                 things that I think part of the reason                                 for that is is that the Drupal community                                 makes it extremely easy for somebody to                                 contribute a module to the to the                                 community and so subsequently because                                 there's almost zero barrier to entry                                 there's gonna be a wide range of                                 different things that are published out                                 there and some of them are well                                 maintained some of them or not and one                                 of the things that I do want to applaud                                 the Drupal community on is that unlike                                 other communities for example WordPress                                 where they kind of hide you know some of                                 the issues they hide this and they hide                                 that from what's going on Drupal makes                                 it very obvious on the front page you                                 can see when the last commit happened on                                 that you can see how many bug reports                                 there are and things like this so it's                                 very easy to identify like what are the                                 better modules in that respect to the                                 modules that I specifically wanted to                                 kind of spot lighten that we had lessons                                 learned on was that the comment notify                                 plugin it's a great plugin and allows                                 people to be able to go in and be able                                 to subscribe to comments that are posted                                 so in the case is like a temp forums                                 module if you wanted to know when                                 somebody else is replying you could                                 subsequently subscribe the issue that we                                 ran into that module is is that it was                                 very specifically designed in such a way                                 that it didn't actually make as much                                 sense so if you subscribed on one post                                 on the thread you probably didn't you                                 posted again you probably don't want to                                 subscribe again see we get duplicate                                 emails well because of that that was                                 because the way the module is                                 architected every time you post in that                                 thread you could be resubscribe and get                                 multiple emails so that was a concern                                 that we had to go in and do another one                                 was a CD in module the CDN module for                                 Drupal                                                                  and modules all stopped their                                 development and they all pushed                                 everybody towards the one that's called                                 CDN unfortunately due to a bug that was                                 in the CDN module you had to go in like                                 you couldn't actually use this in Drupal                                                                                                        colon slash slash URLs and so                                 subsequently it didn't work furthermore                                 if you have we're on an H if you fix                                 that problem in the code which I do want                                 to take time to know that there is the                                 bug tracking system is an excellent                                 resource so make sure that any of the                                 models that you're using review the bug                                 tracking system because there's tons of                                 almost every issue that we haven't found                                 somebody else had already posted and in                                 most cases it had already posted a patch                                 to fix it in the bug system whether it                                 have been rolled back into the                                 bass or not so that's an excellent                                 resource for you but in the case of this                                 once you fix that problem then if you're                                 an HTTPS site there was another bug in                                 the module where it didn't work for                                 HTTPS and the interesting thing about                                 this module is it was extremely                                 feature-rich it had pretty much                                 everything you could ever want in a CD                                 in module and subsequently there's about                                 three thousand lines of code well when I                                 went into this build it down to find                                 exactly what we needed the em out of                                 that whole module is nine lines of code                                 so in this case here you know we decided                                 you know instead of running into these                                 perpetual issues a module that hadn't                                 been well maintained over the last year                                 we just took the nine lines of code that                                 we needed that were relevant and made                                 our own module and then subsequently use                                 that so be prepared and aware that that                                 might be a step that you need to do                                 furthermore I would kind of say that be                                 like I already kind of touched on this                                 but be cognizant of the fact that just                                 because you're using open source you                                 still have to take ownership for making                                 sure that like security you're staying                                 up to date and things like this the                                 Drupal community is really good about                                 publicizing when there's a security                                 fixes and like making sure that you're                                 aware of it but you need to dedicate                                 time to making sure that you do stay                                 up-to-date and make sure that you're                                 staying on top of those the general rule                                 of thumb that I always like to use is                                 plan on using about an hour a week to                                 maintaining and keeping your site live                                 and that doesn't mean that you have to                                 do an hour's worth of work but making                                 sure that you're staying current on                                 what's going on in the community knowing                                 where the community is going and is a                                 great it is going to set you up for                                 success in the long run especially like                                 paying attention to even though Drupal                                   isn't released and out there in the                                 field yet for production use making sure                                 that you know where drupal                                             making sure that that aligns with that                                 with your goals and your initiatives                                 because otherwise it could catch you off                                 guard and subsequently you left you know                                 after maintain and support that so Amy                                 why don't you go next and talk a little                                 bit about you know what you wish you                                 knew back then when you started oh he's                                 probably a ton of stuff that you know                                 that falls into that category you know I                                 think as we rolled out our project                                 there's plenty of things that have come                                 up and I think we're still uncovering a                                 lot of stuff                                 you know I think taking ownership of the                                 modules that you install is a good thing                                 we definitely do some vetting behind the                                 modules before you roll them out bug                                 trackers awesome just you know take a                                 look around and make sure everything's                                 good and solid before you go forward                                 with it Michael doin anything one of the                                 things that we you know learned over the                                 over the course of the years is that you                                 know a lot of our we have a lot of sites                                 and a lot of the stuff is pretty                                 repeatable and so we're really you know                                 driving towards the distribution kind of                                 model and kind of that that features or                                 apps where we can reuse them so we                                 generalize them sometimes add some                                 settings so that they can be customized                                 for a site but are basically the same                                 code base and that's been really useful                                 because that way you know it just                                 shortens our development time                                 considerably for an individual site                                 excellent talk about change management                                 you know our team structures for                                 successfully implementing Drupal you                                 know you talked a little bit about your                                 guys going to the solution roof I know                                 this you had some some pretty strong                                 opinions here maybe want you to kick us                                 off Amy so XCOM is kind of in a tricky                                 situation from a corporate website                                 perspective we have a ton of                                 stakeholders pretty much anybody and                                 everybody in the company has a stake in                                 this site all the products go out every                                 you know we're in the go-to-market plan                                 for everybody and as we were rolling out                                 Drupal and as we were redesigning this                                 site and redeploying it we we                                 restructured the team considerably we                                 had a large enterprise Java based team                                 overseas offshore we restructured the                                 team into a much smaller team onshore                                 all based in San Jose with a mixture of                                 skills and you know we really kind of                                 spread out the skills so that we had                                 people who were really good at CSS and                                 had people who are drupal experts and                                 had people who were learning and I think                                 the structure is working out really well                                 now their son Jeremy anything you want                                 to add so um one of the things that I                                 think that this made us extremely                                 successful I'm in this area so far is we                                 spent a lot of time when we were                                 initially doing the drupal deployment to                                 go in and set up a lot of the groundwork                                 in infrastructure pieces ahead of time                                 and that was one of the things that made                                 it very easy for us to roll out new                                 changes and things like this some of                                 those entailed for example I get based                                 deployment process that allows us to be                                 able to roll out new fixes into the                                 field other things were automated                                 backups so for example every besides                                 just the nightly backups that everybody                                 naturally normal already runs we also                                 made it to where like for example every                                 time we did a new deployment to the site                                 it would automatically back up the                                 entire code base as well as a database                                 so that way even if you'd forgot or                                 something like this and that also                                 facilitates easy roll back so that way                                 what after an assay for example                                 something push out in the field and                                 there's something wrong we could run one                                 command from the shell and be able to                                 roll back to the exact state where it                                 was even if there had been migrations or                                 other things that had happened to update                                 the database and then finally was making                                 sure that you had a consistent approach                                 to being able to bringing site up and                                 down basically if you are just depending                                 on the maintenance page well when you're                                 pushing code you can't depend on the                                 fact that the maintenance page is                                 actually going to be live so we                                 configured on a load balancers a way to                                 be able to when we're doing it a push                                 deployment process that it doesn't that                                 none of the traffic even hits to the web                                 servers at all and it says that the site                                 is a maintenance and that we're actually                                 doing that push process thanks Alan                                 excellent let's talk about roadblocks                                 you know what do you do when Drupal                                 doesn't meet your needs your community                                 you know developer communities usually                                 have a lot of different pieces of it                                 wiki's or something we talked about some                                 of those others you know what do you do                                 when you hit that you hit one of those                                 roadblocks Michael do you want to start                                 yeah that you know a lot of the                                 developers in our group have worked with                                 other tools and so Drupal wasn't always                                 the best answer in the case of you know                                 a site that has a lot of developers and                                 needs good wiki we usually go with                                 mediawiki just just because of the way                                 that that they're used to working and                                 ease of that application for or wiki                                 content and we found that with some                                 other applications as well so it really                                 comes down to you know is there a tool                                 that that that that is good enough to                                 use and then if not then we can look at                                 Drupal and if it doesn't exist in Drupal                                 then we can build it so it kind of goes                                 down that line usually we start with you                                 know does does the functionality exists                                 in Drupal and can we can we leverage                                 that to begin with and if not then then                                 we look Val Sorenson so do you wanna go                                 to Jeremy so I would probably echo the                                 same things that might just said but I'm                                 an additional Emma so what we kind of                                 ran into issues wasn't necessarily on                                 the wiki side of things but is in our                                 forums so we have a very vibrant                                 community that's posting a lot of posts                                 and they're asking a lot of specific                                 questions and stuff like this and                                 because we segregate out our forms based                                 off of different perspective parts of                                 our API so in our case for example our                                 rest forms are separate from our plugins                                 forums and so subsequently as you                                 probably will know in any form people                                 post on the wrong in the wrong forums                                 they post on existing threads and things                                 like this and so one of the pain points                                 that we've kind of ran into is is that                                 the forums while it's a pretty good and                                 it has a good solid foundation it's not                                 the same thing as a full-featured like                                 forum package like for example if you've                                  ever used vbulletin or things like this                                  of the administration capabilities and                                  things like this are a little bit                                  lacking I would say that it hasn't                                  necessarily been a roadblock for us but                                  it's kind of some one of the things                                  where we wish it was better and so                                  subsequently like Mike said it's one of                                  those areas where we're going to                                  probably invest some time and effort in                                  going in and like enhancing advanced                                  forms and making like super enhanced our                                  advanced forms to be able to better                                  support some of those administration                                  features that we're looking for thanks                                  Alan Amy do you want to talk about a few                                  things sure I mean I think we take the                                  same approach you know check it out see                                  if it's out there if we can leverage                                  what's there if not build it one of the                                  things that we're tracking right now is                                  technical documentation or having a                                  really kind of difficult time combining                                  all of these different formats of                                  technical documentation into something                                  that's reasonably presentable                                  site and we don't exactly have a                                  solution yet we're kind of exploring our                                  options right now so okay you know if                                  you if just a reminder if you do want to                                  submit a question via Twitter you can                                  all open we'll move to some of those as                                  well here there's a question actually                                  they came in from dan Amy you mentioned                                  the lamb and analysis when you did your                                  sort of selection process can you talk a                                  little bit more about what that is                                  explained it maybe provide our                                  references that other people might be                                  able to use that framework sure it's                                  it's actually if you do a search for                                  word it's um l with                                                      actually created by one of our chief                                  architects jeremy carry a it's actually                                  pretty easy way to make a technology to                                  decision you you essentially you define                                  what good is and you have a quality tree                                  so you kind of define all of those                                  things that you're looking for and a                                  good product and then there's a whole                                  formulation that goes with it where you                                  give ratings and values to each of those                                  qualities and you end up with a score                                  and it's a really easy way to actually                                  come to a conclusion in a quick way                                  interesting what about commons drupal                                  commons is a distribution for community                                  sites did anyone look at commons                                  evaluate that sort of what role did that                                  play in your process under jeremy do you                                  want to talk or does anybody have it                                  okay we actually did start by looking at                                  commons and by the time we got through                                  all of the things that we actually                                  needed we realized that it was the                                  Drupal                                                                sense where we going to use enough of                                  Commons to stay off of                                                didn't match up so we ended up with                                  essentially a partial commons on Drupal                                                                                                          but not all um anybody well happy to                                  take questions from the audience if you                                  guys want to come to the mic of all                                  right hey thanks I'm Ryan work on                                  opening i dot org and we're an energy                                  sharing platform that's considering                                  building a community and developer                                  community is a big place we'd like to                                  start we have a lot of a pis and                                  things like that so I'm wondering how do                                  you incentivize building a community so                                  I think like for a linkedin well the                                  developers there are really interested                                  in building something for LinkedIn I                                  imagine but for an energy information                                  platform how do you get how do you draw                                  those developers how do you keep them                                  there how do you say this is the best                                  place to be for finding energy data sets                                  around the world and use our API etc etc                                  so how do you drive community                                  participation you know build it and they                                  will come right so as you pointed out                                  you know people already know about                                  LinkedIn so they're coming there and                                  they're actually wanting specifically to                                  integrate with the LinkedIn platform so                                  that part of that is already been hurdle                                  has been a little bit overcome i would                                  say that one of the biggest things is                                  making sure that people feel a part of                                  the community and making them feel like                                  they are being able to contribute back                                  so i know personally from the                                  communities that i've been involved in                                  prior to working at linkedin                                  specifically especially before i joined                                  yahoo was the communities that i took                                  part in was the ones that i actually                                  felt like I had a contribution and I                                  could do something there so whether that                                  was maybe helping improve the                                  documentation maybe that was going in                                  and smelling code samples or tutorials                                  maybe that was answering questions in a                                  forums so making sure that there's a                                  venir I can feel like like I'm doing                                  some kind of impact and then also                                  getting recognition for the impact that                                  I am having so if you can figure out                                  ways to be able to spotlight members of                                  the community that are they are doing a                                  lot I think that you're going to be a                                  lot more successful in that regard then                                  as far as driving traffic I mean it's a                                  standard process you would to drive                                  traffic towards you know any of the                                  sites if making sure that people know                                  about you and that's going to be                                  relevant to you know every site is going                                  to have a different mechanism for doing                                  that but the general broad goals is just                                  making sure that you're out there                                  talking about it and making sure that                                  you know other people who are writing                                  content thats related to your site                                  making sure that they know about it and                                  then linking to it                                  I mean I think a lot of it is just the                                  ease and the findability of information                                  and is it easy to post in content is                                  there a lot of hurdles that they have to                                  jump through and all that stuff I think                                  contributes quite a bit to the                                  participation rate I mean I think there                                  are other there are other ways as well                                  but I think those are the pretty cute                                  curious anyone having um I think                                  engagement is something that all of us                                  can are challenged with at any given                                  time you know we we actually are                                  spending a lot of time on reputation                                  building and being able to showcase                                  people on how their contributions are                                  affecting the community and in a very                                  visual sort of way and I think that I                                  think it remains to be proven but I                                  think it's a good step in the right                                  direction anybody else have any                                  questions that they want to ask at the                                  mic all right hi I'm Ben I work at cgi                                  in canada i managed to drupal team where                                  we build large-scale infrastructure for                                  banks and things like that and one of                                  the bigger challenges well for nav is                                  everything around deployment whether                                  it's content staging where it's                                  deploying new sites whether it's the                                  general deployment mechanisms is always                                  a more or less a custom solution for                                  each client and I was wondering how you                                  guys generally under that do you do                                  content staging have you looked into the                                  eager project for example it for helping                                  rolling out sides faster or can you talk                                  a bit about your strategy around that so                                  as you mentioned I think it is going to                                  be very specific to the type of                                  environment that you're working in so in                                  our case all of our infrastructure at                                  the moment at least is hosted on joint                                  smart machines that's something we're to                                  probably bring back in-house and be                                  doing on our own infrastructure but so a                                  lot of the process around that was very                                  specific to like how we were set up in                                  our environment I would say that you                                  know we definitely do have a staging                                  environment we also have developer                                  environments so one of the things that I                                  set up was going in and using something                                  called vagrant which allows you to                                  quickly set up a developer environment                                  that's reproducible and so because we                                  had the backups                                  that we're automatically being done you                                  know every time we did a co deployment                                  it made it very easy to just be able to                                  go in and grab one of those tar balls                                  and then use that to build the developer                                  environment so that we had exactly what                                  was in the production environment for                                  your testing i would say that there is a                                  number of different projects that are                                  out there in different stages of                                  maturity that kind of make that process                                  a little bit easier and then but we just                                  it didn't necessarily fit our specific                                  needs one thing that I do want to kind                                  of plug here on the aqua aside aqua does                                  have a solution where that we were                                  interested in but didn't necessarily                                  work for us was being able to have like                                  development staging and production                                  environments and then being able to                                  easily like one button push my great                                  stuff that had happened in your                                  development environment to the staging                                  and then up to the production                                  environment and it sounds extremely                                  interesting and i would love to explore                                  that a little bit more but it just                                  didn't fit linkedin specific needs                                  anybody else won't have anything else                                  they want to add yeah I think I would                                  echo that as well and it's it can be                                  difficult and there it usually does come                                  down to some kind of a custom solution                                  but I do think that some of the hosted                                  solutions like the Aqua and Pantheon                                  have some interesting concepts around                                  them and may may work for your needs it                                  didn't work exactly for our needs                                  because of the requirements of so many                                  other services attached to these sites                                  and so that became a little bit                                  difficult someday that might get it                                  solved but good okay so I'm wondering                                  what's the best way to support a                                  hackathon and to build your development                                  community from going to hack events                                  helping people get data API etc from                                  those events do any thoughts on that so                                  I don't have a direct response from that                                  from a linkedin perspective but based on                                  my background with random acts of                                  kindness I can give a lot of insight                                  there so basically random acts of                                  kindness is about a developing hack day                                  events and then one of the challenges                                  that we've had with random acts of                                  kindness is bringing that continuity                                  between events and so that way just                                  because you're at a                                                    stop there there's still ongoing things                                  that go on especially because our nature                                  of the hacks that we're doing with                                  random acts of kindness is trying to                                  build sustainable solutions for disaster                                  response and environmental impacts in                                  other areas so basically you can't just                                  stop at that point and so that's why we                                  in the case of ram with rock we are                                  leaning on drupal and being able to                                  build out the draggable community where                                  people can interact and be able to stay                                  up to date on what those specific hacks                                  are so again it's kind of is very much                                  intended by your specific audience but                                  in our case there it was being able make                                  sure that all the projects that were                                  worked on are being spotlighted up on                                  the website that there is a way for                                  people to be able to find out who was                                  working on these projects find out what                                  the current status of those projects are                                  and then also being able to like get                                  involved and contribute back                                  specifically that was all things that                                  were there been a very successful for                                  block okay so I work for jaspersoft and                                  we are currently in the middle of a                                  migration of our community site Jasper                                  forg and one of the things that has come                                  up and we're still undecided about is                                  user points or user karma thinking about                                  either going with and model like stack                                  exchange or stack overflow or I was just                                  wondering if any of you had experience                                  or thoughts around user karma or user                                  points a mean you talked a little bit                                  about that right yeah we're actually in                                  a partnership with badge ville to create                                  a whole framework for that you know it's                                  there's a bunch of facets to that it's                                  User points there's user badges there's                                  profiles there's levels expertise all of                                  those things that all kind of roll into                                  you know I'll karma or whatever your you                                  want to call it it's kind of a cool                                  thing I think I said earlier I think it                                  remains to be proven for us in                                  particular I think it's proven elsewhere                                  you don't think of it but that little                                  badge next to your name is pretty                                  powerful when you get those and you kind                                  of kind of sinks into your mentality and                                  you start working towards things more                                  often I know just even intuitively when                                  i use forums                                  support forms or whatever those are the                                  kinds of things I'm looking for before I                                  go read the answers you know I know                                  symantec has a customer support                                  community built in Drupal called connect                                  and that's a big piece of that                                  experience I don't know do you guys                                  anybody else have anything they want to                                  add on this side I would say that it's                                  something that we agree is very                                  important it's something we're                                  investigating at LinkedIn so in our case                                  you know for example with a profile that                                  you had mentioned there and we pull in                                  through a single sign-on solution we                                  pull in all of the existing linkedin                                  profile but one of the things that i                                  think would be a very interesting is not                                  only having the badging specifically on                                  the LinkedIn developer website so when                                  you're seeing some it in the forums you                                  can see like what the reputation score                                  is and how good a quality responses the                                  community things that they have or how                                  many responses in general that they made                                  but then also being able to have that                                  badging show up potentially on linkedin                                  com so whenever somebody's viewing your                                  public profile they can see oh this is a                                  is it active developer in our community                                  so it's things that we're exploring but                                  right now we just don't have a                                  established solution in place for ya                                  we've looked into it with a couple of                                  our projects as well but we never really                                  have gone down that road so maybe                                  someday but it gets complicated I think                                  that's the thing it's there's a lot of                                  data points and the value of those data                                  points is different in its kind of                                  subjective a little bit so you have to                                  be kind of careful good thanks for                                  letting me know monopolize questions                                  here have a lot of good error I have a                                  lot of questions for you guys so all                                  right aqua Commons I think of kind of as                                  a as a huge vacuous warehouse when you                                  first install it there's like                                     different features at least you know                                  forums blogs whatever you know how do                                  you start that with the community                                  without them feeling like they're in                                  this universe that has three people in                                  it what like what tools do you start                                  with first do you start with forums to                                  start blogs do you get give the                                  community everything and just say have                                  fun and see what happens do you build up                                  through organic groups what are some                                  strategies around that                                  just in general like you know how much                                  how much how BIG's the menu when you                                  first started right yeah we usually                                  start pretty pretty modestly you know                                  with blogs and stuff just because and                                  then build that over time and but it                                  usually it's it's it's it's some social                                  interaction stuff like blogs and then                                  it's a lot of content and I think the                                  content starts to drive people and then                                  you add additional functionality over                                  time but yeah I you don't want to                                  necessarily launch with an empty say I                                  guess I would echo those same points is                                  is that you need to make sure you have                                  enough content to keep the people                                  interested in coming back I mean you                                  also don't overwhelm them with a lot of                                  different places that they need to go to                                  until you have that established                                  community so I would say like focus on                                  you know whether you're going to do the                                  blog focus on maybe you're going to have                                  like static content things like this and                                  then also in the forums if you can go in                                  and get like a closed community like for                                  example I'm like you're a media peer                                  group or something like this to go and                                  start discussions so that way whenever                                  you do officially launch then you don't                                  see like a completely dead forums I know                                  that from a lot of the communities that                                  I've been involved in the past if the                                  complete the site is completely barren                                  and there's no activity on it at all                                  it's going to be a lot less likely that                                  i'm going to come back and check those                                  forums because it's just i don't                                  necessarily see that content so trying                                  to get some of that initial i'm content                                  there is going to be very helpful to i                                  think yeah you definitely want to cede                                  stuff you know something as simple as an                                  faq is often helpful to someone who's                                  new and exploring a new product or new                                  offering you know an empty side is never                                  a good thing cool well I think we're at                                  a time here so I want to thank
