Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: FROM THE FRONT LINES - VICTORIES AND BATTLE WOUNDS
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	As anyone who designed, created, or managed a developer community knows, the process can be fraught with landmines, including issues with migrating existing social content to a new platform, integrating with disparate systems, and customizing the brand experience. In this panel discussion, we'll hear firsthand from eBay, LinkedIn, and Intel -- all of whom moved their community sites to Drupal, after initially building them on proprietary or DIY technologies -- on each company's unique experience and lessons they learned. Since, altogether, the developer communities for these companies account more than 1.5 Million developers worldwide, the impact of overhauling these communities was huge. The panelists will also discuss what other tools they were using prior to Drupal, why they decided to move to a new platform, and what they learned in the process. Panel speakers: Jeremy Johnston, Developer on developer.linkedin.com, LinkedIn Amy Piazza, Product Development for X.com / eBay Michael Shraver, Intel Web Administrator, Open Source Technology Center, Intel
