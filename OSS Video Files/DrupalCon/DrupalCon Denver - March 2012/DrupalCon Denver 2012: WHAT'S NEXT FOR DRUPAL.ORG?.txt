Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: WHAT'S NEXT FOR DRUPAL.ORG?
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	Depending on how far the Drupal Association gets with its 2012 plan, this will either be a report on what's going to happen for 2012 for Drupal.org, or a brainstorming session to try and prioritize a list of said things, or quite possibly both! I'll also report on major Drupal.org development successes we've had in the last year, and how YOU (yes, you!) can get involved in making our home more awesome!
