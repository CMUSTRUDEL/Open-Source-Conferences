Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: CREATING RESPONSIVE AND MOBILE-FIRST DRUPAL THEMES
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	Responsive Web Design is all the rage these days, and everyone wants a slice of the pie, regardless if it's for your own site refresh, or something you want to pitch to your next client. Responsive design has exploded in the past year, as can be easily evident by the number of large (and small) sites adopting responsive techniques to serve content to ALL devices at once using the same codebase.

This session will assume that you have a current understanding of what responsive and mobile-first are, and that you come to this session ready to learn EXACTLY how to incorporate these technologies now in your Drupal projects.

This session will guide you through the methods to actually implement responsive, mobile-first themes in Drupal, today... On your way out the door when this session ends, you'll be armed with the latest knowledge, tools, and inspiration to skip a time slot or two after the session, and start hacking away at your own responsive design!!

	                              alright let's go ahead and get started                               can everybody hear me in the back all                               good thank you welcome hope everybody's                               having a good morning had a chance to                               see Luke's keynote on mobile mobile                               first and hopefully anything you learned                               there i won't say something different                               because he was probably right today                               we'll be talking about creating                                responsive and mobile first drupal                                themes my name is jake strong i'm the                                creator of the omega theme wow thanks i                                thought you guys wanted to talk about                                fusion or something like that i have a                                little tiny dev shot development geeks                                and will soon be launching a premium                                theme community thing geeks what you                                should probably already know if you                                don't i don't know flag me down device                                detection is bad you know we shouldn't                                be targeting an iphone specifically a                                blackberry specifically that defeats all                                the new all the purposes of the new                                movements were seeing with responsive                                and mobile first you should already know                                that responsive web design is good and                                awesome even if you really don't know                                how to implement it yet you should also                                know those of you that have tried it and                                those of you that haven't it isn't                                necessarily easy some of the concepts                                are but it takes a lot of patience a lot                                of a lot of practice and lastly still to                                this point responsive web design is not                                for everybody I've worked on a couple                                projects that asked for responsive and                                at the end I wish they wouldn't have                                their budget their thought processes                                just didn't really fit with a responsive                                approach yet but hopefully you know with                                the little our little asterisks                                hopefully if the future evolves                                everybody will start turning to these                                types of technologies what I hope to                                give you today is a quick understanding                                of responsive media queries                                an overview of creating a responsive                                theme from scratch so kind of going                                through step by step of if you want to                                build your own responsive theme not use                                any of the base themes that are                                currently out there the things you need                                to think about what you need to approach                                and then finally I'll only take a short                                few minutes to promote Omega I tend to                                kind of get in trouble for doing that                                too much so first responsive css                                       queries in just about five minutes and                                there's a lot of stuff in media queries                                but we're really only going to focus on                                the small group that will help us get to                                the basics of what we need for                                responsive and the first of those is                                min-width and hopefully everybody in the                                back can see well enough I kind of                                touched that it and it looked okay what                                we have here are a couple sample media                                queries the first one being media all                                and min with                                                     essentially refers to the minimum width                                of the viewport so at                                                   first media query any CSS that you apply                                in there is only going to apply to a                                viewport to a browser window that's more                                than                                                                 next with a min width of                                         browser window that's twelve undred                                pixels or more any CSS in there will                                start to apply the next is min device                                width and the media queries you see are                                the same except for replacing                                device-width instead of just width                                device-width refers to the entire window                                on a mobile device on your iPhone on                                your iPad where you don't have windowed                                browsing you can't shrink your browser                                min-width and min device with are                                exactly the same value on your desktop                                browser where you can scale the size of                                it if you use min-width it's referring                                to the size of the browser window window                                however far down you scale it if you've                                used min device                                with instead it would refer to the still                                the entire size of the device of the                                imac whatever it may be and on the same                                note we have max width I tend not to use                                max width in my own media queries except                                for very limited circumstances using the                                 same the same example here media all and                                 max width is                                                             apply to anything that's                                             when you're taking a mobile first                                 approach you actually want to have                                 everything start off as mobile and then                                 you want to say okay if with using min                                 with you want to say if we do have that                                 minimum with maybe                                                       add some CSS we want to display it                                 differently max width you can                                 essentially combine that with your                                 min-width and have certain rules only                                 apply between maybe                                                      reason for using max width by itself                                 would be if you were attempting to                                 backport a site that did not have                                 anything mobile you could take and use a                                 max width of you know                                                    the CSS and there would then apply to                                 modern browsers on small handheld                                 devices max device width also same thing                                 it refers to the entire window itself                                 again on mobile they're the same                                 and finally one of the really fun media                                 queries that somebody recently asked me                                 if I what did I use them for and it's                                 actually kind of hard to say yet I                                 really haven't found a great use case                                 where these are super useful but I found                                 them fun to play with is the orientation                                 and you have obviously just landscape                                 and portrait so on your iPhone your                                 Android your iPad whatever device you're                                 able to target the direction in which                                 it's being held this can be you know I                                 think I think there are use cases for                                 this but if you're still targeting                                 certain pixel sizes with min or max with                                 you can end up coming to the same                                 essentially the same working model with                                 an iPad                                                                one of those is portrait and which one                                 is landscape                                 now again so I don't pimp out the Omega                                 theme too much today we're going to talk                                 about doing it yourself and because                                 responsive design is unique and we're                                 still learning the best practices how to                                 put these things together a lot of                                 projects you may work on you know maybe                                 it's really simple and some of the some                                 of the base themes that implement                                 responsive maybe it is too much and                                 maybe you just need you know the                                 simplest way you can implement it maybe                                 you feel like you just don't need all                                 the extra junk and you can do it quicker                                 and even better yourself so for that                                 reason it may be good to start from                                 scratch with the responsive theme this                                 slide might be hard to see in the back                                 but essentially any responsive theme                                 just starts off as a normal drupal theme                                 there's nothing fancy in it this is just                                 a sample dot info with a name and a                                 description and some regions defined                                 down at the bottom nothing fancy going                                 on in here and I have a couple methods i                                 want to discuss of adding your                                 responsive CSS first off again when we                                 want to take this mobile first approach                                 I feel that everything should be                                 developed that way there is no other way                                 start with mobile or build your                                 framework in a way that maybe even if                                 you do the CSS for the larger version                                 first you still have the ability to come                                 back and build your mobile your mobile                                 CSS later but it still applies first so                                 in this example in our dot info I'm                                 adding the way we always do style sheets                                 all and a global CSS this is going to be                                 my site wide font default everything                                 everything that I want to apply globally                                 and this includes my mobile layout the                                 next one we see is one that I've                                 targeted for a larger tablet and it's                                 style sheets all and                                 men with                                                              know and if you haven't done it you know                                 every style sheet we've ever included in                                 our themes was you know style sheets all                                 maybe screen or print you can put in the                                 full media query right here so what that                                 gives me with tablet CSS is a way that I                                 don't need to put the media query in my                                 file and tablet CSS is only going to be                                 invoked when that media query is true                                 and then the third example was a min                                 width of                                                           layout something just a little larger so                                 this method and adding the CSS files in                                 this way lets us keep our CSS files                                 organized I don't need I don't want to                                 have necessarily one CSS file with                                 hundreds of different media query is                                 nested in it that you know just becomes                                 too large and too hard to manage so if                                 we take a look at an example of                                 something i would put in my global CSS                                 and i'm using the example in all of                                 these of just my content and sidebar                                 regions and maybe how i would position                                 them so by default again global CSS is                                 doing my mobile layout it's doing all my                                 site wide defaults so on mobile i'm just                                 going to stack these regions they're                                 just me one on top of the other so                                 they've got a hundred percent with font                                 color is going to be black and we use a                                 serif font but once I've moved up now to                                 my tablet CSS which we defined at                                     pixels it could be                                                       you choose I've decided now that I want                                 some layout with my regions and so I've                                 given my content                                                        the one side on the sidebar you know                                 almost twenty or twenty four percent                                 floated it off to the right so you're on                                 the mobile device you're going to see                                 them stacked as you move into the tablet                                 we're going to start handling some more                                 advanced layout based on the real estate                                 we have                                 and then finally moving to my desktop                                 CSS example I've decided that you know                                 for whatever reason on my tablet I                                 wanted the content on the left but now I                                 actually wanted on the right so in this                                 example I've changed the width of the                                 content region and I floated it to the                                 right and I've added some extra stuff to                                 the side bar I've made it a little wider                                 moved it over to the left instead and                                 changed the color in the background on                                 it so going through this method with                                 global tablet desktop CSS and in my own                                 practice that's not what I named them                                 but this allows us to continue moving                                 from our global defaults and as we move                                 up each media query that are all using                                 min-width as soon as we pass a certain                                 width on the viewport window we will                                 start to apply different CSS                                 yes I'm sorry the slides are actually                                 already up on my blog development geeks                                 com it's linked from the session node                                 yes but we'll save that for the cue and                                 eggs that's a great question okay so in                                 the second method rather than breaking                                 up all the CSS files you can choose to                                 put it all in to put it all into one you                                 could actually do all this with one                                 style sheet but in this example I'm                                 going to go ahead and just do my global                                 and then a response at CSS and they're                                 both loaded with style sheets all so the                                 responsive CSS is going to be loaded all                                 the time but inside of that then we're                                 going to place our media queries and                                 nest them so that they work so my first                                 example again my global CSS is exactly                                 the same just some basic site-wide                                 defaults so again responsive CSS here in                                 this method is going to allow you to put                                 everything in there from top to bottom                                 and have it all organized in one file                                 and so to start off this is an entire                                 you know a short but complete example of                                 what this responsive CSS may looked at                                 look like based on the previous example                                 so if you were using the method of                                 actually only having one CSS file period                                 you would start at the top and put in                                 all your defaults you know body to find                                 some headers fonts whatever you want to                                 do and then nest it in this file we'll                                 start with our lowest our lowest                                 resolution we want to target place our                                 media query and then inside that nest                                 any overrides that need to apply to                                 stuff that was previously declared                                 either outside of a media query in this                                 file or declared in our global CSS so we                                 can continue on and target a larger                                 screen at                                                                file put as many media queries as you                                 want I do find actually that this can be                                 beneficial especially if you're using                                 something like a fluid layout to                                 I started personally liking fluid                                 layouts a lot to a certain extent and                                 then giving a more structure at a couple                                 break points but in a fluid layout                                 there's a lot of extra media queries you                                 might want to do because if your fluid                                 encompasses maybe                                                       may be some extra shifts and ways you                                 want to change things as the screen                                 grows or shrinks so digging a little                                 more into this example taking the first                                 sample media query I've brought back the                                 same code and am styling up my content                                 region and my sidebar and then again for                                 what was the desktop CSS in the first                                 example still in our same responsive                                 file now I'm just over writing the                                 values changing the changing the width                                 and positioning of these elements                                 now some things to think about when                                 implementing responsive design the                                 responsive images is usually a pretty                                 simple process in your CSS a max width                                 of a hundred percent as most of you                                 should have already learned about will                                 scale your image so that it just works                                 at whatever size its container element                                 is this can also work on flash embedded                                 videos as well there's also some jQuery                                 plugins that will help with the other                                 elements fit vids I know worked really                                 well for me recently there's a minor                                 problem in the latest releases of Drupal                                                                                                        actually care about older versions of ie                                 in Drupal                                                            that anything that was ran through theme                                 image had to have the height and width                                 attribute placed in the image tag in the                                 modern browser in modern browsers any of                                 the new stuff it works fine there's no                                 issue with having the height than width                                 in the attributes of the image tag                                 however if you go back to ie                                            they just do some crazy things some of                                 them won't scale the height that all you                                 can try putting in height auto and you                                 have to do a lot of tweaking for myself                                 if I'm doing this in every project and                                 somebody might try to stab me after                                 saying this I actually override my theme                                 image to not include height than with a                                 tribute on the image tag nobody roared                                 so I guess nobody really cares about                                 that                                 the viewport tag the viewport meta tag                                 exactly it was taking a copy of the                                 female unction and just removing those                                 two attributes from ever getting applied                                 the viewport made attack potentially one                                 of the most important things to consider                                 for mobile layout and I forget whether                                 it was WebKit or Mozilla that you know                                 initially started this now all all                                 mobile browsers handle this and                                 understand the viewport tag and what it                                 does is allow us to define the initial                                 scale of the page the minimum scale the                                 maximum scale and if the users allowed                                 to pinch and zoom on the page that's                                 what gave us when nobody had mobile                                 sites the ability for the New York Times                                 to scale down on your little three and a                                 half inch iphone screen and have it look                                 decent and then you know let you zoom in                                 and see what you wanted on the page and                                 actually get to your content and that                                 worked great that was a great                                 implementation on the mobile side so                                 that you know the majority of sites out                                 there looked decent once you start                                 implementing a responsive design you                                 actually highly consider what this does                                 iphone ipad all iOS devices and new                                 Android devices work well with viewport                                 are with the user scalable set to turn                                 on right now I think there's still some                                 debate if you're supplying somebody with                                 a mobile layout you're providing big                                 enough you know action elements                                 everythin's are big enough to click the                                 Texas is big enough to read there's                                 still a debate if you should allow the                                 user to scale or not I've heard                                 arguments for both this week and both                                 arguments have actually been valid you                                 know somebody wanted to zoom in on an                                 image or you know what i thought was big                                 enough text wasn't still wasn't good                                 enough for somebody's eyes so they're                                 used to pinching and zooming the biggest                                 problem is the older versions of android                                 when you're providing your media queries                                 and your defaults or mobile if you allow                                 usually the initial scale is always                                 going to be one but let's say you set                                 the maximum scale                                                        zoom in a full hundred percent and see                                 you know twice see everything twice as                                 large and then if you set the user                                 scalable to yes these android devices                                 the older ones would not quite get it                                 right it would mess up it would start                                 thinking your browser window is bigger                                 it would start trying to load a bigger                                 media query and I haven't really played                                 with this in some time I haven't tested                                 it yet on the ice cream sandwich version                                 but all in all this is something quite                                 important to think about you can play                                 around with these settings really easily                                 and then test on your device and see                                 what it allows you to do test your use                                 cases and see if see if it's worth it                                 for you to have the scalable on or off                                 this example and again yes the slides                                 will be available to actually look at                                 some of this code closer implementing                                 the viewport meta tag is just using the                                 Drupal add HTML head function and you                                 build out your array with the                                 appropriate values now that it's a made                                 a tag the name is viewport and all the                                 information for the content of the made                                 a tag                                 old crappy e browsers who actually cares                                 about any of those show hands seriously                                 oh really that was way too many of you                                 I'm sorry you may not want to but you                                 have to I get it it's okay when you're                                 using a mobile first approach one issue                                 you're going to run across is well older                                 versions of ie and maybe some other                                 browsers don't understand media queries                                 at all and if you're using the method                                 where your global or mobile dot CSS is                                 loaded first and everything else is then                                 loaded by a media query I six is going                                 to load the mobile version of your site                                 and so somebody's on a big resolution                                 monitor but it has ie                                                   gonna get your mobile your mobile                                 version which personally again I really                                 don't care but some of your clients are                                 you know going to expect the normal                                 version of the site if you're doing your                                 theme from scratch I would recommend                                 probably conditional stylesheets module                                 essentially a way to you know                                 conditionally load for IE six through                                 eight and make sure that they're getting                                 still you know the                                                     desktop it is and not providing anything                                 responsive to those browsers I do have a                                 theoretical problem with using the                                 JavaScript enhancements i believe it was                                 respond jas that allows allow some of                                 the older versions of ie to understand                                 media queries I personally don't think                                 that's worth it I don't think that's                                 time well invested on a responsive                                 project and I feel that you know a                                 browser that doesn't understand it                                 should be you know more than just suited                                 fine by getting the normal desktop size                                 something fun never to forget would be                                 your touch I killing by default I                                 actually don't know how Android does                                 this but on iOS if you send a shortcut                                 to your to your desktop there you're                                 going to                                 have like a screenshot of your screen                                 shrunk way down so you know just like                                 you'd put a favicon on your site don't                                 forget a touch icon and there is                                 actually a module for that now project /                                 touch underscore icons and it allows you                                 to just in your theme settings attach                                 attach the appropriately sized images                                 there if you're not using the module                                 though again is very helpful Drupal add                                 HTML head function you can quickly just                                 add in the link tribute and path to your                                 pastor your image and defined it as an                                 apple touch icon and you're good to go                                 now this is where a lot of you may                                 disagree I've heard a lot of back and                                 forth on this don't target certain sizes                                 don't target a size because it's the                                 width of a certain device but some great                                 points to keep in mind and there are                                 potentially many more than this and I've                                 even been told that my                                            thought you know needs to grow to                                 provide a larger format but a                                            media Prairie would you know accommodate                                 most larger screens I have a small                                 MacBook Pro and it actually fits you                                 know full size on that                                               it's going to target some smaller                                 desktop screens that somebody's still                                 got an older monitor or large tablets in                                 landscape mode                                                        your portrait on the larger tablets and                                 potentially landscape on some smaller                                   or                                                                    middle ground I know the Kindle uses it                                 and some of the smaller tablets will                                 also get that around that size then your                                                                                                          sizes I think the majority is moving                                 past                                                                   not really to to worry about targeting                                 I'll tend maybe on anything I'm doing                                 like                                    or less you know give it a nice stacked                                 layout have everything set up there so                                 there's a lot of documentation and you                                 know on various places online about what                                 should you be targeting and I think from                                 now for the next year this is going to                                 change every other week so you know in                                 my own theme I came up with what I what                                 I kind of thought was best but allowed                                 everybody to just change it if you so                                 choose so whatever your project is                                 whatever your clients and needs are a                                 lot of times I may only target one or                                 two of those rather than four or five                                 so with all that said building a                                 responsive drupal theme from scratch can                                 be fun to be rewarding but it can take                                 in a lot of patience and attention to                                 detail and it can be kind of tough                                 especially if you've got a client that                                 doesn't quite understand the whole                                 process what if your client has a budget                                 what if you just want it to kind of work                                 out of the box                                 the Omega theme is responsive it was the                                 first Drupal                                                      correct me on that the first major base

         as much of the you know the junk I just                                 went through on what you have to think                                 about when you're building it yourself                                 it'll give you all that out of the box                                 and allow you just to go to town and                                 making it what you want it to be omega

with                                 some of that about                                                      so now both of those have out of both of                                 those distributions out of the box have                                 a responsive Omega theme ready to go and                                 they're still work getting starter kits                                 and things like that in there to further                                 customize those open enterprise which                                 was recently released by level                                         haven't set it yet as their default                                 theme on install that distribution but                                 also use it also has a responsive Omega                                 sub theme included in the back                                 Omega has grits and this has kind of                                 been highly debated this week I've been                                 a huge fan of                                                       first Drupal talks were all on using                                     like the theory like the structure like                                 it a lot out of the box right now Omega                                 comes with four sizes besides the mobile                                 you have a                                                                                                                                   these using the                                                     gutters and margins and all that so                                 everything applies the same way at each                                 of these grid sizes some of the talk                                 we've been having this week is actually                                 moving towards what other alternatives                                 there may be people have been bringing                                 it up to me for you know well over a                                 year of can we implement this grid can                                 we implement this grid and I find myself                                 these days actually even fighting                                 against                                                                 so some of my next work is going to be                                 really investigating how to better do                                 the grids how to add alternatives how to                                 make things that don't necessarily rely                                 on that                                                                 it works it's went on over                                              and it worked quite well as it is omega                                 has some friends the Omega tools module                                 allows you to generate sub themes in                                 drush or in one of the more recent                                 releases six months ago or so in the                                 user interface you can walk through give                                 your theme a name a description edit all                                 the details at the last moment and it                                 will create your sub theme for you and                                 place it in your themes directory the                                 Delta module will allow you to and Delta                                 actually works with anything that's the                                 theme settings heavy would be a good                                 approach it'll allow you to essentially                                 take a copy of your theme settings so in                                 omega we define all the region wit salt                                 placements we do all this cool stuff in                                 the settings and that applies site-wide                                 well what if you want to do that for the                                 whole do something different for the                                 homepage deltal allows you to do that                                 based on context omega is always                                 changing and growing we had a boss                                 yesterday that was talking about some of                                 the immediate needs and then what what                                 some people want to see out of it in the                                 future our                                                              very quickly it's good to have entirely                                 rewritten starter CSS that everybody's                                 going to like and stop complaining about                                 the code I wrote three years ago that's                                 still in there we're going to add the                                 feature to nest regions via the                                 interface and this has been probably the                                 biggest feature that was left out of                                 Omega                                                                  time so you'll be able to essentially                                 have that sidebar that scales past many                                 other regions that are nested inside of                                 a region there's some performance and                                 right to left support patches waiting to                                 go in that both look pretty good so this                                 next upcoming version is really going to                                 be focusing on the interface now the                                 usability also some inline documentation                                 on the theme settings page I was told it                                 needed more we've also started talking                                 about where Omega                                                  envision it will start soon and we're                                 you know definitely looking at d                                       Omega will be there the day Drupal                                   comes out and finally one of the biggest                                 things that's really not finally sorry                                 one of the biggest things that's kind of                                 helped with the adoption of Omega is the                                 community that's evolved around yet we                                 now have documentation on drupal.org we                                 have an IRC channel that I've been told                                 this week is one of the light most                                 actives they've seen outside of really                                 the core Drupal channels some you know                                 really impressed by that there's always                                 like                                                                     of people you know helping answer some                                 questions                                 do you have a group on G do and finally                                 again soon I've been talking about this                                 for many years but soon there will be a                                 premium theme store with all mobile                                 responsive Omega sub themes an upcoming                                 webinar next week myself Michael Schmidt                                 and Katherine Cornelius of amazing labs                                 will be doing an aqua a webinar on kind                                 of the same thing responsive web design                                 using Omega how to make it all happen                                 our lessons learned using it and where                                 it can go most importantly Omega has                                 stickers and you can come up and grab                                 some once we're done here but but truly                                 most importantly two and a half three                                 years ago when I started ohmega ng                                     was all me that we know nobody found it                                 yet nobody knew this has grown into                                 quite a community project and without                                 all of these guys here where Omega is                                 that today would not be possible                                 and that you can help too if you're                                 interested I've had a bunch of people                                 come up to me I want to help with                                 documentation whatever it may be join                                 the IRC get in the gdo group send out a                                 message and you know one of us will                                 connect with you and figure out figure                                 out how to make that happen for QA if                                 you can hit the microphone so that                                 everybody can hear it and while we do                                 questions and answers i will be showing                                 just some Omega sites in the background                                 so                                 I actually have a question about doing                                 sort of responsive stuff what if you're                                 you're trying to show less regions when                                 you're on a smaller browser size right                                 so would you just do in talking like                                 purely CSS would you just do display                                 none is our way other programmatic way                                 that you would not show of given a                                 region a very valid question question                                 essentially what do you do to hide                                 regions on a mobile site I don't think                                 anybody has come up with a perfect                                 solution for that yet and I may be wrong                                 but I display none I just hide it it                                 just doesn't show I've also seen                                 articles where that's not the right way                                 because actually on a mobile device they                                 shouldn't be crippled and not see all of                                 the content I don't necessarily agree                                 with that there's certain elements I                                 don't feel like need to be on my mobile                                 site I played with a method using                                 actually Ajax to you know load up the                                 mobile version first and if it was                                 bigger than now go ahead and load in                                 those extra regions or blocks or                                 whatever it may have been and i found                                 that kind of a hacky slow nasty way to                                 do it there should be a better way and                                 hopefully with d                                                    context and mobile initiatives all of                                 this like hopefully there will be a                                 better way for that but for now I mean                                 I'm satisfied with the display none and                                 the way I look at it performance wise if                                 we didn't have a responsive mobile site                                 they'd still be getting the full website                                 just shrunk down with all the images all                                 the all the junk so                                 question about apple wedding at this                                 place they have the high resolutions I'm                                 sorry you speak up just a little sorry a                                 question about the Apple writing at this                                 place they have the higher resolutions                                 but they will they get to mobile website                                 or the normal website and how would you                                 handle that that is great question the                                 new the new high res Apple the ipad I                                 was very concerned when I first saw that                                 you know double the pixels and what does                                 that mean for the browser I did get to                                 test one at the apple store when I got                                 to town it's actually just a pixel                                 density so it's still like as the web                                 browser sees it and I may be wrong but                                 I'm pretty sure I'm I've got this nailed                                 so far it's still a                                                     it just is twice the density so if you                                 have some low res images it might start                                 to look fuzzy but otherwise you know it                                 would be silly because like if all of a                                 sudden it was you know whatever that new                                 number is wide                                                                                                                                  would be kind of silly if like it was                                 showing a giant you know resolution so                                 so far from what I've seen it doesn't                                 change with that new device resolution                                 regarding the theme image override to                                 take out the height and width how does                                 that affect users ability to resize an                                 image in the WYSIWYG and do stuff like                                 that to resize the image in the WYSIWYG                                 or something along those lines doesn't                                 does it prevent adding hung and with                                 attributes in a WYSIWYG                                 you can still add that you know                                 depending on your method of getting an                                 image and there was awake i know there's                                 you know tons of ways right now i mean                                 you can you can still put that in or                                 leave it out I've just had some problems                                 with it like I and I found like looking                                 at the first versions of Drupal                                        well the height then what values were                                 just empty so you know they fix that                                 hole or bug if you actually call it that                                 and again the only issue with that item                                 within their we're with older versions                                 of ie and if the you know image was                                 wider than the container and ie                                        to scale it down its kayla with right                                 but it would still be like super tall                                 it's just something to account you know                                 pay attention to as you go along with                                 you know all the content everything                                 you're putting in and make sure it make                                 sure it looks right in whatever you're                                 testing I think                                 regarding your do-it-yourself method one                                 which is the multiple different style                                 sheets one for each different breakpoint                                 how does the browser handle downloading                                 that is it are they all downloaded and                                 cached and parsed on every page load                                 regardless of whether or not they're                                 needed or is it downloaded at needed and                                 what are the performance implications on                                 a mobile site for that they are on every                                 page and this is the same method that                                 Omega uses and the way the Drupal add                                 CSS get CSS works with those media                                 queries is you know it combines all                                 those style sheets that are in the same                                 group modular theme and goes into all                                 these things but actually each media                                 query then also gets its own group so it                                 ends up getting compressed as its own                                 style sheet so I mean I don't know if                                 you had ten you know if you implemented                                 ten CSS files with that method you'd                                 start getting you know maybe too many                                 files loaded but I haven't seen much                                 with you know with all the CSS files                                 that modules add I don't feel too bad at                                 and you know four or five of my own so                                 if you implement the rules for detecting                                 portrait and landscape mode do they take                                 effect in real time if you change the                                 orientation of your iOS device the last                                 time I played with it yes when I tested                                 it on my iPad and just you know use the                                 portrait and landscape to test it out                                 and switch and you know as soon as the                                 page starts to move it's like oh here i                                 am that's prob and do you have any plans                                 on using preprocessors like SAS with                                 your thing                                 right now actually you can use like the                                 SAS SCSS or whatever you can actually                                 include those we have definitely talked                                 i personally use less a couple of other                                 maintainer czar using SAS they're trying                                 to convert me I don't know if I believe                                 yet but there will be some method of                                 that potentially in the forex branch                                 that will allow you to do a lot of grid                                 configuration and things like that on                                 the back end that may rely on a module                                 so the theme may still have to provide                                 something that's default this is what it                                 is but if you install this helper module                                 you know you'll get to do a whole bunch                                 of cool stuff with that it's definitely                                 in the works how does Drupal                                         caching and the anonymous page caching                                 work with the different media queries                                 well they can be cashed fine I mean                                 everything I gretton I have a couple                                 that are you know running on varnish and                                 a pc and all that stuff with you know no                                 problems to the anonymous side I mean                                 they should be getting this you know                                 those should be pretty much kind of site                                 wide so i don't think there would ever                                 be an issue so well I don't think I                                 still understand so Drupal                                               if you have different layouts for say                                 four different sizes is it actually                                 caching for nonnamous users for                                 different pages not the pages it's just                                 the CSS it's just the four additional                                 there's for CSS files that are always                                 there and it's the CSS on the client                                 side that sees oh it changed now let me                                 look at the CSS file thanks I was                                 wondering what javascript libraries you                                 were looking at to incorporate into the                                 theme I know you have formalized and all                                 that are you looking                                 to incorporate things like image sizer                                 bias or                                 I think that's potentially a good idea                                 implementing a few libraries that will                                 help out actually formalize is going to                                 get kicked out in the next version it'll                                 be there for legacy support but not                                 recommended you know I tried the fit vid                                 which worked amazing on YouTube and                                 Vimeo videos I haven't played with any                                 of the image ones because I've just got                                 the CSS that worked enough for me in my                                 own projects you know if there's some                                 really good examples and their their                                 licensing is so that it can be included                                 in the theme on GD on drupal.org you                                 know I don't see a problem with that you                                 know in as we've gone along more and                                 more solutions have come out to help                                 with some of these you know issues or                                 gotchas that we're dealing with so if                                 there's some good ones out there i'm                                 definitely game to look at them or                                 recommend them aside you know download                                 this and put it here with Omega or                                 include him if I can I was wondering                                 what your thought process was on the use                                 of pixels for font sizes of a theme and                                 what may be ongoing what your thoughts                                 are maybe it's emser remsen that's the                                 other approach well everyone I have                                 always been pixel like I want it I want                                 to know what it is I never had luck                                 trying to learn how to use ems and get                                 you know then all the sudden I've got a                                 li li and it's you know blowing up twice                                 the size i just never successful at that                                 so i hated he ends and it was recently                                 brought to my attention this REM and                                 css                                                                    solution and i think that the next                                 version of Omega will probably include                                 that it'll have the you know pixel fall                                 back for anything that was that doesn't                                 understand the css                                                       for pretty much everything that                                 understands the omega site because you                                 know none of the media queries work                                 outside of CSS                                                        are they look promising                                 thanks cool                                 there's still a couple more slides any                                 more questions                                 there's actually a lot of screenshots in                                 here                                 yes                                 ok                                 alright so the question is you know on                                 going mobile first you kind of want to                                 send them a low res image but you've got                                 a huge desktop site that needs high                                 resolution what do you do for me                                 personally right now I don't do anything                                 I look at it as the fact that if I                                 didn't have a mobile responsive site                                 again they'd still be getting the full                                 site scaled down they'd still be gettin                                 those big images does something need to                                 be done yes and I don't know that                                 anybody's come up with a perfect                                 solution yet you can load that you can                                 you know do some trickery you can load                                 that small res image then you can use                                 something else to fire off and determine                                 that oh hey now we do have at least a                                 thousand pixels to work with load the                                 big one the Drupal the module I believe                                 adaptive image handles that right now                                 I've only played with it like for a                                 couple of minutes it looks promising and                                 essentially does that loads it allows                                 you to set your media queries                                 breakpoints whatever it is and then load                                 in a bigger image okay I see a lot of                                 adaptive sites that sort of looked great                                 at one size but then it some other sizes                                 they sort of have these big awkward open                                 spaces or they get really cramped in                                 certain areas and I'm wondering if                                 there's certain tools out there that you                                 use to sort of show a little more a                                 little less content resize headline                                 stuff like that mm any best practices                                 that you know trying to figure that out                                 seems to just be on a project-by-project                                 basis of you know maybe you know maybe                                 from my designer I only got the full                                 desktop size photoshop and I've got to                                 translate it I tend to just have to go                                 you know page by page and look at each                                 of these elements and see how they                                 appear and if I'm looking at it you know                                 in portrait mode on an iPad and it just                                 looks horrible you know I'll attack it                                 case by case basis I can't say that I                                 have any best practices there except a                                  lot of attention to detail alright thank                                  you what do you think about Morton                                  decays mothership theme and paring down                                  on some of the divs and classes yep I'm                                  not quite as much of a seal it as a                                  Martin is about it but yeah the markup                                  is just you know nasty all the way                                  around my only fear though is you know                                  putting                                                                   the theme and the support issues that                                  causes I mean it's horrible like you                                  know with nested fields and stuff like                                  that and you're twenty divs down yeah I                                  don't I don't guess though I have a                                  giant personal hatred of it because so                                  it added you know                                                 download a huge page like you know I                                  just sent the user                                                      to so I don't look at it as a major                                  problem but it'd be great maybe if I'd                                  like to see mothership go to core like                                  the the markup from that to kind of go                                  that way and then go from there but                                  hi you mentioned the nested regions                                  upcoming yes with that allow you to                                  easily stack regions vertically for                                  example yes within region they will or s                                  region it'll allow you to essentially                                  create a another element I don't know if                                  it'll be a region or sort of a pseudo                                  region yet essentially creating a rapper                                  that can be placed in a zone it could                                  sit beside a region and it can also have                                  regions inside of it so that will allow                                  you to do any layout you could possibly                                  could be the final step of you can build                                  anything with it that was the seriously                                  the one oversight in the mark-up and                                  what I see it more and more in every                                  design I do some sort of you know                                  there's a full width thing here but                                  there's two sidebars right below it and                                  there's a side bar that goes the whole                                  way down yeah I think in some of the                                  ways I've come across it you almost want                                  a region that doesn't take up any space                                  so that might also kind of solve that as                                  well so looking forward to that thanks a                                  lot yeah                                  first of all thanks second                                  how does this stack regions are the                                  regions in place or nested regions work                                  in conjunction with panels in place or                                  the panel's drag-and-drop UI is it                                  working with or in adjacent to or in                                  support of maybe talk to that that's not                                  sure if they're related or not well                                  that's a good question i think that                                  there shouldn't be many problems if                                  you're just you know you're essentially                                  in you know on the omega side only                                  create only configuring your region                                  sizing and placement you should be able                                  to put anything you want if it's a                                  panels layout or something to be dumped                                  into a region and there shouldn't be any                                  issues you know unless you know until                                  you're using something in panels that's                                  going to replace the content and                                  sidebars of the main area and then you                                  should be able to just do it on the                                  panel set i guess my question was more                                  or less related to could the two of them                                  work together instead of trying to                                  create something in addition to or                                  another type of                                  region layout you I rights been to that                                  I would say no that kind of has to be on                                  the on the side of who's the super                                  panels fans that are using Omega as well                                  and you know putting something together                                  there God yeah come preference but thank                                  you yep maybe a small tip I went to the                                  session faster mobile sites yesterday                                  okay and we should be concerned about                                  the many dates that we use in our front                                  and theme on mobile sites like ninety                                  seven percent of the latency discussed                                  by the front end and not the back end so                                  we really should make the sites as small                                  as possible and really focus on mobile                                  first loading into smaller images the                                  smaller CSS files in those kind of                                  things and just responsibly loading the                                  bigger images Fresno I do agree and I                                  mean that's you know everybody said that                                  even starting from a year ago with                                  responsive and mobile first but nobody                                  really nobody figured out the best                                  method yet and we're finally starting to                                  see those methods so a lot of guys are                                  coming up that could help us do that                                  yeah so yeah so the Clara finally on the                                  last comment yes you should definitely                                  worried about sending a                                                  image to your mobile browser do I worry                                  about it right now now don't care I got                                  a fast download speeds so                                  all right thank you everybody                                  don't forget your Omega stickers
