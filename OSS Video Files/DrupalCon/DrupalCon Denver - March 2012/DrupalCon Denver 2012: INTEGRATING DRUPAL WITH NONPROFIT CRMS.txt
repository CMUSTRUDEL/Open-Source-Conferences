                              excellent so we're kind of going to kind                                of do this session in two parts the                                first part is we're going to do an                                overview of nonprofit CRMs that                                integrate with Drupal we'll also talk                                about those that don't so we'll cover                                kind of run the gamut so we're going to                                talk about ones that don't have any                                active contribs will then go into kind                                of split the integration or the                                nonprofit crm integration to two things                                ones with light integration and then                                ones with deep integration and then                                following that so that's kind of more of                                a survey of what's out there some of                                that you guys may or may not know but I                                kind of compiled it all from what song                                do and then after that we're actually                                going to do deep dives sorry okay                                come out up people come on up come                                closer it's a giant room please come                                come to us or don't after that we're                                going to do a deep dive into three                                things chris is going to cover the                                convenient aggression that free flow has                                done I'm going to talk about springboard                                and Salesforce integration and then sean                                is going to cover as he said native CRM                                in Drupal and then after that we'll do                                some questions and we'll get the hell                                out of here sound good all right so                                before we get started how many people                                are working at a nonprofit organization                                lots of nonprofits how many people are                                here from a shop that works with                                nonprofits okay so lots of those about                                how many people are developers lots of                                developers and then how many largest                                kind of business user type administrator                                types okay all right so we're not going                                to get too deep into code I don't think                                we can but time is not going to allow                                for a lot of that so if you want to talk                                code level you know hit us up after this                                we are going to be showing some                                front-end stuff will be showing some                                admin admin interfaces and we'll be                                talking more around integration and how                                many people are still hungover from last                                night yes excellent thank you all right                                well without further ado let's get                                started shall we alright so the first                                set of CRMs that we're going to talk                                about are ones that don't have any                                active Drupal contribs action kit how                                many people are familiar with action kit                                so this is basically the people that                                built the move on platform it's used by                                organizations like one org I think                                there's a variety of organizations and                                 just recently I would say it's the last                                 two years year and a half they actually                                 started selling it as action kit                                 there is an API so there really isn't                                 really a reason why there shouldn't be a                                 Drupal integration with action kit but                                 it's probably just one of those things                                 that someone's never built it or needed                                 it is anyone using action kit no action                                 kit users okay blackbaud sphere also                                 known as cantera sphere everyone                                 familiar with that heard of it no there                                 is no Drupal integration they do have an                                 API and but there is nothing on                                 contribute to earth Drupal i'm pretty                                 sure people have done some integration                                 work but it's it hasn't at least as far                                 as i know hasn't been contributed back                                 to the community is anyone using black                                 bone sphere okay and you have Drupal                                 sites as well razor's edge okay so                                 razor's edge is more of your offline                                 donor management and sphere would be                                 your kind of ecrm net community yeah                                 that which integrates with razor's edge                                 yeah that is an alternative to spear                                 it's a little less full-featured more                                 about fundraising forms and then                                 Blackbaud has a new enterprise CRM                                 anyone using that probably not because                                 as far as we can tell it's paper no I                                 it's a yes unclear where it is in the in                                 the space of development I know that                                 they're selling it but I don't I don't                                 think we know of anyone who's actually                                 launched on it I think they have one or                                 two works that have this is where                                 they're moving so I think it's you know                                 I don't know that they'll get rid of all                                 the other platforms but this is the                                 direction that they're going in which is                                 enterprise CRM so those three are pretty                                 large CRMs I'm sure there's a bunch of                                 other CRMs that I'm not going to touch                                 or talk about so if I miss any don't                                 hold it against me there's                                 a lot so let's talk about CRMs with                                 light integration so engaging networks                                 used to be called advocacy online they                                 rebranded as engaging networks they're                                 very popular in the international space                                 because they do international advocacy                                 and there's very few of these e CRMs                                 that have any kind of international                                 advocacy platform so they have an                                 integration of sorts we actually built                                 it as part of our International Fund for                                 Animal Welfare project and it integrates                                 with their advocacy tools and we'll get                                 into some of the features of that and                                 then Canvio online marketing not to be                                 confused with convenient ground or can                                 be illuminate this is there sort of e                                 CRM platform there is a Drupal                                 contributing it is envy you people here                                 you're using it the one that's on                                 contribute to talk to you so for the                                 engaging networks it's this is a summary                                 of what you will find on do but these                                 are the things that it integrates with                                 so engaging networks is really just                                 designed to handle the advocacy portion                                 it does pass so part of what it does is                                 it sucks in the engaging networks                                 campaigns renders them as drupal                                 webforms and then those submissions are                                 passed back to engaging networks to                                 fulfill the advocacy message to target                                 so I have asterisks on users nodes and                                 other objects because it's really not a                                 deep user integration that's not a                                 two-way sync we're literally just                                 passing it off to them you can find this                                 module on d dot oh it's you know feel                                 free to download it if you're in                                 engaging networks and anyone using                                 engaging networks okay well there you go                                 on the convene so can video has an                                 integration API there is only a sick                                 x version of it for whatever reason the                                 installs don't aren't reporting back to                                 drupal so it's tough to tell what the                                 install base is I think this integrates                                 with their rest api you know i'm pretty                                 sure it integrates with their with their                                 rest api rather than their it's not a                                 soap-based integration so and i think it                                 handles users i know that i don't know                                 that it handles anything else right so                                 no node integration no order or                                 fundraising integration and no custom                                 objects just users and theoretically you                                 can build and free flows you know chris                                 from free play will talk about their                                 integration with convene a shin api I                                 think they have an advocacy API so they                                 have other things that you can do they                                 funded the development of this at first                                 and then I think it's just kind of died                                 on the line so I know there's a lot of                                 can be use theoretically out there and                                 there's a lot of those shops that are                                 you also using Drupal so I'm sure some                                 added some added energy around                                 development there would be good so now                                 we're going to talk about CRMs that have                                 a little bit more robust integration and                                 we're talking about four there are                                 probably as i said before other CRMs                                 that we're not going to cover here but i                                 think we're getting the bulk of the net                                 forum is an association management                                 system or AMS it's built by a Vectra as                                 anyone net forum people your net for                                 music okay they actually have a variety                                 of modules and we'll go into that salsa                                 i'm sure a lot of people know who's also                                 salsa labs salsa is a crm wired for                                 change democracy in action all of that                                 is actually salsa they have an API                                 available as well with a proprietary                                 scripting language and there's actually                                 again multiple modules that power the                                 salsa integration sipi crm can't talk                                 about crm and drupal                                 without talking about CB CRM so of                                 course yes we will talk about that and                                 then sales force which is near and dear                                 to my heart we do a lot of Salesforce                                 integration there's actually contribute                                 is true that that handle the integration                                 and that's actually the one that we're                                 going to talk about today they have a                                 very robust API well-documented easy to                                 integrate with and great the other thing                                 that's good is they version their api's                                 so so in terms of net forum there are                                 and someone's gonna have to help me out                                 with this because I went through this                                 and still don't understand exactly what                                 all these modules do but they have what                                 they call the RX web interface the                                 dynamic facade nodes that have                                 authentication which I can only assume                                 is single sign-on and they have net                                 forum views which as far as i can tell                                 has been deprecated there's about                                 according to do                                                       integrating with net forum it's unclear                                 to me or even in the documentation all                                 of the things that it does but i know                                 that you can sync users and you can                                 actually render net forum content in                                 drupal and the dynamic facade notes                                 power is that the user sink is powered                                 by the authentication it looks like                                 they're doing a seven export it's not                                 ready for prime time but they have                                                                                                             while salsa you have two options so the                                 first three bars in this chart are all                                 related the salsa api and salsa rules                                 and salsa supporters they kind of go                                 together and then there is a salsa                                 integration that was built a little bit                                 later I think but Trella on could be                                 wrong someone here from Trella and                                 confirming so if you are if you're                                 running salsa you have two options                                 available to you it looks to me like the                                 API is the only one that's making a port                                                                                                      you're probably                                 not not able to integrate much there it                                 integrates users I know that and then                                 thus the salsa integration module                                 integrates nodes as well so it's a                                 little deeper than just users outside of                                 that I really it's unclear to me what                                 they're doing it if someone well so                                 later when we get to QA I would love it                                 is anyone using salsa and integrating                                 with Drupal okay so be good to hear                                 might be good to hear what you're doing                                 and how it works for you I did so when I                                 was doing this I sent out a lot of                                 emails and tried to get people who have                                 done this stuff to come and present but                                 there wasn't a lot of response so hope                                 so CP CRM so sippy CRM there's                                        there is a port                                                      there's only                                                         mean that doesn't actually compute I'm                                 sure there's a lot more Drupal sites                                 integrating with CBC RM so I don't                                 really trust that number but sippy sippy                                 has been integrated with Drupal's I                                 think since the beginning or if not                                 shortly after the beginning and it's                                 very tight integration users nodes I                                 think sibi actually renders all of the                                 forms and stuff so technically that's                                 not integration it's just sipi handling                                 the forms but it will you will be able                                 to integrate users and notes into city I                                 don't know if there's really custom                                 object support or if that kind of even                                 exists in civvy so hard to tell and then                                 finally Salesforce                                                   sales force which is surprising that's                                 very surprised by that and that doesn't                                 include the stuff that we're doing on                                 springboard and I'm sure there's other                                 one off integrations and I really here                                 focused on sort of the Salesforce suite                                 of modules does anyone using Salesforce                                 and rupal I know you                                 Marcus I so yeah you can integrate                                 pretty much anything in theory and                                 there's a lot of hooks for the things                                 that aren't out of the box there's a                                 very nice user interface for field                                 mapping to power your integration and                                 it's got it's very full-featured and                                 will actually show so when we do the                                 we're going to talk about Salesforce                                 integration later we're actually going                                 to show springboards integration but                                 it's similar to what is in contributive                                 contribs that aren't there in the                                 springboard thing so right now there is                                 a port to                                                               ready for prime time but you can you can                                 get it up you can stand it up you can                                 sync users you can sync notes with the                                 seven export but there are definites                                 definitely a little buggy I think of the                                                                                                          are seven so it's not that people people                                 are using it so good to note all right                                 that's that ends the the overview                                 portion of our how's it going is                                 everyone enjoying it isn't it fun                                 riveting right this is why we gave you                                 beer people all right um well let's I'm                                 going to turn it over to Chris and he's                                 going to talk about free flows convene                                 of integration and show kind of the                                 stuff that they've been doing                                 reach                                 full day event for nonprofits that are                                 interested in Drupal it'll be a lot of                                 talk about CRM there as well so if you                                 can head down to San Francisco for that                                 right now we've got about a hundred                                 people participating should be a really                                 good at a full day event okay so here's                                 the convio the convio api's and we                                 integrated with the donation which is a                                 client side only and then we also have                                 some into I don't know if its advocacy I                                 think its constituent which is                                 server-side so and unfortunately we have                                 a couple modules they need to be cleaned                                 up before they can be submitted to                                 Drupal there's still some hard coded                                 stuff in there because this was designed                                 as a one-off that we realized could be                                 used and convey Oh has changed their                                 client side authentication so that we                                 have to completely rewrite it still                                 works but there's no point in submitting                                 something that's going away soon so we                                 have that to do what we do with this so                                 it's a triple seven site it's just                                 running commerce kickstart with products                                 and it's a regular store we've added                                 some configuration and you get all this                                 from when you sign up with gan vou go in                                 and there's a password in here as well                                 it's obviously blanked out for demo                                 purposes what they've gotten rid of is                                 the cross domain script file and i                                 believe the API library URL they've                                 changed how they do that but initially                                 you had to download some files to your                                 site and that's gone away                                 so I guess what we do here is you go to                                 the store you purchase something and                                 we've written a payment gateway for                                 Drupal commerce that will through ajax                                 will submit it to convey Oh it'll get                                 the response back will then process the                                 form in Drupal saving all the wii blank                                 out the credit card information and then                                 you know it saves all that information                                 to Drupal so you know what somebody                                 bought and everything but the processing                                 is done through your convio account and                                 then because there was some constituent                                 data that you couldn't access through                                 donation api's we turn around and we                                 make a server-side call back to cambio                                 to update the rest of the record so it                                 just works you know this is just the                                 regular kick-start commerce Drupal                                       to cart                                 and we can go to the shopping cart                                 you check out                                 yes it does yeah so you create right and                                 there's some lost my yes there's a                                 shadow form on the backside on cambio                                 that they all get sent to it's in the                                 configuration and we can take a look at                                 that in a moment                                 user                                 yes I type this in a lot that's what                                 it's all and so we've now completed it                                 it's been processed by convio and                                 everything's been updated in Drupal and                                 right so let's see configuration the                                 donation configuration so here's the                                 donation form ID and the other cambio                                 information that you need to set up so                                 you set that up ahead first time and                                 then it passes that back and forth                                 they're there yes so that's part of the                                 server side call back afterwards is we                                 then update the Constituent record on                                 the but you can't do that through the                                 donation much ap is so it that's why we                                 have this weird two-step approach it's                                 actually a three-step because cambio                                 Drupal cambio but that's how we get                                 everything updated                                 right it's on your domain and it sends                                 it through the Ajax call                                 so                                 oh it's the JavaScript that would help                                 no what we're so as if you see here this                                 is after we get it back from the                                 response back from convio but here it's                                 commented out so that I can just run                                 these without actually sending them                                 through I just fake it but here you get                                 the key and you send it and it goes to                                 their you know through a secure Ajax                                 call so it goes over SSL to convey oh it                                 comes back we wipe out all of this data                                 and then we submit the form to Drupal                                 yes you would need this if you want to                                 be occupied                                 we're not saving the credit cards not                                 saved on your site no but its internal                                 but that page is submitted through ssl                                 doesn't okay okay                                 right that's what I only because they                                 write their only Custer it's only client                                 side                                 right well and the other thing I know                                 that Drupal commerce does not drupal                                 commerce also blanks out the credit card                                 information and they don't store that                                 just so that they could get around that                                 same issue that it is never the credit                                 card information is never stored on your                                 server at all right and by the time it                                 gets submitted to Drupal with this we've                                 already blanked it out as an extra step                                 you know                                 anything else on this                                 we all pass it over yeah do you want to                                 go if you want to do yours                                 awesome cool so I'm going to talk about                                 native crm it you could talk for way                                 more than                                                               going on in the community and I'll                                 preface it by saying that like there                                 right now there are a number of kind of                                 competing efforts which i think is a                                 really good thing towards wow that's uh                                 interesting resolution towards getting                                 serum running natively in Drupal so                                 sighs to the right                                 just one second                                 hey left you want to do this while I                                 talk I'm bringing up my Vanna White here                                 to help out with it so i'll talk about                                 it real quick while love gets the screen                                 running Thank You vana you'll have to                                 come up here I'm cool alright so native                                 CRM so the first question is why would                                 you want to do CRM natively in Drupal                                 and and also why hasn't it done been                                 done really successfully before Drupal                                   why you'd want to do in a drupal a                                 couple reasons one that a lot of them                                 we've actually talked about if you                                 really want to kind of control that the                                 workflow of user interacting with your                                 website and having association                                 management tools running you have a lot                                 more control if it's all in one system                                 another thing is you know we talked                                 about some of these api's with different                                 CRMs sometimes being fragile that is why                                 he is my business partner you know                                 sometimes API is change if you have it                                 in native billion Drupal you don't have                                 to worry about that quite as much so                                 then the question is why hasn't this                                 been done before Drupal                                               and the answer is the entity system in                                 Drupal                                                               what we're doing is and what most of the                                 movement in this is doing is creating                                 custom entity types for contacts as well                                 as relationships and memberships and                                 things like that so there's a lot of                                 benefits to it you know and from our                                 perspective it can kind of lower your                                 costs for getting into a CRM for lighter                                 weight solutions and then for folks who                                 are integrating with very large                                 solutions it can provide sort of a nice                                 kind of intermediate layer we're doing                                 this mainly for a couple different                                 clients that are on salesforce and so if                                 we can store stuff in Drupal natively                                 and then we can ship it off the                                 Salesforce we're not quite as reliant on                                 salesforce for authentication and for                                 kind of checking permissions on the fly                                 all the time also one of our                                 distributions that we're working on for                                 foundations right now needs to integrate                                 with two difference here third-party                                 CRMs so having all of those objects                                 natively in Drupal provides a level of                                 abstractions so that we can you know                                 talk to multiple back ends at the same                                 time so Red Hen CRM is a are                                 open source solution it's all up on                                 drupal.org at project red hen and then                                 cool so it looks great with this right                                 up here right now but here's what we                                 have so far so it's still in active                                 development we have if you go to the Red                                 Hen project page there's a link to a                                 demo installation profile that we've                                 built that demos that builds this right                                 here which is just kind of a quick demo                                 of a fictional pet association of pet                                 shelter organizations so a couple things                                 that we're doing here one we have two                                 different entity types one for                                 organizations and one for individuals                                 and then using the entity system you can                                 build your own bundles for each of those                                 types so one thing for example in terms                                 of contacts you know just as kind of an                                 example here we have a staff bundle and                                 then a volunteer bundle and they can                                 have different fields which is kind of                                 nice because different types of contacts                                 that you store data on you might want to                                 store different fields you could also                                 handle that using like conditional                                 fields or something like that if you                                 wanted to have a single bundle and but                                 you know we provide some flexibility                                 around that so there's opportunity to do                                 both then what we're doing and this kind                                 of sets us apart from I should actually                                 mention the two other kind of big                                 efforts that are going on for native CRM                                 and Drupal are the party module which is                                 built on profile too and is kind of the                                 CRM API group on Drupal groups that it's                                 a great effort it's very tied to you                                 from our perspective it's very tied to                                 user accounts and also it's really kind                                 of based around doing a lot more in                                 configuration we're really targeting                                 building solutions a framework that                                 other developers could leverage because                                 we want stuff not to break for our                                 clients once they and we want our system                                 to be extendable so we're doing a lot                                 more in code as I'll kind of show you                                 the other effort that's going on is the                                 trend has serum core                                 we're very similar to CRM core and that                                 they're reliant on custom entity types                                 for organ fur for contacts they actually                                 have one entity type and then they have                                 a bundle for households and a different                                 bundle for organizations and contacts                                 were you know a little bit different in                                 that we have two different entity types                                 for those two things the big difference                                 between what we're doing i think in what                                 serum core is doing is that all of their                                 interfaces are built with views and that                                 is a big plus if you want to pass off a                                 solution and have your customers or site                                 administrators be able to really quickly                                 add fields to layouts and listings that                                 is a con in our opinion if you want to                                 create a really vibrant contributed                                 add-on space because as soon as someone                                 overrides a view if another view through                                 features overrides or whatnot goes in                                 there and adds another column to a                                 tabular listing all that stuff breaks so                                 I don't know how many of you guys have                                 worked with features and have it's                                 really wonderful i'm not sure if any of                                 you kind of banged your head on it but                                 trying to get different views exported                                 stuff to work when you build on top of                                 it gets really kind of fragile really                                 quickly yeah well I mean it does unless                                 the original feature is overridden in                                 the it does if one feature is over I if                                 one codified feature is overriding                                 another codified feature it works great                                 but the whole point of having views is                                 to give your client the ability to                                 override views in the in the database                                 which renders all that stuff moot you                                 know if the goal is actually to write to                                 extend code with code why have that                                 intermediate level of having features                                 and exports at least from our opinion so                                 what we're doing is actually leveraging                                 entity field query so this is a list of                                 contacts that we have right here and                                 we're doing some interesting stuff so                                 right now we have a real basic search                                 this is just some custom code that we've                                 abstracted on top of all of our                                 different listings and what's kind of                                 neat is that we can go in here to these                                 different bundles say staff and then                                 does an AJAX call back to find all the                                 fields that are on that entity                                 type-r that entity bundle to find the                                 unique one so staff I haven't done                                 anything it just has an email field but                                 volunteers I've added a text field for                                 availability and because it's on that                                 bundle it automatically shows up which                                 is really pretty slick if you're going                                 to give your the ability to your site                                 administrators to add fields and all                                 Syrians kind of need to do that but now                                 they don't have to worry about views                                 editing views in order to get that stuff                                 to show up as filter options so I can                                 just type in here mondays not sure if                                 it's a yeah there we go cool so then on                                 our contacts here we have we have                                 summary information we have the we have                                 another custom entity type that lets us                                 create connections same kind of paradigm                                 we have different bundles that a site                                 administrator can build for different                                 types of connections and those different                                 bundles can have their own fields which                                 is pretty slick and that's that's just                                 using the relations module memberships                                 same same paradigm we've got custom a                                 custom entity type called membership                                 that can be extended with its many been                                 bundles as you want so different types                                 of memberships can have different fields                                 available to them as well as the fact                                 that since we're using an nad API module                                 we get the view support and we get the                                 rule support so if you want to do really                                 awesome like provide different discounts                                 through drupal commerce based on                                 membership rules interacting with these                                 membership entities you can do some                                 really complex business logic so for                                 really tight association management                                 features this works really well then one                                 of the things that we have that we're                                 pretty darn stoked on is this concept of                                 engagement scoring so we have an API                                 built that lets you create engagement                                 points for different types of                                 interactions with a site so a real quick                                 kind of example of that is we have a                                 note system and I can add a note for for                                 love here I can choose what type of note                                 and this is using taxonomy so it can be                                 extended really easily I can say that                                 you know i'm taking a note that's                                 reflecting a meeting that we have and                                 then we can get that that note we can                                 track that by giving an engagement score                                 i'm going to say this was a high value                                 engagement                                 and this is all configurable you can                                 create your own types of engagement give                                 them different score scoring algorithms                                 things like that integrate these                                 algorithms with rules if you wanted to                                 down the road we're not doing that yet                                 but we could now I save this note and if                                 i go back to engagement i can see i just                                 gave him                                                               interaction so you can see how this                                 could get really cool with dealing with                                 unauthenticated users you could say if                                 someone leaves in an anonymous blog post                                 comment and they leave an email address                                 go look that email address up against                                 your CRM and score it and and track                                 engagement that way or if you have a                                 Twitter handle in your CRM go out                                 Twitter pull a hashtag or a different                                 Twitter account that you're looking at                                 to see if they're retweeting it give                                 them scores for that so some of that                                 stuff we're going to be building soon                                 it's not all there now but the basic                                 framework is there to extend this in                                 those kind of ways and then finally                                 something that's really important to our                                 users is registrations so we have a                                 module called entity registrations                                 projects name is just registration to                                 make it confusing but this is basically                                 an entity based version of the signup                                 module for Drupal                                                        authenticated and unaffiliated                                 registrations we're integrating it with                                 drupal commerce and the next month as we                                 are integrating our membership with                                 drupal commerce and what that does and                                 again it's really neat because we can                                 key off email addresses if someone goes                                 to your site and registers for an event                                 anonymously but you have your email                                 address and your crm you you can give                                 them discounts on the fly even if                                 they're not logged in as well as track                                 all those anonymous registrations to                                 their account so you're really lowering                                 the barrier for people to engage with                                 you and actually track meaningful data                                 with them you could get pretty big but                                 brother here too you know someone                                 someone makes a comment on your website                                 you know you track you figure out who                                 they are based on their email address                                 and then you can start tracking them on                                 your site through their session ID you                                 know you can start to get some really                                 interesting data there to engage with                                 these folks and again energy                                 registrations just working right with                                 this isn't necessarily part of red hand                                 but you know being able to just make an                                 event open it up for registrations we                                 have the track                                 registrations that registration limits                                 things like that so what we're doing                                 here really i getting i think the real                                 value of having this stuff natively in                                 Drupal is when you want to build these                                 association management tools you know                                 where the integration starts to get                                 really really expensive sometimes cool                                 let me see leb did I miss anything oh                                 cool oh yeah the last thing is that                                 people ask about is how does it                                 integrate with user accounts so we have                                 the scheme in place right now we're                                 going to continue in kind of a                                 contributor but right now what we're                                 doing is that when we save and we have                                 an API for this that we're calling on on                                 energy save here for these contact                                 entities but what i'm doing is i'm going                                 in i'm going to save this this contact                                 record and when i say that we're just                                 going to look up and see if there was a                                 triple user account that has the same                                 email address and then we tagged that                                 user account with it and then we can go                                 in there we're going to keep flushing                                 this out we can go in there and we can                                 actually say well let's not delete that                                 connection but let that's the wrong                                 connection so we can unlink those user                                 accounts and then finally the only other                                 thing that I'll show you real quick and                                 then I'll shut up is working a lot on                                 like the ability to archive contact                                 records as well as to archive                                 organization records archive memberships                                 and things like that the membership                                 management stuff we're going to be                                 continuing to flesh out a lot in the                                 next month because you get into some                                 really crazy business rules we can                                 manage organizational memberships and                                 then we can cascade that two members who                                 are connected to individuals that are                                 connected to those organizations which                                 is really cool and opens up some really                                 neat opportunities to do things like you                                 know apply discounts based on someone's                                 membership if it's a personal membership                                 or if they're associated with an                                 organization that has a membership and                                 things like that so some of that really                                 complex business logic again I think                                 it's pretty difficult to do if you're                                 integrating across third-party CRMs but                                 again we're a little bit biased on that                                 so definitely not a replacement for                                 stuff like Salesforce there's a lot of                                 stuff that you can do in Salesforce in                                 particular and we really recommend it to                                 a lot of our clients that you just you                                 would never be able to do in Drupal you                                 know                                 you know we're not going to integrate                                 Red Hen crm with Outlook or your desktop                                 applications or any of that kind we're                                 not going to integrate with your                                 accounting package Google Apps things                                 like that so you know there's definitely                                 this is one tool in a very large you                                 know toolkit that you need if you really                                 want to get going on this stuff hardcore                                 so we're doing a bop on this tomorrow                                 we'd love to dive in at some code with                                 some folks and kind of work through them                                 some things get some if there's features                                 that folks want to want to see us                                 prioritize or if they want to engage in                                 the community that would be rad we'd                                 love to talk to you about it no I                                 wouldn't say that you know i would i                                 would say that well we've got three                                 clients that are launching on it and                                 within the next two months so we have to                                 be pretty darn close it's kind of a                                 unique model we have like three clients                                 that all invested a collective                                           billable hours under this project so                                 it's really being driven by those needs                                 we can't really fail like it's not                                 really one of those things that as a                                 company we can handle so there's a lot                                 of pressure to get it done and get it                                 done really well the stuff that we have                                 right here works works pretty darn well                                 if you just want to start tracking data                                 the integration with user accounts and                                 the integration with commerce is not                                 there yet but we've got three folks                                 working on this pretty much full-time                                 right now so the developments happening                                 really rapidly no we don't mean it's                                 it's an interesting thing it's a long                                 conversation about a community                                 engagement and we want community                                 engagement but it's it's really hard to                                 kind of be dealing with bug reports that                                 are coming in for because we tagged a                                 release and stuff like that so we're                                 just kind of accounting on folks who can                                 download the code via get engaging at                                 this point and we'll engage with a wider                                 community as soon as things get a little                                 bit further along so                                 Chris                                 musical laptops                                 so I'm going to be talking about our                                 Salesforce integration and touching on                                 our Drupal distribution called                                 springboard if you want to download it                                 and try it out you may go you may do so                                 at go springboard com it's all up on                                 github there's also a drupal.org project                                 page at I think projects / springboard                                 but go springboard com has all kinds of                                 stuff so I'm going to walk through the                                 International Fund for Animal Welfare as                                 an example of how they're integrating                                 with Salesforce on their site pretty                                 unique site multiple currencies multiple                                 languages sites that are regional based                                 so that we have multiple sites with the                                 same language which in Drupal i                                       not great but so we're doing a bunch of                                 things to make that work and so if I go                                 into the u.s. form if I go to a donation                                 form in the u.s. you know i get i get                                 credit card and paypal if i go back to                                 do the UK i get direct debit paypal and                                 credit card and in pounds so you know                                 fairly complex requirements around                                 currency management and languages and it                                 makes for some complex things not in                                 droop not just in drupal but also in                                 salesforce so in salesforce to handle                                 multi-currency you actually have to                                 install you have to get the support                                 people to install multi-currency and                                 enable it for you and all of this stuff                                 happens on the drupal end gets sink down                                 to two sales force through our                                 integration so anything that a user does                                 online whether it's donate or take                                 action all of that is happening in                                 in Drupal and we have a variety of field                                 maps and we go ahead and open up the                                 field map so you can see how this kind                                 of plays out so every all of the                                 donation forms and action forms are                                 actually web forms and all of those                                 submissions are then synced down into a                                 variety of objects so donations go to                                 opportunities web forms go to a custom                                 object called actions so action forms                                 and then we also have user field maps                                 for contacts so if I go in here you can                                 just see how a field map between the two                                 systems works there's the sales force                                 field name here the Drupal field here                                 which you get to pick we have some                                 business rules for how to handle the                                 data going to and from Salesforce so you                                 can choose what if you're going to                                 override it or not override it or only                                 overwrite one blank so all all all of                                 the objects are handled through field                                 maps there's also some hooks for if                                 there's other complicated thing that                                 things that you need to do to extend the                                 integration there's hooks where you can                                 extend those other objects or the data                                 that gets passed or you can have rules                                 and when the system collects all this                                 stuff on cron it will match up all this                                 stuff put it in a queue and sink it down                                 and so we have a variety of let me just                                 bring up some of the key reports so how                                 many of you are actually use Salesforce                                 Salesforce people and have you hit your                                 API limits ever integrating the                                 Salesforce yes so that's because if you                                 just sink if you do a lot of volume and                                 this is I thought I don't do a ton but                                 they do enough that when they do an                                 action they could definitely go over                                 their API limits so what we do is we                                 batch up all of the like items put them                                 in a batch                                 and then we sink it down and then we                                 have this report where you can tell when                                 when the synced happened how many how                                 many items were a success or failure and                                 then you can actually click through so                                 if there was a failure in here I could                                 find it and I could fix it and it gives                                 you all the details of what was sent                                 down to Salesforce we also have a                                 retrack you so if something does fail                                 you can go in here it will wait a day                                 and then retry it it assumes that it                                 failed for any one of a number of                                 reasons there could be bad data that                                 needs to be addressed in the record if                                 sales force goes into maintenance mode                                 and sales forces down then you're not                                 going to be able to sync up with it                                 there could be network connection loss                                 so we want to make sure that that data                                 gets captured and then synced when we're                                 able to sync it if I do nothing this                                 will all get synced based on this retry                                  date or I can wreak you it now I'll just                                  click on my little retrying and i'm                                  unable to excellent perfect and then                                  finally we have a permanent failure so                                  if it retries three times and then it                                  can't sink it then we stick it in this                                  permanent failure queue and you can bulk                                  retry all of them in the queue or                                  manually retry them then there's a few                                  other things that we have baked in so if                                  you there's some rules integration on                                  the integration itself so based on                                  whether something has happened so in                                  this case if an object fails to export                                  to Salesforce we have a rule that will                                  fix the last name so in Salesforce last                                  name field is required on the contact                                  object so if you have users that join                                  your site and they don't put a last name                                  in it's going to fail on the sink and we                                  actually have a rule to handle that most                                  of the forms will require it but if the                                  client decides to create a form without                                  last name they just have email address                                  on it we've created this rule here                                  that if it if it fails to export and the                                  last name field is blank and it's a user                                  and then we go in and we update the                                  field and then we add it back into the                                  queue so it kind of automatically                                  handles automatically handles data issue                                  or common data issues and it's totally                                  configurable so not every organization                                  has the same problems so you can                                  configure these based on how your sink                                  what you learn from your sink as you go                                  what else should I talk about                                  integration wise oh yeah we can go into                                  a web form sure so so this you know so                                  our integration is a little bit                                  different than what's on contribs web                                  form integration and part of what makes                                  it awesome is we go here so this is                                  actually a donation forms I'm actually a                                  good example but in donations you can                                  map all of the fields from the form and                                  we we preset these fields to so the maps                                  are already built when you create the                                  donation form but you can map any any                                  field on the web form to the Salesforce                                  opportunity and so if you create custom                                  fields on your donation forms you can                                  either map them to the opportunity                                  record or you can map them to the user                                  so if you add a how did you hear about                                  us field that would go on your user                                  profile if you added a you know what                                  t-shirt size do you want or do you want                                  a gift field that would go on the on                                  this side and so there's field maps on                                  web forms field maps on donation forms                                  and they're a little bit different we                                  just go back to                                  here we go so this is a petition form                                  for the Netherlands so and it's in Dutch                                  which is going to make this really                                  awesome so there's a couple things that                                  you can do with web forms one thing is                                  that you are able to so these aren't                                  even getting synced so I can choose my                                  Salesforce object that I want to sink to                                  and then it gives me all of the fields                                  and then I can select the the fields                                  that I want to sink down you also get                                  things like the node ID the no title you                                  can sink down the submission ID and the                                  submission date which is also very                                  helpful when you're getting website web                                  form data damn do you want to know when                                  they filled out the form so it exposes                                  all of the form fields as well as                                  metadata about the submission and the                                  note itself                                  let's go in the spring                                  so Salesforce sells forces API is a                                  soap-based API so you need to upload a                                  wisdom that describes all the objects                                  there's a handy dandy place to do that                                  you can also set the cue processor order                                  in which the object gets synced down you                                  can also set batch sizes and things like                                  that so it's fairly configurable and I                                  think that's probably yeah about it so                                  why don't we just real quick                                  I don't think we hit                                  let's show the kitty all right does                                  anyone have any questions yeah step up                                  to the mic my man so like I mentioned                                  earlier on we're using razor's edge and                                  it's a whole mess that it has to go                                  through net community so our website is                                  Drupal and when you want to donate we                                  have to forward you to a one page                                  donation form that's on net community                                  well now we want the two to talk to each                                  other which by the sounds of it is not                                  really possible well so Drupal to talk                                  to razor's edge or well yeah I suppose                                  Drupal to talk to razor's edge and then                                  raises it to talk back to it I mean I've                                  tried to be a bit of research on this                                  but I mean seeing as how that kind of                                  falls under your everybody everybody                                  that deals with blackboard x yeah so                                  what would your suggestion be if you're                                  on one of these CRMs that just seem to                                  fall on that list oh yeah now we run                                  into this lot and my suggestion honestly                                  is to use Salesforce as kind of the                                  intermediary step because then you can                                  integrate Salesforce to razor's edge                                  which would be a much easier task than                                  trying to integrate your Drupal site                                  into your razors edge system and do you                                  know what it's like migrating your data                                  from razor's edge to Salesforce oh I                                  think you can keep they can live they                                  can peacefully coexist so I'm saying you                                  would see you keep razor's edge as donor                                  management have Salesforce running as                                  just your e CRM platform you could send                                  emails from there you could do a bunch                                  of things on that piece and there's lots                                  of options for integrating Salesforce                                  and razors edge whether that's you know                                  whether you do it with like an ETL tool                                  or whether you're doing like file-based                                  loads with just something like data                                  loader there's lots of options available                                  in that in that space so would                                  Salesforce kind of take the place of net                                  community yes and that Salesforce in                                  Drupal would take the place of net                                  community a Drupal would take the front                                  end place Salesforce would take just the                                  data storage                                  that segmentation place yeah okay great                                  thanks a lot yeah one of the recurring                                  headaches that we run into is contact                                  merges and people create multiple users                                  and when you start looking at the sinks                                  obviously sinking inserts updates                                  deletes the basic operations seem pretty                                  straightforward do any of these anchor                                  integrations or sinks do a good job of                                  dealing with contact merges yeah so for                                  so the for the whether you're using the                                  contribs a lure springboard we we sink                                  on the contribu contribu in spring board                                  we sink down we have a dee doop key and                                  you can set it on a field map so for                                  contacts it's almost always email but a                                  user can go in and add another another                                  contact with that same email into                                  salesforce and now you have your                                  duplicate so what happens on our end is                                  we we put a trigger in in sales force to                                  prevent that so we have an apex trigger                                  that we use that will prevent duplicate                                  contacts from getting created if they do                                  get created there's lots of merge tools                                  you can use you can either use regular                                  salesforce native marriage crm fusion if                                  your salesforce user they give that                                  stuff away to nonprofits and that's                                  really powerful tools especially for                                  things like d duping emerge once you've                                  merged your record on the salesforce                                  side depending on whether which one was                                  the keep record you might also need to                                  clean out the drupal side so we have a                                  utility that allows you to kind of clear                                  out the Salesforce data on a user or on                                  a batch of users and I think for other                                  systems you know it's going to depend on                                  how that system works you know at least                                  in Drupal you can always rely on the                                  fact that users are unique on email so                                  you know that your starting point is                                  going to be unique on email so with                                  Salesforce you dee doop on sales for                                  first and then kind of wiping them out                                  entirely on Drupal and read and then                                  racing yeah you you break the connection                                  in Drupal minute and then it gets Reese                                  inked and merges into that that existing                                  record yeah we call it wipe which is                                  kind of gross I came in a little bit                                  late miss the salsa part of the                                  presentation but just wanted to let                                  everyone know that the dormant salsa API                                  and salsa supporters modules are under                                  development again and there is some                                  early code in the                                                       both and we've got two sites going live                                  in the next month so there should be                                  some much later code being posted in the                                  next couple of weeks and salsa                                  supporters specifically will now sync to                                  profile to profiles and the ultimate                                  goal is to have any salsa object                                  synchronized to any drupal entity                                  awesome awesome that's great those I am                                  looking for collaborators bear here in                                  Switzerland and I are working on salsa                                  API but looking for of other                                  collaborators and other use cases to to                                  work on so are you are you working with                                  anyone at salsa as well yes we're                                  working with salsa laps we are based in                                  Washington DC so we talked to them on a                                  regular basis awesome and do you know                                  what the difference is between those                                  modules and the salsa integration module                                  I know that the salsa integration module                                  kind of sort of works I think there were                                  some changes tell salsas API that broke                                  some things and they don't this is the                                  trailer module yeah yeah I don't really                                  know much about what the current status                                  of that module is I know that the person                                  who created that module for Ellen is no                                  longer with felon so                                  I I think that they are more focused on                                  crm core at this point yep okay cool                                  that's great news thanks for the that's                                  good update well around the subject we                                  have revived also the net forum views of                                  a deprecated net forum views integration                                  as part of a project that was basically                                  a work-for-hire for a Vectra and right                                  now it's not on drupal.org but we're                                  working with the vector to hopefully                                  bring that to light it actually is a                                  views three query plug-in that allows                                  the vectra's x web api to be a data                                  source under views so you can just spot                                  build dynamic queries from from the net                                  forum product so hopefully that will be                                  around pretty soon we're we're trying to                                  convince the folks at a vector that's                                  great idea to get it out there in the                                  community yeah now that's that's how                                  that's a great thing and a great use of                                  use                                                                    different data sources any other                                  questions comments we're out of beer on                                  people left                                  I think I think we're at we're at the
