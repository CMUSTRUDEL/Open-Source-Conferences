Description: 
	CONNECTING THE DOTS FOR PORTFOLIO, SNOWMAN & BUTLER

We all acknowledge the still growing complexity. A one-shot, generic and unassuming install will not provide a useful onramp experience for anyone. We have to think in multiples here and define explicit, narrow use cases to help people wrap their heads around the awesome. And a couple of them are out there already. Let me show you them.

Lets have a quick update on where we are in making Drupal 8 the most powerful and easiest to use version of Drupal, ever. We'll establish the playing field by a quick rundown of two main D8UX topics and see how we can apply these to help tackle a third:

BUILDER UX

We're working to improve the site builder tools like modules page, field ui and the everything-is-a-block page builder tool that is part of WSCCI.

EDITOR UX

As clunky as the site builder tools may be, we provide even sparser options for people that work in Drupal sites to get the word out. Yet, making it easy for folk to actually create some content is about as core a feature can get. Let's see how we're doing there.

The total of how we pre-configure these two sets of tools is what to a large extent will define the core Product.

If community driven product development is not your thing, I still hope to show you how vital it is to dedicate time and effort on having this playground in core, right now. And ship the funnest parts of it with Drupal 8.

No cat pictures but I will sneak in some art history.

	                              all right let's do it yeah the title was                               three is the magic number one of the                               goals of the usability team is to                               provide a Drupal                                                   specific initial experience something a                               bit more coherent that is a bit more                               clear about what you can actually do                               with it and I have three general ideas                               how about how we can achieve them first                                of all volcanoes sucked I had a                                conversation basically around this topic                                for San Francisco Iceland got in a way I                                want to do that these slides as an                                introduction that once more I didn't                                over skype I think that was the first                                car conversation San Francisco even know                                yet gorgeous um yeah so there was a                                strict format for how to define your                                proposal for slides the context was                                Drupal can do everything there's always                                a module for that we are good at                                promising everything right core there's                                nothing almost nothing really well the                                default install profile sucks it                                provides the framework first features                                are generic or incomplete and core can't                                target a specific use case and this is                                all mostly by design around that the                                product versus framework debate was well                                underway actually and this was just my                                attempt of trying to show you that I                                kind of understood what the underlying                                concepts were that there was a car with                                a framework and the concept space that                                lets you collect and assemble all the                                things together into your specific                                awesome applique                                there were some good blog posts around                                the time right now I liked it so my                                vision den was yes we need to provide                                core provide core with a couple of ideas                                of stop applications No last year we                                talked about this as getting you to the                                sixty percent use case so that you be                                invested you'd have something up and                                running it would get you invested and                                would compel you to look further and                                dive into country and start to find the                                right module that would get you further                                so maybe the Installer would have a some                                kind of pull down and have some tea                                merrick fiend size for you available                                with specific configuration and maybe a                                different no type etc or the shortcut to                                know thanks I just need the framework                                and I'm gonna do my own thing ck revived                                by Cupid's kiss like a nova it's in the                                Louvre in Paris last year Jesus keynote                                mentioned that Drupal using Drupal                                applications should be a delightful                                experience if you've ever seen it it's                                it's it's marble but it's so tender so                                delicate it's pretty quite amazing to                                see another heuristic that dress                                provided was for Drupal                                           provide newbies primarily and experts                                secondary a good initial experience                                that's what we're talking about right on                                ramp providing on ramp well we can check                                how Drupal performs doing that now and                                we did we saw that earlier today                                is that delightful nope this is the                                Lancome group this is from                                             it's a trojan priest Clio Kony and his                                sons being strangled by sea serpents and                                if you look if you see this statute is                                really in pain I promised I would sneak                                in some art history earlier today we saw                                a good summary of the the last Google                                usability test that was performed and                                just yesterday a good high level                                overview of the main problems that are                                in this install are in this experience                                are summarized as many problems on                                conceptual level problems on flow                                getting people from one step to the next                                step terminology that's the most                                pervasive one we've always seen                                throughout all usability tests and just                                clunky interfaces so to me this balls                                down that the blank canvas that we                                provide right now is not helpful to                                people anymore it used to be because                                prior to Drupal                                                   mostly developers tool for developers so                                what you would get put map to what the                                people that were going to use it think                                about stuff that's not really the case                                anymore                                 so how are we going to achieve this                                 provide a more targeted more specific                                 initial experience one of the things we                                 try to do in defining a usability gate                                 was to define for ourselves some driving                                 principles I mean we have a usability                                 test that give us real data on what we                                 on what is wrong what we should be fixed                                 and then there's other user problems or                                 issues or things you want to improve                                 that don't really have a perfect answer                                 we're always making trade-offs and then                                 you can rely on design principles and                                 choose a few that can support you and                                 help inform the design decisions we need                                 to be making sorry so the one the first                                 one would be easy first and powerful on                                 a do it right now everything is there                                 all at once maybe we should narrow that                                 down and let people discover the more                                 advanced stuff later connect the dots is                                 another one in the sense that we should                                 provide more specific workflows for                                 people getting you from the one step to                                 the next step but then for whom are we                                 connecting which does that still the                                 question but currently the UI is                                 fragmented it's unweighted is little                                 hierarchy to it and there's no real                                 visual mechanism to denote important                                 stuff from less important stuff so it                                 will be hard for people to connect at us                                 this helps in connecting the dots it has                                 some parts filled in it empowers you                                 because you know what you'll be getting                                 and this looks achievable and                                 I mean this is a children's thing but                                 there's there's quite a few concepts in                                 here already it has a clear task and                                 some parts are already filled in so you                                 already get a sense of what you where                                 you'll be heading and I mean even that                                 little cactus in the background it gives                                 you perspective what's important what's                                 not so connected us the main questions                                 then is for whom are we connecting the                                 dots for which use case for which role                                 are we providing that unwrapped we want                                 to be as specific as possible here but                                 that's always a challenge but core right                                 so to help start framing this I've been                                 thinking around three high-level use                                 cases that we can explore and define a                                 deep yeah explore so I do it a lot and                                 these are small little doodles and                                 there's a lot of condensed thinking in                                 there in a way my three use cases were                                 okay just the single individual use case                                 I mean it's baked into you human nature                                 to think me me me first it's as it is                                 yeah we all know designers are the most                                 egocentric of all so maybe we could do                                 something for solo designers of visual                                 or and provide them with a mechanism                                 that helps them get their stuff out                                 maybe a portfolio the second one was us                                 a group of people collect it would wear                                 the designer the design use case would                                 also target mode editorial the editor UX                                 the US is a small group of people this                                 is snowman right                                 if you've heard that before small group                                 of people collective they want to build                                 something and work together on something                                 online and then there's most of you here                                 the developers who are the most                                 philosophical and philanthropic of all                                 and but only that to achieve world                                 domination right no no limits I also                                 call it anything scenario I mean no                                 holds barred and this is where the                                 abstract and the flexibility comes from                                 let's look at e                                                       detail so to me use case me me me and                                 could be a portfolio thing son still                                 smoking he actually took on this and                                 even started a project for it and the                                 idea is here why not provide people with                                 a starting point to get their own work                                 out there a professional portfolio maybe                                 for a freelancer and we did some work on                                 it actually in the Berlin design camp                                 last year we did a brainstorm and it and                                 there the starting point was okay maybe                                 even mobile portfolio may be silly but                                 and really it has a quite simple a                                 couple of quite simple requirements the                                 main object would be for you to get to                                 show your stuff and to allow other                                 people to contact you don't people known                                 usually people say that you can do                                 anything collectively the core I                                 disagree so I have a personal example I                                 make etchings monotypes try to get my                                 hands dirty sometimes instead of typing                                 on keyboards and stuff and drama drawing                                 up wireframes this is a sub-theme of                                 seven                                 this is                                                                 your presentation it's even I could                                 share it later I mean this                                              CSS in a sub-theme for for the most part                                 and otherwise it's just ripple core and                                 that                                                                     I can resize and the concert will reflow                                 core only and there's a little food that                                 says contact me if you want to know more                                 use case cover did I throw out the true                                 at                                                                     group of people collaborating on a                                 project want to tell the world about it                                 and convince others to join in and the                                 Snowman a use case has been the most                                 talked about it and it hits squarely had                                 where drupal comes from I'm in Drupal                                 drupal was that project itself it just                                 grew out to be due to the world                                 domination scenario but in the sense and                                 there's a lot to learn from the lessons                                 from tupelo                                                            doing a couple of years ago there's a                                 tiki know there's a scheduler module in                                 Drupal                                                                  I want to this to plug published in nice                                 so the studio where I do this do the                                 printing is exactly that group of people                                 they need to present their facilities to                                 the outside world and there's like                                                                                                           communicate privately as well to help                                 organize the next exposition the next                                 exhibit again the core only side it                                 works quite well so I think it can be                                 done I mean you're hit limits pretty                                 soon and I mean like we are all here are                                 experts in Drupal so I know which ones                                 which were a little bits to apply to                                 make it work but you can do                                 yeah I need help further for the world                                 domination use case this would be a                                 developer specific thing i would like to                                 repurpose the butter working title RT mg                                 of course yeah i mean we don't have a                                 mission low side of the fact that we're                                 all who were experts in all things                                 through paul we want to attract smart                                 developers were not experienced with                                 your call so what can we give them                                 besides just a code base it'll have                                 helped them get up to speed I mean                                 Drupal                                                              phone for them fabulous new architecture                                 and really sharp generic api's but what                                 reach out can we do for them to help                                 them wrap their heads around the awesome                                 right cuz that's the goal how do you                                 help you but what stuck out for me is a                                 the SDKs that dreams mentions in his                                 keynote maybe something like that I hear                                 people when they when I overhear                                 discussions are a lot of yeah I just put                                 on GSM just to follow where everything's                                 gone from maybe maybe we can do a little                                 tool for that maybe I don't know three                                 years cases for me for us as a group and                                 for the world and of course they would                                 feed there would be a layer on top of                                 each other what we do right for the me                                 use case would help the feature set for                                 the for the US use case as well and                                 maybe even though the generic are the                                 world domination scheme                                 let's do it jeez proposing is a key note                                 that we even have a design process but                                 some clearly marked phases before we hit                                 the feature freeze I put in a                                 compilation number start now for the                                 stuff I think that we should be working                                 on for portfolio son has been working on                                 and we have been working on a good big                                 spreadsheet which goes beyond that one                                 portfolio for a visual person but has a                                 lot of use cases for any other type of                                 individual individual that might want to                                 achieve the same thing present                                 themselves professionally snowman has a                                 couple private forums is one like I                                 mentioned in the in my use case where we                                 would like to discuss privately about                                 the next exhibit that we are organizing                                 and for Butler I write once a once the                                 other idea had there was called tissues                                 that would be some kind of issue tracker                                 RSS feed like issue tracker maybe a                                 mobile app that could pull in your                                 issues and you could see three updates                                 and tune it updates so I tried to put I                                 mean aggregator Kemp bully in front as a                                 suite of my issues that's where it                                 stopped because it's not action but one                                 show three new or two updates here or                                 there but something like that you know                                 something that combines the new services                                 that will be available and if we use                                 that example as use your issue tracker                                 have a hook into contributing so maybe                                 that's where we might end up for core                                 chuja drupal that's a big vision                                 document that the Sun put out as well I                                 think that's a it's a useful framework                                 to start exploring still we are still                                 have a bit of time to explore this and                                 we need more options and then do the                                 analysis and really focus on what we                                 have to put in there                                 to make it work and we should I think we                                 should go for that thanks couple of                                 links that's it any questions cool yep                                 ddddd it's a way to fast forward Larry                                 shoot so while you're scaling through                                 that first of all plus one I love this                                 plan my question is between this kind of                                 developer oriented Butler installed                                 profile and just the code what do you                                 see the difference being there because                                 if you want to use Drupal as a                                 development framework e type thing isn't                                 just the code what you would want what                                 would be the difference between those                                 two options besides just installing car                                 and what would be the extra layer for                                 people yeah the unwound there I don't                                 I'm not really sure I'm thinking example                                 code i'm thinking i mean i think i                                 remember that you once pointed out that                                 some java thing had the pet shop example                                 i come again if i don't know if you                                 mentioned it once that some kind of java                                 development environment provided                                 developers with a prototype that was a                                 pet shop you could buy pets maybe I                                 messed up mix that up maybe it sounds                                 similar to like the Northwind database                                 that Microsoft database products have                                 included forever okay I don't know so I                                 mean but yeah I'm looking for ideas I                                 don't know what developers specifically                                 run into and what is there what are                                 their problems in cracking Drupal so I'm                                 looking for ideas do you have values I'm                                 not sure I'd have to think about it it                                 is your idea that you know Drupal                                 professionals who build sites and know                                 what they're doing and just want to jump                                 in and build their client site which of                                 those do you see them using all right                                 hopefully yeah the idea would be to have                                 that third one specifically target two                                 people and to help developers get up to                                 speed around Drupal concepts that maybe                                 I mean I'm guessing that would be less                                 about DUI getting around the UI and                                 getting stuff that stuff done and more                                 about the underlying code and I know who                                 okay i'm not sure what the lanes but                                 yeah sounds interesting i like i like                                 this idea a lot and I it almost seems                                 like it would make sense to have three                                 kind of installed profiles like that but                                 have them be one some and all or                                 something like that and the all wouldn't                                 necessarily be it would be different                                 from what from what you're saying about                                 the developer but more be like for a                                 forum or some some kind of site that                                 wants to involve anyone and everyone and                                 then the middle one the sum would be for                                 like a group or organization like like a                                 company so it could it could have                                 something to do with what how many roles                                 you start with as the as the base how                                 many content types yeah yeah yeah I mean                                 um I I foetus to subscribe to this whole                                 framework idea and I think this is how                                 you prove that you're being a framework                                 I really like this idea and i love the                                 slides but besides that so can you tell                                 me more about the research which you did                                 because i'm kind of stuck with the word                                 portfolio because that i know this is                                 just you know discussion phase so it                                 would be really helpful for at least me                                 probably some other people if you could                                 tell what came from the research as to                                 what what constitutes portfolio                                 specifically in terms of the need                                 because it could be like I don't know                                 just I just want to blog and the reason                                 this I'm asking is what we've done in                                 Drupal Gardens is that we have this kind                                 of different templates that we call and                                 we put like blog template and work                                 template or something like that and                                 that's probably what there is some                                 overlap so it would be really                                 interesting to know what came from the                                 research this little research here this                                 is something me thinking of stuff but                                 one of the other by lines for this                                 portfolio                                 idea was it is not a blog because why                                 would we want to compete with WordPress                                 and tumblers and all day so I'm thinking                                 from my accout iskele designer point of                                 view that this that specific use case                                 would also be a good showcase for the                                 media module like where we show up how                                 awesome it is to now in bad movies                                 slideshows and images into your content                                 but then wouldn't that mean that we are                                 encouraging people to not use Drupal for                                 the idea is that we have to make the                                 initial experience better for new users                                 a lot of people are just blogging and                                 doing simple things and and if we are                                 saying portfolio so do we want to have                                 it only portfolio kind of websites on                                 Drupal isn't that yeah I mean blogging a                                 blog is of course a perfect example for                                 a single person's use case yes I try to                                 think around it a bit because it's                                 pretty generic I mean we can end up                                 there many of the ideas quickly hit that                                 it would have a new section or a blog or                                 some stream of updates orders Chronicle                                 chronologically so I don't think blog is                                 out of the question I just want just                                 don't want to focus on that right now                                 because I want to find ideas that are a                                 bit more original or a bit more specific                                 than that yeah yeah thanks for the                                 presentation Roy is really cool I guess                                 very similar what I'm thinking is we if                                 if you sort of have three pretty                                 established paths for someone when they                                 are like thinking about if they want to                                 use Drupal or not if there is a problem                                 there where you'd be perhaps ostracizing                                 users who you know I don't want a                                 portfolio I want my school newspaper                                 website to be an Drupal and then I had                                 another question I guess you can answer                                 that for us because I forgot the other                                 one I mean just is there any thought                                 there about you know are we going to be                                 sending messages to people that I mean                                 basically what you're saying that the                                 one way to do it is is really the                                 establish where the other ways or not is                                 yeah CheY I mean that's that will be the                                 tough thing to balance our specific will                                 be being how specifically will                                 communicate about what this can do for                                 you I don't know we all have to find out                                 I'd like to have very specific ideas                                 first so that we can maybe derive the                                 generic underlying stuff from that and                                 that's what gets in core I actually when                                 I saw your a demo of how would he call                                 it a date thing sorry the up yeah the                                 onboarding up to speed yeah the                                 onboarding experience which was product                                 agnostic right it just helped explain                                 core concepts I was I was always gonna                                 say yeah that's maybe a better idea I                                 think that that is a lot of useful day                                 yeah I mean sample content just have one                                 note in there somewhere that you can                                 unpublish and edit and move around yeah                                 yeah yeah and I think I think with                                 enough research and with surveying of                                 new users maybe you can bring it down to                                 you know three really good use cases                                 that people are going to mostly want I                                 mean I know when we surveyed people for                                 for the google thing the people that                                 were trying the websites they really                                 wanted to build we had like a newspaper                                 website we had a blog and I think we did                                 have a portfolio example so maybe                                 getting more research on that can help                                 you know these are yeah I mean what we                                 see now that the absolute generic discs                                 that we present now doesn't really help                                 anybody great so and we're going by                                 choosing we're always leaving others                                 behind yeah and that would be new for                                 core to do I don't know if I mean                                 there's all these new packaging                                 awesomeness that's a that's released                                 right now I don't know if we can do a                                 core plus where we provide people with                                 the options that okay if you want to do                                 this then let us fetch this this extra                                 modular set it up for you cool thanks                                 good                                 hey Roy hi so I really liked your                                 presentation and I obviously I really                                 agree with what you say about trying to                                 please everyone means you and are                                 pleasing no one and Drupal is probably                                 why I think probably has a broadest                                 target audience of any product i've seen                                 so I like this move towards installation                                 profiles but I've been thinking recently                                 that the word installation profiles but                                 we doesn't mean anything to a non                                 technical user or someone who's new to                                 Drupal yeah so do you think is worth                                 thinking about this time changing the                                 name of installation profiles design                                 there's more meaningful to add non                                 technical user depends on the you                                 depends on the target audience I think                                 and the people who have to make it work                                 are pretty much used to install profile                                 words because that's what they came up                                 with it and I mean India in that you I                                 if there would be select list where you                                 can choose a different side recipes                                 maybe like we discussed that I think                                 that word should not be there at that                                 place and product and could be an                                 application could be a good good example                                 or maybe recipe yeah I don't think we                                 should present people who are going to                                 check out Drupal with a selection of                                 install profiles well I mean like if you                                 asked your mother what an installation                                 profile was you probably won't be here                                 to tell you right yeah ok thanks wording                                 is important echa to both of those                                 points one idea about Becky's question                                 about like I don't want a portfolio I                                 don't want a group site and I'm not a                                 developer so yo press is you know how                                 you had an option there for like no just                                 give me the code you could also an                                 option there's like show me some other                                 options or something click and that                                 takes you to the distribution listing on                                 drupal.org that's our point about the                                 name installation profiles in November I                                 destroyed a good chunk of my soul trying                                 to do this work on the distributions                                 stuff so I have led a bike shed                                 discussion about what we should rename                                 installation profiles to thinking                                 product or app or something like that                                 might work                                 more sense to people but a consensus I                                 was able to build was essentially and                                 this isn't universal consensus but this                                 was the best I was able to do so                                 somebody else wants to take it on after                                 me that's fine but is basically that                                 installation profile should only be the                                 name of the actual code in the profiles                                 directory so that thing that developers                                 write is called an installation profile                                 yeah the distribution should be the name                                 of any kind of collection of code that's                                 like one or more installation profiles                                 and on drupal.org we should call it                                 distributions everywhere and I don't                                 like the word distribution because I                                 think that doesn't make sense to normal                                 people but I wasn't able to build                                 consensus on any other term that people                                 like better problem is like product                                 implies commercialism yeah app implies                                 something way more limited than a                                 distribution so you know I wasn't able                                 to come up to that consensus but I'm                                 currently working on a on a listing like                                 basically a bunch of just little                                 cosmetic tweaks basically to drupal.org                                 to just make distributions more front                                 and center so like adding the option to                                 either download core or a distribution                                 anywhere that we offer that button and                                 then like making it a top-level thing                                 that kind of stuff so if anybody wants                                 to help me on that that'd be great                                 because I'm pretty much ready to be I'm                                 sick of that issue and if                                 anybody wants to help me just bang it                                 out on Friday that'd be great so it's                                 good you have such a big souls so to                                 your point about you know let's not I                                 don't want to heart too much about the                                 word installation profiles and I agree                                 that it's not a common term shouldn't                                 have been five years later we are                                 discussing the same problem we have with                                 the word modules there are certain ways                                 in which we can find out what people                                 normally think about how they see                                 installation profiles and I may be able                                 to help you with that so we could do                                 some research with people and should not                                 be a big extensive project I also think                                 this looks really cool one question just                                 just make sure my understanding it                                 correctly so these are like different                                 these are basically just different                                 styles of distributions that people will                                 download they're not things to be                                 configured after you download correct                                 the way I understand that if by choosing                                 one of these options                                 then the installation process continues                                 and sets up what's in that shopping list                                 for what's in the distribution of in the                                 installation profile so the installation                                 profile contains the kind of content                                 types you'll get maybe that sample                                 content etc all right yeah i mean i                                 think that sounds good i think that                                 there could be some really i mean i                                 think that the idea of having portfolio                                 and a few other you know like a                                 newspaper or something like that very                                 easily relatable um metaphors I guess                                 the people can can latch onto is really                                 cool but I think I guess another problem                                 that presents is like if you want a                                 website that has the same tendencies as                                 a newspaper the same style of structure                                 but just different names it's really                                 like once you like it's hard for users                                 to make that leap I guess just say oh                                 yes inception organized like a newspaper                                 but I don't understand that in the                                 football team Yeah Yeah Yeah right right                                 and so um there might even be a cool                                 application for some kind of interaction                                 Oh interactive like what do you actually                                 want to do with your thing like a little                                 widget kind of things that like can                                 custom-build I mean something that's not                                 complicated that's not overwhelming at                                 all but it's like yeah what are you                                 looking to do with your site something                                 more than like a B or C it like actually                                 ask you a few questions and based on the                                 interaction of those and that wouldn't                                 have to be in court at would be on                                 drupal.org yeah I might go and like that                                 it can be that even could be Judah I                                 mean that would even be a really cool                                 way to discover distributions um if it's                                 like look maybe you want to download a                                 flavor of Drupal that suits your needs                                 so you don't have to do a ton of                                 customization some kind of like                                 easy-to-use widget teeth this and I mean                                 this this is me and being presented as                                 ideas that would all be in core and                                 there's a lot of things we can do before                                 you install before you download right                                 yeah so we should definitely take that                                 into account yeah right yeah so I hate                                 to be the one to bring up this issue but                                 has it been observed before Drupal core                                 as it is now it's really hard to build                                 anything useful with and you know with                                 any of these things we would have to                                 either make them very very simple                                 put more stuff into core as in modules                                 just throw into core or figure out some                                 way to make these things technically                                 separate from Drupal core itself and                                 modifiable layers we can make them                                 actually packaged on the fly                                 distributions or something I don't know                                 which of those is least hard to do but                                 it's something that we need to be                                 thinking about as well for all of these                                 because you know throwing views into                                 core is not something we're really                                 looking at right now or should we but                                 that means we have to think through a                                 lot of what can we get done with these                                 others and I know when eaten was talking                                 about a snowman originally one of the                                 points he raised which i think is a very                                 good one is that if you you know if you                                 need to do custom code for X that means                                 the framework has to improve so that                                 custom code is just a button or is just                                 uh just a button or something like that                                 he was working at one point on taking                                 like the node front page and some of the                                 other default listings things and rip                                 those out of the existing modules and                                 put them into a list module that is just                                 those exact same things but you can                                 dance                                                                   yeah i think we need it um so you know                                 if we if we do this and I think we                                 should there will be a lot of feedback                                 to wear that application versus                                 framework line is and so I actually                                 think we should be doing this sooner                                 rather than later as we're busy working                                 on the framework yes I'm working on I                                 just like we should be mindful of what                                 can we actually do with the code that                                 actually is in core or what Lupo can be                                 fine for that I think this comes this                                 kind of relates to Howard Reese has been                                 describing that we have to make or                                 bigger and smaller smaller in the sense                                 that more even more decoupled even more                                 abstracted etc but chuck in a couple                                 more features so on Larry's point maybe                                 the way to make more options available                                 for end users while not making call                                 bigger is getting to the meter get menta                                 made a decision before they download                                 Drupal just instead point them towards                                 distributions or installation                                 profiles yes instead of putting a lot                                 more stuff into cool yes I think that's                                 well so it's suggested right there as                                 well that sorry yeah garrus with the                                 interview right the interview of what                                 would you like to do could be handled                                 before yeah so yeah that would should                                 definitely be part of this yeah so kind                                 of along that same line as what he was                                 just saying I'm kind of envisioning sort                                 of what angie was saying where you have                                 in the Drupal installation you can click                                 or choose another option sort of to get                                 a list of distributions and this is just                                 an idea but and I don't know how                                 feasible it is I know in Drupal                                       know you can set up like auto downloads                                 of modules for upgrading possibly some                                 way of setting up the distribution                                 system so you don't actually have to                                 download a separate distribution you can                                 do it right from the installation itself                                 it would require internet access                                 obviously and some other things like                                 that but yeah I mean I like the ideas I                                 can't help really i'll make it a reality                                 but yes I think that's a big part of                                 division right we would be able to do                                 that um Roy this raises lots of                                 questions so yeah you know how attached                                 are you to three I know it's cold about                                 three yes is keeping it team three or                                 more I missed that part of the young so                                 so it is                                                                really three it's three or more no dad                                 does the suggestion was made that well                                 that's his fourth link that no just give                                 me the code or maybe it does it would be                                 an excellent like show me all the other                                 options that answer so it yeah no I just                                 wanted to verify that before okay going                                 on                                 it does remind me a lot i was mentioning                                 to larry yesterday about a product that                                 i designed some time ago back in the                                     it wasn't where it was the desktop thing                                 and it worked out really well basically                                 the idea i was working at carell at the                                 time and the idea was to provide the                                 power of coreldraw look like open new                                 history books if you don't know those                                 with the easy bit closer to the mic oh                                 okay with the ease of use of a wizard                                 that was the challenge the UI design                                 challenge so what what I designed                                 basically was it started off as a wizard                                 and it's basically it's not an install                                 it's a creation process by the way ng                                 one possible alternative to distribution                                 profiling is a site creation strategy I                                 just just mention it just mentioning it                                 but it seems to me like that's what                                 we're done by the time had site creation                                 strategies here and in the case of this                                 product called print house it was about                                 some sort of document creation strategy                                 it started off as a wizard it would ask                                 you questions like what do you want to                                 build a newsletter a greeting card a                                 poster and you would make very high                                 level decisions it would take you to the                                 next step you would come out with a                                 wizard with the product but then it                                 would take you to an interesting magical                                 place that wizard went of wizard is                                 basically a tunnel and you go through                                 and you come out the other end at the                                 other end you have something it looked a                                 bit more like corel draw that would be                                 like there's your surface for drawing                                 things there's the thing you built                                 there's a set of tools but there was                                 also what I called an open-faced wizard                                 which was basically a state sensitive                                 help system that would ask you questions                                 I think Darren was saying things like                                 what do you want to do next and it was                                 still high level it would say things                                 like I want to change something I want                                 to print this I want to save this                                 whatever and then you would drill down                                 through that I want to change something                                 what do you want to change one change                                 the size of something too                                 to add it something and it would                                 literally take control of the tool set                                 the toolbox and guide you with words to                                 using the tool and to the point where it                                 would say okay I've selected the picker                                 tool it didn't say that but this is the                                 pic at all it would select it now pick                                 the object you want to change you do                                 that the state's changed the help system                                 changed recordings it now see those                                 square you know marks pull on those to                                 make it bigger you know push on them to                                 make them so whatever it said so                                 basically took you through the whole                                 process of going from something which                                 gave you a product but then could you                                 know take you into the higher level or                                 the more sophisticated use of the tools                                 up and you walk away with that as a                                 trained person I'm just saying that                                 because it sounds similar you don't know                                 kind of challenge yeah and the other                                 thing I want to say is that what you're                                 describing here in terms of connecting                                 the dots is very much in resonates to me                                 with the notion of narratives which I'm                                 going to be talking about tomorrow so                                 yes it is it is not a dot connecting                                 kind of experience we all go watch his                                 talk being attacked I think this is                                 really an interesting idea and it's                                 getting me thinking a number of things                                 but I think from the discussion I'm                                 getting kind of a little worried that                                 we're kind of having wow you know                                 wizards and we could have do this and we                                 could guide them to picking with that                                 and I'm thinking yeah who's going to do                                 this and also if we have all this                                 guidance you know I'm a you know one of                                 the things is we you know we want this                                 to be an on-ramp to the power of Drupal                                 and one of the things that's neat about                                 Drupal is that you know it's it's                                 basically unlimited and so I think a lot                                 of it is how you know I think what we                                 want to have is we do want to have some                                 things that you know kind of out of the                                 box as they're installing it they can                                 make it do something for the people who                                 are at the very sort of beginning but I                                 think what we need to do is communicate                                 that these are just teeny tiny wimpy                                 examples and that there's a big universe                                 out there that they can they can explore                                 at their own pace                                 as they want to and kind of give some                                 pointers to those things but not try to                                 just not try to do everything for them                                 but just you know I think it's a lot                                 about to making clear what we're doing                                 and not trying to do much but but                                 definitely having something yeah Oh or                                 three something's or whatever it is but                                 i don't i'm worried about this kind of                                 you know yeah this is trying to be                                 really really perfect instead of just                                 kind of going let's be good yeah none of                                 this would give you one hundred percent                                 of what you need this is all three ideas                                 are open-ended right and it's just meant                                 as a means to help you pay for your                                 first bath in the jungle                                 yeah so very similar to what Sharon was                                 saying I feel like one thing really to                                 avoid in this approach is you know oh I                                 want to build that's that they do want                                 to build the portfolio a hit portfolio                                 and they install it and then all the                                 magic happens while the you know the bar                                 is going and then they're in the site                                 and in a way they're almost even more                                 abstracted from what it is to build a                                 Drupal website like all this idea of the                                 modules of the configuration of maybe                                 even permissions are involved in like                                 things are getting changed behind the                                 scenes it's almost like this question of                                 are we trying to empower new users to be                                 awesome site builders like all of us can                                 be or are we trying to give them sort of                                 a to start with a scaled down approach                                 hope that maybe eighty percent of the                                 stuff they're gonna want to do is cover                                 by that and then the rest of the twenty                                 percent be this sort of like scramble to                                 figure out what it is you know I mean                                 and they can go to the community and                                 they can try and figure it out but yeah                                 you know                                 mm-hmm                                 maybe the concern you're expressing is                                 that if we take people by the hand so                                 explicitly we don't get them that we                                 don't help them learn what to do yeah                                 exactly and that was the idea with this                                 up to speed thing and just that if you                                 give them like a bone and they can just                                 go run with it in sort of way to redo my                                 slides I really like that approach I                                 just kind of do a follow-up to tears on                                 in a sense when I'm kind of saying is                                 you know I like this you know let's have                                 one of these things and going towards                                 your concern but some of it is not so                                 much what we provide that I'm thinking                                 we need to address as well but                                 addressing this thing of what we're                                 telling them we're providing so I'm                                 saying you know here's the you know this                                 is a site you can build we kind of said                                 you know this is like a you know a                                 starter example this is an example you                                 know us a simple example to get you                                 started of you know or something like                                 that we're communicating to them this is                                 the tip of the iceberg and we're                                 communicating to them throughout the                                 process of this tip of the iceberg yeah                                 if there's a whole lot more there that                                 they can explore and so it's really kind                                 of a thing about terminology and how we                                 frame it as opposed to what whether we                                 provide this or not yeah I think having                                 it be this some clear examples they can                                 go in and actually build a something is                                 great I'm just saying which let's make                                 it clear to them what we're giving them                                 and not like them think that this is                                 Drupal I understand a grown son and I'm                                 convinced that the community won't let                                 us and do that in my ideal world Drupal                                 is a framework barely has an admin                                 interface and it lets me easily add                                 modules and build custom stuff from                                 scratch because I have fun doing that                                 yeah I think what we're getting at it's                                 very important but it sounds to me like                                 it it's more about like a web app so is                                 it possible to have like like an                                 application that's sort of like a story                                 like a game for people to be introduced                                 to Drupal of all levels they want to do                                 all sorts of things and download by                                 playing the game by connecting the                                 and the numbers creating their customize                                 profile of Drupal kind of like what is                                 it modernizer does that I think you                                 click and create your and I guess it is                                 just like drupal gardens also in a way                                 does does that much more you know to two                                 forms i think im just that possible in                                 your world I'm just glad I'm getting                                  idea other ideas in response or not so                                  I'm I mean that's this is this is what                                  I'm looking for other options to explore                                  and I at this time for me any idea goes                                  yeah okay just don't know what you are                                  interred for what century little bit                                  though but that's Pleasant was alright                                  so going back to the question which                                  Becky asked and I think I agree to what                                  he said because what is happening right                                  now is that we are putting people new                                  users especially into this wall of text                                  and options making it overwhelming and                                  intimidating and that's why it's very                                  difficult and and we have sort of the                                  same approach for Drupal gardens with                                  the whole you know what we are talking                                  very similar to that and you know I've                                  done tons of research and we made it as                                  simple as we can within the constraints                                  that we live in it's still it's still                                  you know a long way to go but the point                                  I'm trying to make is that if we give                                  them that this a little it's kind of a                                  psychology thing is that you have to let                                  someone succeed on the first task and                                  then you know if they struggle because                                  we don't want them to alienate right                                  away so as we want to win the hearts and                                  minds of people and we have to do that                                  by empowering them so we have to provide                                  success in the first steps I mean we'll                                  hit any everybody will run into some                                  kind of wall somewhere but at least                                  build some confidence                                  yeah so on the subject of you know depth                                  noppe trapping people in the idea of                                  Drupal is just a portfolio or just or                                  whatever some time earlier in this                                  conference someone tweeted I don't                                  remember who it was about Google                                  somewhere around here proposing                                  something similar to what they do with                                  their own apps where you know if you're                                  a new user or if they've just change the                                  UIF from under you they have messages                                  that pop up that say you know you want                                  to do XO you can do that over here hey                                  did you know you can do this go over                                  here and then you can dismiss those or                                  turn them off but there's that kind of                                  hints of more that is coming or more                                  that you then you know about and I think                                  that could be a really really helpful                                  way to you know help on board people                                  with Drupal hey did you know you can add                                  modules to your site yes and stuff like                                  that there's otherwise people don't                                  realize that yes as well as you know hey                                  you know Drupal can do more than what                                  this particular pre packaged app does so                                  some something like that kind of                                  approach I think could potentially help                                  with both problems for you know hey did                                  you know you can add events that are                                  already here and hey do you know you can                                  add more modules and do something                                  different so that's I think something we                                  can consider as a great way to help get                                  people up that ramp of realizing just                                  how much there is to Drupal yeah we have                                  outstanding issues indic you right now                                  that discuss providing tips are some                                  kind of mechanism that I mean that's                                  another I mean the way I've framed                                  connecting the dots or idea was big                                  picture thinking but yes we want to                                  provide some we have need to find a                                  pattern that on the content create                                  content list where you show the article                                  on the page and the forum topic to                                  provide a link create your own                                  yes yeah yeah I just I just want to                                  check at that that's some definitely                                  thing that we were talking about when we                                  were thinking about the up to speed aid                                  that we were proposing um it's                                  definitely more complex implementation                                  but what's really great about it is the                                  if you show a slide show of like                                     slides to users like they're probably                                  not going to remember most of it which                                  is really unfortunate but the way that                                  people actually do remember things is by                                  doing it and that's a great way to split                                  to you know go into the middle between                                  like do you do everything for them or do                                  you like just tell them all the                                  information at the beginning but it you                                  know it's this idea of like you have a                                  tutorial that they follow along with and                                  it's very contextual and it actually                                  involves I'm doing that because then                                  they develop that mental muscle memory                                  it's you know it's just more complicated                                  to implement and then something you know                                  initially but like definitely something                                  to think about and like studies have                                  shown that like if you tell people to if                                  you show people how to do things in the                                  context like that's how they understand                                  and that's how they remember them and                                  that's why things like that are very                                  helpful I mean I guess you just have to                                  make sure that you're guiding them like                                  kids like you don't want random things                                  to pop up and random places and being                                  like oh you're installing a theme did                                  you also know that you can install                                  modules because people be like well I'm                                  installing a theme right now what's the                                  module you know so it's just I guess you                                  know is those texts yeah yeah exactly I                                  mean it's just to make sure that the Ark                                  of you know the design and it's well                                  tested and yeah yeah yeah yeah                                  thank you thank you all for doing this                                  session and yeah I think one of the the                                  the most important things we need to see                                  here is that all of the three possible                                  distributions are just our first                                  examples for what we can do with Drupal                                  and one of the most important point for                                  me in the process of portfolio the                                  slough was the actual involvement of the                                  community and basically with the most                                  important difference that that the                                  community is involved in the entire                                  design process from the start so                                  basically I what I mean is I could have                                  probably hammered out that installation                                  profile within a single day on my own                                  yes and but we already have like I think                                  I counted them three months ago but back                                  then I think they were                                                   profiles oh man we don't want to go to                                  modules food right and so I looked into                                  many of them and they were almost                                  undocumented you didn't know what you                                  actually get it wasn't clarified for                                  which audience it is which features are                                  contained I mean everything that makes                                  up a product basically which makes you                                  which makes everyone well here too is a                                  product regardless of what kind of                                  product we are talking about and so                                  that's basically yeah my most important                                  lesson from portfolio less forest                                  basically two yeah document the process                                  publicly and get as many people as                                  possible involved                                  with different perspectives so yeah we                                  can hopefully am up with the yeah in my                                  mind then will the very first                                  installation profile or distribution                                  that was built by the community and                                  designed by the community in the open                                  and and it's also going to be maintained                                  by the community just like the                                  installation profiles in Drupal core are                                  maintained by the community with the                                  difference that these profiles might not                                  end up in core so for example portfolio                                  has many features that won't it won't be                                  able to do in don't fit in coin with                                  with core only I guess we will have like                                                                                                          deliver the functionality we are going                                  to need and and yeah so that's so                                  there's a there's a very lengthy design                                  process involved with lots of design                                  decisions but also technical decisions                                  and for the community it's important to                                  figure out how we actually build a                                  product I mean in the community because                                  we never did something like that before                                  and the core profiles don't really count                                  because yeah so if I if I understand you                                  correctly you say we should build one                                  that does add country and goes farther                                  than core can do right and it is also                                  that's the current plan for portfolio                                  and to be based on Drupal                                           consume content modules and when we are                                  done with that then we will actually                                  have some good or better understanding                                  what is actually needed yeah                                          like such a site with Drupal and then we                                  have also better understanding what do                                  we actually need in core in order to                                  support that                                  big use case but what I'm really after                                  is like the it doesn't really matter                                  that much to me whether we are building                                  a portfolio site or not for me the most                                  important step is really doing this                                  activity to figure out how we do it I                                  mean yeah there was also earlier this                                  the question about is it a block or not                                  and how we came up with with the name                                  portfolio and the npad empty the the                                  goal of the of the product and and yeah                                  the ed the course for that was pretty                                  simple we basically the initial course                                  was just looked at Larry side I looked                                  at your side look at my side alert all                                  of our own signs and and yeah it's quite                                  obvious we we all want to pre send                                  ourselves our work and we don't really                                  want blocks we represent ourselves on a                                  map and that's basically that was                                  basically the most trivial product we                                  could build and for which we actually                                  have our own new patients yeah so we                                  solve our own problem and that's I think                                  a very good approach to to ya gain                                  experience in this area and we could                                  also do the same for there for the                                  on-ramp profile and I'm specifically                                  thinking there about local Drupal user                                  groups I which could use website I'm                                  running runs one since like six months                                  and really having the problem there that                                  I am need to use Facebook and I need to                                  use all kinds of strange tools outside                                  because there is no simple way to                                  simply say okay give me a site for my                                  local user group so we can plan this                                  thing we can organize the events we can                                  discuss stuff and document what we                                  discussed last time and who attend that                                  on whatever I mean and yet that's in the                                  end exactly the the the original idea of                                  snowman or on-ramp and so again we could                                  solve our own problems there and with                                  such a profile we could hear yes start                                  to to support our grassroots yeah I like                                  the idea I think maybe then if I'm                                  thinking fantasy that instead of signing                                  up to Drupal work you'd install your own                                  drupal.org and you'd be connected one                                  last thing um so there was also this the                                  idea of basically clicking together your                                  profile and I think we should defer all                                  of these these ideas to lighter because                                  when we really start to use profiles                                  more in the community then this will be                                  just simply the logical after step so                                  yeah I don't think we want actually we                                  actually want to pre send a lengthy                                  wizard to everyone who wants to just                                  simply try to Drupal on drupal org those                                  users just want you well perhaps                                  download one profile and start playing                                  with it and at some point we want our                                  profiles to allow yeah app features                                  certain function with functionality to                                  them that isn't contained right from the                                  start but right now our main challenge                                  is really to to get that process started                                  the energy profile process will be an                                  interesting excess                                  yeah so um do just to ya two things one                                  is a small-knit begin thing but the                                  other one I'm I have a I don't have the                                  answer and I don't know anyone who would                                  have the answer for the question but the                                  first one is so what we are saying is                                  that choose a profile or nah just giving                                  up what's the out of box experience i'm                                  thinking probably it's it's worth                                  considering doing the opposite way is                                  like give me the outer box experience or                                  choose because it kind of sends a                                  different message that's one thing we                                  can talk about that the other question i                                  have is that thinking about it is like                                  the I experience is that I'm the site                                  builder I am the designer I'm the                                  content creator so it is based on the                                  roles and not so much about what am i                                  designing for whereas in a group it's                                  probably more separated in the world                                  it's completely different like the                                  distributor or kind of thing so maybe                                  it's important because all those                                  experiences are going to be different                                  and if you are talking so much about the                                  onboarding experience what we are going                                  to present is going to be all so                                  different based on the rolls through was                                  that a question in a question is so is                                  it worth rethinking or not what we                                  thinking is it what we I don't know it's                                  it takes a while to absorb all these                                  things and then probably think about it                                  because once we go start designing and                                  implementing we never go in retrospect                                  is that is this the right way to go                                  about it so i would encourage people to                                  think about does it make more sense to                                  have these three buckets based on roles                                  and not on what is on the website yeah i                                  mean i'm at league events that we won't                                  have                                                                      liking i think it's it's working as a                                  conversation starter and i think                                  you're bringing up valid points yeah                                  turn it inside out upside down please I                                  said go ahead actually want to piggyback                                  on what son just said one of the things                                  I liked about the portfolio concept when                                  he first posted it was that they target                                  audience was a drupal developer because                                  you know one of the core concepts and                                  use abilities know that user and you are                                  not your own user yeah which makes it                                  really hard to know what your user base                                  wants if you don't know what your user                                  base is and we run the risk of having to                                  abstract the target for some of these                                  profiles yeah and that leads us into                                  analysis paralysis and all that                                  wonderful stuff that keeps things from                                  getting done but if we can say you know                                  we want an install profile for the solo                                  developer who wants to show off them                                  yeah we know what that person wants                                  because we've got                                                     room yeah if we want and it's all                                  profile not for you know an organization                                  that wants to discuss and get stuff out                                  no it's an install profile for a user                                  group for something like Drupal or PHP                                  or something like that it would have                                  serious I'd like to know yeah that is a                                  very specific targeted in each case that                                  it's a very specific targeted user that                                  we can then build towards without                                  running the risk of well what about this                                  group in this group we just know this is                                  what we're looking for and then once                                  you've got that built maybe we can                                  generalize it a bit but it's a first                                  step I really like that idea oh I like                                  that as a focus for ya exercise son is                                  proposed yeah exactly how you use cases                                  and users that we know intimately yeah                                  are a good first step question is is how                                  inviting that will be to the rest of the                                  world but it's a first step and if we                                  can even build that and then generalize                                  from dejah great hi I think that you're                                  solving a very a very real problem for                                  the business and I think it's a great                                  idea I would like to help but it's not                                  obvious in which pathway to help from                                  the community because there's these                                  three projects that are all kind of                                  doing the same thing with this like the                                  I the US the world                                  concept because there's lots of use                                  cases that can follow each one of those                                  buckets so I'm not going to even go                                  there it's not one thing right those                                  things or conceptual buckets and I don't                                  want to I'm not going to try to solve                                  that here but I what I'm saying is that                                  there's a gap from a piece of vision and                                  it's indicative of all questions being                                  brought that is let's define what                                  installation profiles are these markers                                  that go with them that type of thing I                                  would like to help and I just don't see                                  where where a good place to start is                                  that maybe this is a because I don't do                                  a lot of the open source contribution                                  I'd like to start solving it and maybe                                  this is what you guys have run into a                                  lot before but I don't know like who do                                  I talk to you I talk to you yeah do I                                  copy yeah which well we should like to                                  help building designing conceptualizing                                  yes I an architect I can and I'm coming                                  from yes business and account management                                  and everything it's like I don't care i                                  will help because it's such a valid                                  valid good for the community for drupal                                  developers and businesses and it's a                                  triple garden site right because they                                  wanted to have the entry point into                                  drupal much easier but then this is                                  going to be something where you can as a                                  developer rip it apart a little bit more                                  obtainable and so that's where it's                                  gonna I think that the learning from                                  Drupal Gardens would be great to                                  leverage in the situation and so it's a                                  it's a very cohesive effort I think the                                  community but I'd like to help so I'll                                  talk to anybody after this please do                                  yeah okay thank you very much uh yeah                                  thanks for all this feedback done
