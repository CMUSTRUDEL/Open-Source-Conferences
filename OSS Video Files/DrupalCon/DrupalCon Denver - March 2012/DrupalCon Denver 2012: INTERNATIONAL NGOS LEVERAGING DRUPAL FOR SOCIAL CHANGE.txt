these                                organizations are leveraging Drupal by                                show of hands how many people in the                                room actually work for a non-profit or                                volunteer with the nonprofit okay wow                                that's pretty much everyone in the room                                and how many people build websites for                                for these organizations all right so                                we're in good company I mean this is the                                pretty much everyone here a little bit                                about this presentation it's a little                                bit more strategic so I'm going to be                                talking about about the impacts of                                Drupal how is showing up in the in the                                real world rather than the nuts and                                bolts of views and and panels and how                                the specific modules I do have some of                                that information if we want to talk                                about that after the session or perhaps                                in the QA we can do that a lot of the                                people that built the technologies and                                I'm going to show here are actually in                                the room as well and so I'm hoping that                                they're going to be able to help answer                                some of the questions and share a little                                bit more background the real key is how                                we can leverage Drupal that's the point                                of the presentation and I really want to                                say I'm honored to be the one speaking                                up here I really believe that everyone                                in this room could probably be giving                                this presentation i'm speaking on behalf                                of hundreds probably thousands of people                                and really absolutely honored so a                                little bit about me my name is Aaron                                pavam one of the coke                                civic actions civic actions has been in                                the intersection of Drupal and                                nonprofits for about seven years on both                                I'm based out of Oakland California I'm                                a new dad of a daughter of                                          this is my seventh drupalcon so I've                                been participating in drupalcon since oz                                con in Amsterdam in                                              important than anything I really have a                                really deep commitment to empowering                                people in organizations and that's                                really how I found Drupal I found it was                                the best tool for the job I came in                                through the nonprofit route i'm also on                                Twitter and that's how you could follow                                my organization or me so here's the                                agenda what I want to do is share a                                little bit about the history of Drupal                                and social change then the bulk of the                                presentation is really going to be                                exploring some real world examples of                                how Drupal is being implemented and then                                like I said we'll open up the                                conversation have some Q&A perhaps some                                resource sharing so we can learn from                                each other as some of you know Drupal                                has a very long history of social change                                and I want to set some of that                                background because I think it's                                important to give some context and how                                we got here is Drupal as a advocacy tool                                a little bit of my own personal history                                like I said I came from the community                                activist and advocacy background I was                                working on voter registration geo TV                                projects and was doing that in                                          you know in that time period I first                                learned about Drupal in                                                 through the Dean space campaign how many                                people remember Dean space or civic                                space okay so a few hands there was a                                project this so this is back in the in                                                                                                       open-source CMS's were pretty new                                the scene and there was the it was in                                the political environment I was working                                on the Dennis Kucinich presidential                                campaign there was the Howard Dean                                campaign was really emerging and a                                couple really brilliant students Zak                                Rosen Neal drum who are at chapter three                                now created a Drupal of distribution                                essentially that took Drupal really                                formed it for political campaigns                                integrated it with a CRM called City CRM                                 added a lot of functionality that was                                 really specific towards doing online                                 advocacy in that space it was a                                 essentially distribution before                                 distribution it ended up being a hosted                                 environment before the Aqua type of                                 hosted environment and it was a fork of                                 Drupal at a certain point and then                                 reemerged back into Drupal five so there                                 was during that period it really brought                                 in a lot of progressive oriented folks                                 that were in the Howard Dean space in                                 the political space it's where I got                                 introduced to it I was running some                                 political campaigns at the time and                                 really saw the power of an open source                                 CMS and how it could really be used and                                 leverage to make real sustainable impact                                 now when we talk about nonprofit                                 advocacy a lot of people there have                                 different views about what advocacy is                                 whether you're talking about advocacy at                                 the DC level or wherever your your state                                 government if you're talking about you                                 know bringing your communities together                                 you know citizen engagement that type of                                 thing and then people have a lot of                                 preconceptions about nonprofits I mean I                                 think a lot of people in this room                                 actually know a whole lot about these                                 preconceptions and then also where they                                 don't actually match reality all the                                 time I mean traditionally nonprofits are                                 seen or seen by the outside world as                                 slow bureaucratic and you know generally                                 the people are passionate about their                                 mission may be inside organizations they                                 don't know a lot about technology or                                 they're more likely than not                                 under-resourced                                 you know so they rely on a lot of                                 volunteer report volunteer support                                 there's not necessarily a lot of                                 long-term thinking they don't have the                                 luxury of doing a lot of strategic                                 planning that the enterprise often has                                 and sometimes there's a disconnect                                 between the boards and the stakeholders                                 and the implementers I know a lot of                                 this stuff is not true you probably know                                 a lot of the stuff is not true as well                                 and there's different scales of                                 nonprofits and you know the larger                                 nonprofits this actually doesn't                                 necessarily match up as well however                                 there are places where it is true and in                                 one of the places where a lot of                                 organizations struggle really is around                                 having really stellar not technology                                 support and yet there's never been a                                 time like this you know there's never                                 been a time where the problems that                                 nonprofits are trying to address have                                 been bigger I mean if you're working a                                 poverty or natural disasters climate                                 change population issues human rights I                                 mean I could keep going on about energy                                 and conflicts than the Horn of Africa                                 and globalization and world hunger and                                 sex trafficking and animal welfare and                                 extinction and education I have more                                 that I could say here the the problem                                 hasn't been more urgent that we support                                 these types of organizations and really                                 helping in their mission nonprofits                                 however for the first time in history                                 have the same tools available to them as                                 the enterprise and we're really seeing                                 that I mean here at drupalcon we have                                 the exact technology that we are using                                 at sony music or you know any of these                                 big corporations we could apply the same                                 technology to the social sector the                                 bottom line is this never before we've                                 had how we                                 ever had a chance to leverage so much                                 social change I really believe that                                 Drupal holds the key to a sustainable                                 future there's so much work to be done                                 there's so much work that we can learn                                 from each other around the work that                                 we're already doing around recipes case                                 studies sharing modules and best                                 practices so the way I see it is you                                 guys are really the heroes we need to be                                 sharing this information with each other                                 I want to start getting that                                 conversation going now so what I'm going                                 to demonstrate it's about eight                                 different case studies of real-world                                 impact using Drupal again it's not a                                 technical conversation but specific ways                                 that were making change I really hope                                 that this is you know this conversation                                 is a is a seed that inspires new people                                 to enter the conversation and then also                                 for us that have been working in the                                 space for a long time to really                                 facilitate connections and sharing ways                                 that we're making real impact together                                 so this is a picture from January

hurty the haiti earthquake the                                 big news and what was happening in the                                 media and and it was amazing was people                                 were really using innovative ways of                                 using SMS messaging to note donate to                                 the Red Cross and other organizations to                                 raise money for the victims of the quake                                 there was also a quiet revolution going                                 on in other ways that people were                                 raising money for victims like this one                                 of the things that Mercy Corps did which                                 is a site built on Drupal with a                                 in-house team based in Portland Oregon                                 was and actually the Portland Drupal                                 community supported Mercy Corps as well                                 they had a personal fundraising pages                                 were created and they had over                                          the signup pages within a week of the                                 earthquake here's an example of what the                                 splash page of the of the fundraising                                 pages and as you can see you could sign                                 up as an individual or as a civic group                                 or as a business and then you can then                                 go out to your community raise money                                 pull that money there's some sort of                                 gamification of how much money you can                                 raise for your community so rather than                                 raising you know donating ten dollars by                                 phone you know these folks are raising                                 twenty-seven thousand dollars sometimes                                 or higher you know based on their their                                 group actually some of them are a lot                                 higher than that here's an example of                                 what one of those fundraising pages                                 looks like and you could see on the side                                 some examples of other people that were                                 raising funds as well you could put a                                 personal message in here it really has                                 people own making a difference                                 themselves so the results of this in one                                 week $                                                                 personal fundraising pages for the                                 victims these were all nodes that donors                                 sent to their friends all in all Mercy                                 Corps raised four million dollars four                                 million u.s. dollars for haiti relief so                                 really successful campaign something i                                 think could be leveraged for a lot of                                 different organizations                                                  one of my favorite new global nonprofits                                 they're a global grassroots advocacy

I'll let it speak                                 for itself                                 getting the number                                                  awareness planet-wide is a big task one                                 of the ways that                                                       problem is they want to coordinate                                 global days of action for

             source Drupal modules available to all                                 of us the next case study i want to                                 share about is amnesty international so                                 civic actions has been working with                                 Amnesty International for about well                                 since                                                                   CMS that they had to a Drupal base CMS                                 integrated it with civvy CRM and started                                 on Drupal                                                         migrated them to Drupal                                                 they're doing tons of stuff with Drupal                                 and probably I don't have enough time to                                 really get into all of it it's one of                                 the sites I probably know the best out                                 of all of these Drupal city CRM alfresco                                 document management and also doing                                 mobile going back to                                      ate one of the big splashes around the                                 amnesty site in                                                        the first Drupal sites to really deploy                                 i                                                                       for different languages english spanish                                 french and arabic so the whole length to                                 the whole page will flip all the nodes                                 will change language so you could reach                                 all those different audiences the drupal                                 site is integrated with an alfresco                                 document server which has                                        documents for reporters and other folks                                 you know it uses a google search                                 appliance actually is also integrated in                                 this city CRM it's an open source CRM if                                 you're not familiar with it they use it                                 all their membership is inside City CRM                                 they do all their mailing through civvy                                 they do use civvy contribute to do                                 donation pages active as a module I                                 think there's a hundred twenty seven                                 thousand records when we first started                                 in this and then the annual report we                                 made it instead of doing their printed                                 annual report they now do a PDF but they                                 have a mobile-friendly website                                 essentially so this work was not only                                 getting them up into Drupal but training                                 their internal staff so that it could                                 take it over and totally be empowered to                                 use Drupal themselves here's an example                                 of what the Arabic version of the same                                 homepage looks like we refactored civvy                                 CRM a bit so it's a lot easier to do                                 this now I'm City CRMs new AP is or off                                 the hook so you could do this way easier                                 than the way that we did it but if                                 you're registering for a new account                                 based on your the pool down of your your                                 country then it would like forward you                                 to the right make sure you're registered                                 for the right country this was for the                                 Secretariat which is kind of the overall                                 arching amnesty                                 international here's an example of what                                 the alfresco document server looks like                                 when you search for something actually                                 this is a little bit better of what the                                 search is and it's and it looks a little                                 there's a lot to search on here but for                                 example if you're looking this                                 screenshot is I want to look at                                 documents based on better us-based about                                 the death penalty that are written in                                 English and that have certain you know                                 that have audio or video or have events                                 related to it or whatever then it would                                 display all those results in this case                                 is                                                                   powerful all that stuff is contributed                                 back happy to share a lot more about                                 that if you're interested after the                                 session so the next case study I want to                                 talk about is Human Rights Watch so                                 Human Rights Watch they're one of the                                 the leading independent organizations                                 about defending and protecting human                                 rights they do a lot of great stuff                                 around challenging governments and                                 holding them to account around abusive                                 practices around human rights law they                                 list the international community to                                 really support human rights for everyone                                 this site it was built by Enrique osses                                 I want to say and he's in the Drupal                                 community pretty active actually I don't                                 know is he are you here Enrique no all                                 right so they really took                                 internationalization is a more recent                                 site they took internationalization to                                 the next level so here's an example of                                 what the homepage of Human Rights Watch                                 looks like zoomed up you could see that                                 there's nine languages hear that Human                                 Rights Watch displays and I have some                                 screenshots Spanish                                 Russian these are from yesterday                                 Japanese Hebrew German French Chinese                                 Arabic so again tons of                                 internationalisation                                 internationalisation is even been                                 expanded way beyond that now so it's                                 available for all of us it's something                                 we need to be thinking about as we're                                 thinking about international NGOs                                 thinking way beyond just English the                                 next case that I want to present is a                                 oxfam international so oxidative is a                                 coalition actually a lot of people don't                                 know this it's it's a                                                  really under one umbrella                                              they fight poverty and injustice there                                 was recently chapter                                                  internet for them that has six thousand                                 users from across the world and it's                                 really a place for Oxfam to connect all                                 the people that are in the field offices                                 in all these                                                             each other there's actually a great                                 long-form case study on the last Rubicon                                 where Matt Cheney shares goes in deep                                 about this one and if you're interested                                 I highly recommend it what was really                                 key about this particular project was it                                 was a place it was a fit in the middle                                 solution it was Drupal was the one place                                 where all the different component placed                                 all the different component elements of                                 the organization plug-in together                                 reduced a lot of costs consolidated a                                 lot of pieces of Technology also had                                 some document management ldap server or                                 single sign-on etc they had in place                                 editors for for content and users have                                 their own dashboard depending on what                                 specific thing that there                                 monitoring so here's an example of what                                 the dashboard looks like for their                                 intranet you could customize your own                                 dashboard which is I think one of the                                 coolest parts find the individual groups                                 of the people that you want to connect                                 with share documents really powerful                                 document search library they use a pack                                 the Apache Solr for search and real-time                                 chat in this on their on their intranet                                 also one of the really cool aspects of                                 this is there's a lot of things around                                 related content so if you're looking for                                 a particular issue around poverty and                                 Somalia for example you can find the                                 other people and the organization that                                 might be working on that so a big                                 aspects of discoverability Learning                                 Center you know this was um there's a                                 lot I could say about this I'm so                                 impressed with this site actually here's                                 some profile pages of individuals really                                 heavy site so they use a lot of like                                 caching varnish and stuff I'm not going                                 to get too deep into the technical                                 aspects however and then of course                                 groups and file repository and like I                                 said the soul our search so again all                                 Drupal all open all available to all our                                 organizations                                 Greenpeace International has been slow                                 to adopt Drupal but there's been one                                 Greenpeace area the the Greenpeace UK                                 has really adopted it and taken it on so                                 i want i want to show what Greenpeace UK                                 has done they're really leading I think                                 Greenpeace is going to move in this                                 direction you guys probably don't need                                 too much introduction to them but                                 they're headquartered in Amsterdam to                                                                                                     there in                                                                 going to show you here for Greenpeace UK                                 were built by torch box which is a                                 Drupal development shop in in England so                                 the big breakthrough that they developed                                 was something called local groups where                                 they call it the get active area and                                 it's where active supporters are part of                                 a local network which has dedicated                                 coordinators and key activists that have                                 taken on this specific responsibility                                 and then coordinate an offline group so                                 the Greenpeace headquarters delegates                                 projects down to these local                                 coordinators and then they synchronize                                 the activities across the country so as                                 a Greenpeace supporter I could go in to                                 the Greenpeace UK type in my I don't                                 think they call it a zip code but at the                                 equivalent of a zip code and I could see                                 the the groups that are near me join a                                 group and when I join a group I'm taken                                 to a group page and from here a group                                 administrator can really dictates which                                 on this page this was designed by it                                 uses organic groups at its core but they                                 really took a lot they stripped away a                                 lot of the interface of organic groups                                 and they have this header piece                                 members that are part of the group the                                 current campaign that's dictated by the                                 administrator of the group and then                                 upcoming events and such so this is                                 really like an activity hub of my local                                 community you know so there might be                                 this community in West London meets at a                                 pub you know every week or something and                                 that this is their their homepage so                                 Greenpeace is really interesting in that                                 they do pretty splashy media events                                 often times to demonstrate what's                                 happening out there I want to share a                                 success story of one of these media                                 events that they did and I have a short                                 video here to set some context                                 so the the backdrop of this is that                                 mattel which is one of the biggest toy                                 manufacturers in the world is using                                 packaging from Asia Pulp and Paper in                                 Asia Pulp and Paper has a pretty bad                                 track record of popping Indonesia and                                 rainforests actually causing threats to                                 Tigers with extinction they've been                                 caught multiple times and find this is                                 green pieces way of really putting                                 pressure on Mattel and really the supply                                 chain to stop using paper from Asian                                 paper pulp and paper Asia paper pulp and                                 paper so on jun                                                   campaign they then did a fate that you                                 know it's a Drupal site went to those                                 groups that I just showed you it became                                 the main campaign they asked people to                                 go on facebook on two on two Barbies                                 facebook page and and sharing the story                                 of the rainforest Deacon's destruction                                 by jun                                                                  page became so overwhelmed with comments                                 that Michelle Mattel actually had to                                 turn off their Facebook and closed the                                 page the good news is that by October                                 Mattel was getting relentlessly                                 inundated by the Greenpeace activists                                 and and finally decided that it wasn't                                 worth it another toy manufacturer                                 actually thought that they were next and                                 came forward and said that they were                                 going to stop using Asia pulp and paper                                 and then it really forced Mattel to do                                 the same thing so a three month campaign                                 changed the their practices                                 and here's Ken's tweet of the big news                                 all right so International Rescue                                 Committee they respond to humanitarian                                 crisis and help rebuild lives it was                                 really founded by the cast of a Albert                                 Einstein and they work in                                                                                                                       rescue org they have a website that was                                 built by Jackson River a great                                 organization that's also here at                                 drupalcon and Jackson River built a                                 website for them called rescue gifts so                                 the problem with raising funds was that                                 they were raising funds and get active                                 which is a SAS offering but there was a                                 lot of limitations to the SAS offering                                 and they had a first version of this                                 gift site and trying to raise funds for                                 their organization                                                  major pushes for fundraising one happens                                 at the end of the year around                                 thanksgiving the other ones during a                                 mother's day and they don't actually                                 sell products they look or get straight                                 donations what they do is they have                                 these symbolic gifts so you could buy a                                 year of school for a young girl or you                                 could buy health worker training you're                                 not actually buying the health care the                                 year of school but you're buying the                                 equivalent of a year school for the                                 organization and the kind of work that                                 they do so they set up the specific                                 website it's called gifts rescue org and                                 you know moved it from this host it get                                 active solution to a pure Drupal                                 solution you know it uses ubercart                                 essentially in here you can see you                                 could add a gift to your cart you could                                 search by gift price you know for                                 Mother's Day or what have you and then                                 at the end you get it goes through like                                 a process where you could get a fit you                                 to choose a physical card or or a PDF                                 but they have a fulfillment process                                 where you get actually it males out a                                 physical card and a really successful                                 implementation how we know it was                                 successful is that from                                              doubled the number of donations the                                 following year in the upgrade of the                                 site they did three fold the number of                                 donations from moving off the disaster                                 Lucien so another great example of you                                 know implementing Drupal getting it away                                 from the proprietary solutions here all                                 right I think this is my last case study                                 before we open it up to a conversation                                 and this one's ActionAid pretty short                                 description or demonstration here so                                 they really empower people the fight for                                 the rights that they're denied they                                 really empower people on their own land                                 around the resources and helping them                                 find their own solutions the big wind or                                 the technology that was implemented here                                 was a technology did multi-site per                                 country on a single Drupal instance so                                 like I said they're in                                                  so it's organic groups based but the                                 organics groups is based on the sub                                 domain and it allows for different                                 domains for different groups so it's a                                 ip-based when you come it kind of                                 figures it out and puts you in the right                                 organic group and then what's really                                 cool is there's this group to group                                 sharing so like a group administrator                                 saying you're in one of the country's us                                 and you want to share some content in                                 your ganna group what it does is it                                 automatically creates                                                    of holder text in the other groups for                                 the other groups to translate that                                 content                                 and and put it into a moderation queue                                 and so it uses og as this engine for                                 sharing between countries essentially                                 across languages pretty innovative kind                                 of hard to demonstrate it in a slide but                                 here's a picture of the action aid                                 website so like I said the results                                 internationalization of content in                                 organic groups ip-based and making it                                 really easy for editors to share content                                 between different countries and manage                                 their sites from content written around                                 the world so the bottom line with all of                                 this is there's really a lot of work to                                 do I mean there's so many great examples                                 I put together a lot more case studies                                 and then I've demonstrated here and one                                 of the things that I found through this                                 process is it took me a lot of work to                                 find out what was happening and that's I                                 think one of the places where we could                                 really step up our engagement with each                                 other all of us are working on these                                 Drupal projects all of us are doing                                 really cool innovative stuff I'm really                                 hot you know confident that every one of                                 us could be up here demonstrating work                                 that we've done and and showing other                                 examples that you know we don't know                                 about the call to action is really how                                 do we share this information with each                                 other you know what are the how can we                                 make it easy to share recipes around                                 what modules were using how we're doing                                 it how we could replicate our success                                 with each other and so you can use                                      events stuff or the rescue stuff or you                                 could use you know Jackson river                                 springboard stuff that like you know                                 like I didn't even get to it but like                                 ACLU is using and the ACLU you know we                                 don't know about this stuff with each                                 other so                                 I want to put it out there I want to                                 talk with folks see if there's a way                                 that we can better share information and                                 how we can work together and with that I                                 want to open it up to some Q&A so we                                 have about                                                              if you have a case study that you know                                 about that you want to share if you have                                 questions about the technology I think a                                 lot of the organizations that I spoke                                 about Jackson river where Corp chapter                                   torch box data scribe civic actions                                 Mercy Corps there a lot of them are here                                 so they could probably answer a lot of                                 the questions as well and let's get this                                 conversation going so there's a                                 microphone in the center of the room and                                 we could start there                                 I my name is kevin i work at kiva going                                 off of what you just said we've been                                 trying to collaborate with people and                                 i'm wondering what do you think the best                                 platform is for trying to collaborate                                 and on that note I think there's sort of                                 two things one is sort of showing off in                                 sharing work on a more business type                                 level and then they also is like                                 actually getting down to nitty gritty                                 and sharing code and is the best                                 platform trying to get that back on                                 drupal.org or is it doing what we've                                 been doing is putting some stuff up on                                 github or is there another place that we                                 should be trying to put together to                                 share this kind of code between us                                 especially because I really like the                                 Mercy Corps fundraising page and like                                 I'd really like to see the code for that                                 yeah and I'd really like to share what                                 we have as well yeah I'm rather guts                                 that that's the question I mean so there                                 was a great bird of a feather session                                 yesterday that was exactly this is kind                                 of what it came into like is there's all                                 these examples how do we best share it                                 personally I think one of the the                                 challenges of sherry this from my own                                 personal experience one of the                                 challenges of sharing is once you've                                 worked on a website for six months or a                                 year or you get to the end of a project                                 the last thing you want to do is write a                                 case study and then write everything                                 that you did and get to use like you're                                 ready for the next thing and we don't                                 take the time so whatever we can do to                                 really shorten the sharing of it maybe                                 when the site's not even complete but                                 we've completed like I use these four                                 modules and I and it does this discreet                                 bit of functionality and there's some                                 type of repository for it or something                                 the bird of the feather session you know                                 some people volunteered to make a                                 website to do that I think that's a good                                 that will be great I think in a                                 short-term Drupal for good deed on do                                 you know dude groups google work is                                 probably the way to go and I think we                                 just need to make it a you know organ we                                 we need to embody that it is essential                                 you know that it's not that is not a                                 it's not a voluntary thing or an                                 optional thing so other ideas that                                 people came up with that I think are                                 really good is either putting a link                                 inside your on your website somewhere                                 that just says if you want the code and                                 you could link at least find out who the                                 developer are I mean half this project                                 was finding out who developed these                                 sites I mean it was hard to find out the                                 most minimum thing that we can do is put                                 something in your source code so when                                 you view source you can see who built                                 the site and where to go get more                                 information and that's what we're doing                                 you know starting tomorrow we're                                 starting today I mean it's like that I                                 think that's the the easiest simplest                                 thing we can do so thank you oh great                                 okay awesome so the domains already                                 going to happen and there's there was a                                 it was Drupal for nonprofits com or ok                                 and then wasn't there out of the Boff                                 there was a shared document that was                                 going to be created with people that                                 want to be part of this conversation                                 does that remember anyone remember the                                 bit ly URL                                 okay MP okay                                                          Paul organ bof it's one or the other                                 we'll figure it out maybe someone could                                 GU you know look it up right now NP oh                                 ok that's how it is mpo buff ok yes all                                 right um thank you that was a great                                 presentation I I guess what I'm                                 gathering is you put together your case                                 studies not by they weren't posted on                                 drupal.org all of these or you had to                                 research yeah yeah yeah yeah it would                                 have been so much easier if there were                                 no well I mean so I'll make this I'll                                 make this accessible to and share it but                                 i hope next time that there's just                                 hundreds that we could pull from and do                                 this so you may not know the answer to                                 this question but the Oxfam site that                                 you showed do you know if that was                                 drupal commons or organic groups it was                                 it wasn't it was i think initially that                                 they were actually going to do it on not                                 commons but what was the open atrium I                                 mean was a it was before Commons and                                 then I think they bumped up against                                 where comments or atrium would it work                                 and so they ended up just doing a custom                                 I mean using Drupal                                                   their own modules for it ok                                 configuration it was done by chapter                                   and actually like I said there's a video                                 about how they did it from the last                                 drupalcon and it's great cool ok thank                                 you yeah toy hi two quick things first I                                 was wondering if he knew the the name of                                 the module that I think it was the                                     group did at the very beginning yeah the                                 events module that you mentioned yeah it                                 was i think it's called d events it was                                 done by where corp right over here                                 you want to talk about it you guys and                                 in didn't flatter you guys yeah why you                                 come up so this is actually a set of                                 modules which include built upon views                                 and cck for Drupal                                               functionality was done using hive maps                                 library it's open source as well as far                                 as I know great thank you so much and                                 the other quick thing i had just I just                                 wanted to comment I was kind of                                 surprised to see Amnesty International                                 there because I worked there and I just                                 wanted to comment that we also I work                                 for the u.s. section which is slightly                                 different than the one that you yeah                                 this is the international study area                                 yeah the is so the u.s. section also                                 about a year ago we recently migrated                                 over from a kind of really rough                                 in-house CMS to a Drupal                                                worked with a Jackson river on that with                                 a very successful migration everything                                 was really great so I just also wanted                                 to through the Dawson's that's awesome                                 Jackson river rocks hi yeah there's one                                 more comment I think about the last                                 question yeah I'm leaf utne with where                                 Corp I work with Vitaly I just wanted to                                 mention that the work that we did for                                                                                                        is pretty heavily customized and we                                 would love to abstract that and release                                 it to the wild so that other people can                                 use it but there's a chunk of work that                                 has to happen so if you're interested in                                 working with us on that let me know i'm                                 working in organizations and consulting                                 i find that most of nonprofits are it's                                 pretty easy to sell them on drupal but I                                 keep waiting to have that person or that                                 organization that just doesn't get it                                 and I was wondering if in your research                                 you've come across any consistent                                 concerns or whatever that organizations                                 had had about wishing to Drupal and what                                 they what they might be rather grees                                 nailed it yesterday when he said the                                 authoring interface emits if I mean                                 let's be honest i mean if if drupal had                                 the authoring interface that was as                                 simple as WordPress they would just                                 you know all these administrators would                                 adopt it but it's a little clunky if                                 you're not familiar with it it's                                 actually a great interface for site                                 builders you know but when you're when                                 you're an administrator of a site it's a                                 little scary and I think that's one of                                 the things that puts people off a lot of                                 the old concerns around security of open                                 source and you know the scale of the                                 community are have kind of been resolved                                 the other big challenge that you that if                                 people have done the deep dive into it                                 will bring up is yes it's portable yes I                                 don't have vendor lock-in yes I have it                                 it's free but i can't find good rupal                                 support you know there's not enough good                                 people out there that are willing to                                 work on the site for us or at least on                                 nonprofit rates I mean we're lucky at                                 civic actions have the luxury of working                                 on larger scale non-profit sites that do                                 have you know pretty big budgets you                                 know or that could dedicate resources                                 and it's a it's a valid concern and it's                                 part of the call to action here too                                 which is we really need to bring more                                 people in the community that want to be                                 working on these types of world-changing                                 projects quickly and if we do have that                                 community built I think that the                                 nonprofit community will adopt Drupal                                 really quickly our foundation doesn't                                 accept donations online but we are                                 primarily engaged in raising awareness                                 for international issues and we're not                                 advocates and we are trying very hard                                 not to be you know in the advocacy game                                 so I guess my real issue with using                                 Drupal as a nonprofit is what are the                                 the key ingredients that you would                                 recommend we adopt you know say whatever                                 emerging technology there is modules or                                 whatever to build a successful community                                 of experts people that can help                                 us start that dialogue it's a good                                 question it's I find it hard often to                                 say this is the right technology                                 solution with just a little bit of                                 information I think it's it's it if you                                 really need to get a little bit deeper                                 dive and understand your community one                                 of the things obviously is not everyone                                 wants to go to a website to share                                 information all right so sometimes                                 communities and we're finding this we we                                 we branch out a little bit beyond Drupal                                 because we do other emerging                                 technologies sometimes it's better to do                                 technology that facilitates face-to-face                                 stuff sometimes people are more                                 comfortable having working groups using                                 conference calls that are scheduled by                                 websites there's a lot of cool stuff                                 that's happening in the in the audio                                 space I mean I really think that's the                                 frontier of Technology I could say a                                 whole lot more about that but you know                                 I'm happy to talk with you offline i                                 mean the short answer is i mean there's                                 a lot of good internet stuff duple                                 commons is a good you know way to get                                 started right away drupal organic groups                                  obviously is awesome and really scalable                                  to do a lots of different things I don't                                  know anyone else have any thoughts                                  around quick wins around her particular                                  requirements yeah so let's talk more                                  about it after session and we can see                                  what about your community so I wanted to                                  ask about sort of advocacy modules writ                                  large because I think nonprofits using                                  Drupal benefit from a lot of the work                                  that shops working for for-profit                                  companies do yeah but advocacy modules                                  are sort of specific to you know                                  nonprofit and social change sites yeah                                  and I remember                                  I first started using Drupal in like                                                                                                          oriented stuff that had come out of Dean                                  space and civic space yeah I think there                                  was like a letter to the editor module                                  it was like a petition module and there                                  were like a few other ones and since                                  then it feels like there hasn't been a                                  lot of support or development there like                                  there have been some things developed                                  but then they got abandon or there been                                  things developed but they didn't get                                  contributed back and so like a lot of                                  the nonprofit's that I've worked with                                  that are on Drupal are using salsa or                                  convey or some other yep third party                                  system yeah so I just wondering what                                  your thoughts were sort of the state of                                  all that from a from a from one                                  perspective like back in                                               the civic space teens civic space Drupal                                  five days when there was a lot of custom                                  module development it seemed that people                                  were writing lots of custom modules that                                  did specific things when when the whole                                  moved to c ck views and kind of                                  compiling sites and not doing custom                                  module development which was an awesome                                  innovation for the Drupal community I                                  what I found was there was more that                                  piece Mealing together solutions and                                  less of specific modules to do                                  functionality around advocacy there's                                  also on the other side of it you would                                  see groups like trel in which also does                                  some good nonprofit work I didn't                                  demonstrate any other stuff here but you                                  know great people and they you know they                                  used to maintain something called the                                  events Mont earth event finder and it                                  was a pretty hairy awesome modules doing                                  some with similar stuff to this and and                                  then when the architecture Drupal change                                  they didn't they couldn't really support                                  that module any longer so this is really                                  where I think that the call for us to                                  share how we're doing things because a                                  lot of these solutions like what                                         and where Corp is sharing it                                  is it was really a combination of four                                  different modules a recipe to put it                                  together some strategic stuff around it                                  we need to understand what that is                                  because it's not just a one-click                                  install download inhabit and and I think                                  the more sharing of what how we're                                  building sites is what we need yeah                                  great thank you I think we have like a                                  couple minutes two minutes and then                                  we're done hi Leah computers about the                                  use of mobile phones can you speak a                                  little that I wonder if you could tell                                  us a little more about use of mobile                                  phones uh-huh you know profit whether                                  you seen over how but I'm not that                                  spreading no way we're here yeah in                                  other fields I think we all know like                                  the major trends that are happening                                  mobile right and i missed the keynote                                  this morning but i know essentially what                                  it's about it's like we got to think                                  about mobile first and i think it's                                  nonprofits we need to think about that                                  we have I mean first and foremost you                                  know we need to be thinking about                                  responsive design clearly for most                                  nonprofits they don't need apps but for                                  a lot of the things that were                                  demonstrated here we might be able to                                  extrapolate and think about in a mobile                                  perspective so if I join a Greenpeace                                  group what's the group near me what r                                  where r other members how can i get                                  connect it with folks and then obviously                                  i mean here's my hunch and i know some                                  people are working on this a lot of them                                  there's a there's a big wave of                                  technology that's coming out of the                                  occupy movement and the occupy movement                                  is i mean i think there's going to be a                                  spring of occupy you know like after                                  this hibernation period and there's                                  going to be a lot of cool technology and                                  i think like SMS drupal thinking about I                                  mean most teenagers don't use email                                  they're using SMS and Facebook and that                                  type of                                  stuff and they interact differently and                                  we're going to think about how do we                                  know it's not even mobile first but                                  almost like mobile only is the way we                                  need to start thinking about this stuff                                  repurposing this stuff I think that's                                  probably what we're going to be talking                                  about next year I mean all the case                                  studies are going to be what are the                                  innovative ways that we're using mobile                                  in order to bring communities together                                  so great question I hope we all start                                  sharing that I don't I don't know the                                  answer yet yeah i think is the last                                  question this is actually kind of just a                                  comment yeah I'll make that I'm sorry                                  just let's like there's a quick thing so                                  I'm gonna make my slide you could always                                  get me and then I'm going to there's a                                  session page and i'm going to upload my                                  slides after the session so you could                                  get all my slides okay so go ahead I'm                                  sorry to interrupt thank you for                                  uploading those this is kind of just a                                  comment i work for a fairly small web                                  design company in a very small town in                                  Indiana and we tend to focus a lot of                                  our belt development on nonprofits that                                  are locally based and to try to kind of                                  help offset some of the cost when they                                  come in and they you know want this                                  really special feature that may require                                  either you know a lot of very specific                                  development if the feature doesn't                                  really preview previously exists or if                                  we haven't worked with it is will build                                  community sites that we kind of just do                                  to contribute to our local community                                  like a brainstorming side or something                                  like that yeah and then we'll with you                                  know the awesomeness of the
