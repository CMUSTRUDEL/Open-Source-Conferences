Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: OPEN STANDARDS AND DOCUMENT ORIENTED STORAGE
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	Among the goals of Drupal8 is support for UUID's which seems to be well under way. Another topic of interest are further advances in supporting any kind of storage layer, specifically those emerging under the NoSQL umbrella. In this context there are two standards that are of interested: PHPCR and CMIS. PHPCR defines a standardized API for CMS storage with multiple implementations already under way, that heavily draws from the JCR standard. CMIS on the other hand standardizes a communication protocol. Both solutions also define import/export standards which at the very least could help in letting users more easily migrate their data, between servers. But also migrate from JCR/CMIS compatible solutions of which there exists many open source and proprietary products. The goal if this core conversation is to explore the relevance of these standards for Drupal. http://phpcr.github.com/slides.html
