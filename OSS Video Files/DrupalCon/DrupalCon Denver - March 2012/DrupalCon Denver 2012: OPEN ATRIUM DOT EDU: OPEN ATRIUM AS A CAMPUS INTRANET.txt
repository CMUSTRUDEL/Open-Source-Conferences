Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: OPEN ATRIUM DOT EDU: OPEN ATRIUM AS A CAMPUS INTRANET
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	Open Atrium is an excellent install profile for small teams and project management -- but with a few tweaks, it can be retrained as a powerful and beautiful intranet for universities and other large organizations. Cal State Monterey Bay has successfully put all 6000 daily users and tens of thousands of applicants in a single Open Atrium site, and used a combination of features overrides, custom spaces, and Open Atrium's own APIs to make it our own.

We gave a similar presentation at BADCamp 2011, and everyone loved it. This time we'll delve deeper into the code and go over some new modules we will be releasing to help other institutions get started.

Questions answered by this session: 
How can I alter Open Atrium so it serves thousands of users well?
What are the usability problems with Open Atrium, and how can I overcome them?
What administrative and end-user interfaces need to be built to handle thousands of private and public groups?
How can I tread softly on someone else's install profile without breaking upgrades?
What governance model can a campus use to make an awesome intranet?
