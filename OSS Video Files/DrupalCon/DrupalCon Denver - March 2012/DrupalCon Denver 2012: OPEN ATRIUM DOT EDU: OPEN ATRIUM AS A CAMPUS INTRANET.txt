Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: OPEN ATRIUM DOT EDU: OPEN ATRIUM AS A CAMPUS INTRANET
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	Open Atrium is an excellent install profile for small teams and project management -- but with a few tweaks, it can be retrained as a powerful and beautiful intranet for universities and other large organizations. Cal State Monterey Bay has successfully put all 6000 daily users and tens of thousands of applicants in a single Open Atrium site, and used a combination of features overrides, custom spaces, and Open Atrium's own APIs to make it our own.

We gave a similar presentation at BADCamp 2011, and everyone loved it. This time we'll delve deeper into the code and go over some new modules we will be releasing to help other institutions get started.

Questions answered by this session: 
How can I alter Open Atrium so it serves thousands of users well?
What are the usability problems with Open Atrium, and how can I overcome them?
What administrative and end-user interfaces need to be built to handle thousands of private and public groups?
How can I tread softly on someone else's install profile without breaking upgrades?
What governance model can a campus use to make an awesome intranet?

everybody so                               welcome to open atrium edu using open                               atrium as a campus intranet I'm Kevin                               Millar from Cal State Monterey Bay the                               little second-youngest Monterey CSU                               campus so cal state system campus and i                               just threw this sliding because i just                                learned this about an hour ago but we                                just did a lot of research so if you're                                interested on how you name your portal                                we found that out of                                                    found on campuses because edgy cause

                  the past and how we got to the point of                                using open atrium actually before i                                begin let's just get a feel of the room                                how many of you know what open atrium is                                okay how many of you used open atrium                                okay how many you've installed open                                atrium okay how many of you like how you                                can add the debt how many like how many                                of you like the dashboard editing                                experience in open atrium okay so cal                                state monterey bay this is just a brief                                overview so we're a young campus we have                                a central I tissot RIT our web team is                                myself as web developer Greg pool who's                                in the front here who's our lead and we                                have a another employee Isaac whose                                works from Portland and who does a lot                                of administrative stuff so a really                                small team and we really started with a                                portal on our campus using a product                                called you portal which I know a lot of                                campuses use we could never really get                                it successfully off the ground you                                portals of java java environment                                yeah so it requires that expertise and                                we didn't have it in our campus and it                                was just kind of ugly and it didn't                                really work we deployed it for                                internally for our IT department but we                                never rolled it out to the rest of the                                campus and however we then we were faced                                with a few things a few big changes in                                our campus first of all we were                                switching from first class which i still                                have weird memories of to google apps                                for education for all of our email and                                things like that at the same time we                                were also switching student information                                systems from banner to PeopleSoft and so                                we had to have a place for people to                                start to get their email on the web to                                use cast authenticates they can                                authenticate once into some place and                                then go off to email to student                                information system etc and so we it was                                clear that we needed a portal and at the                                time we had kind of a skunk works                                project going on making a portal at the                                time in Drupal                                                         the name of the predecessor to home box                                i think it was like start page or                                something like that and a bunch of                                iframes so it was I frames into little                                applications that were accessing                                information and so we deployed that on                                our campus we ran it for about two years                                it was pretty successful but it didn't                                have a lot of flexibility and we only                                spent like a month on it so we did a lot                                of user testing we did help everything                                we didn't do in the beginning and did                                actual user testing usability studies                                sitting down with students did a big                                survey and upgraded it to using open                                atrium and the reason we did chose that                                as our team and I think other campuses                                should think about as well when faced                                with using Drupal natively or open                                atrium as a intranet is that open atrium                                gives gave us a whole lot of things out                                of the box so we didn't have to reinvent                                the wheel                                so the again the first thing big thing                                that was driving people to using the                                portal was was google it was also our                                student information system that's my                                feeling about it so portals on a campus                                usually are started by a single client                                who has a big voice about what they want                                and not not necessarily all the time but                                almost all RFQs rfps by higher ed never                                have use abilities or experience or just                                 being plain pretty to look at as                                 requirements so and I apologize in                                 advance if you any of you are at these                                 universities but I'm just going to                                 quickly show you some portals so you'll                                 start seeing like a pattern                                 I could go really really fast                                 so the portal it's basically a lot of                                 boxes with stuff in it it's not very                                 dynamic somebody's is down apparently                                 you know like outlets CNN I like this                                 one browser alert using Chrome and I                                 don't even it's like chrome one so                                 portals oftentimes is one person who's                                 like the Dean of Students or the                                 registrar or whatever and they're like I                                 want a place that's basically the just                                 my little stuff and that's all I want so                                 what ends up happening is portals just                                 become a collection of portlets which is                                 a lot of portal systems column portlets                                 which is basically either iframes into                                 other enterprise systems they don't like                                 really integrate very well with the                                 interface and a lot of times the portals                                 are like you saw with like some of the                                 CNN example etc like jar with the rest                                 of the page layout and ultimately it                                 just makes really i'm not very beautiful                                 to look at and you also have our face                                 with a lot of integration with the                                 student information system so dealing                                 with that with other perp right so you                                 have like your proprietary i don't know                                 if anyone likes their student                                 information system but you have their                                 proprietary sis usually with its own                                 little way of working with other systems                                 and then you have this proprietary                                 portal and unless it's like something                                 like peoplesoft portal which is the sis                                 and the portal at the same time but then                                 you're stuck in peoplesoft land getting                                 it to integrate with the portal is very                                 difficult and so we found by i'll go                                 over the tricks we use by using a few                                 tricks to expose our student information                                 system in a restful sort of web standard                                 way we were then able to be like up                                 Drupal is totally good we can use feeds                                 we can use you know standard rest                                 environment to get all that data you're                                 also faced with most campuses that the                                 portal becomes a committee project                                 so I ain't named these guys I one of my                                 stuff he is home page him because that's                                 typically what happens in a sort of                                 standard committee environment is people                                 are like I just want my thing on the                                 dashboard and you can't customize it                                 what we heard from our students in our                                 first iteration of portal before we                                 moved to open atrium half of the screen                                 was customizable by them the other half                                 wasn't and we heard loud and clear from                                 students the number one thing well the                                 number one thing they wanted was that                                 the portal at the time was ugly and they                                 wanted it to be pretty number two thing                                 was I want to be able to change the                                 colors and number three was I don't like                                 all the crap from the Registrar on the                                 left-hand side I you know they've                                 emailed me to                                                            want to have complete control so                                 registering note those requirements as                                 identified from the user and having that                                 jive with a committee that owns the                                 portal is probably very difficult on                                 most campuses on our campuses luck                                 campus luckily were small we don't have                                 that kind of problem and typically again                                 most portal implementations have a                                 vendor involved and a vendor based                                 solutions or that are oftentimes                                 difficult to integrate so open atrium                                 and I'm just going to have a few more                                 slides and then actually show you the                                 things we've done with open atrium so                                 again we used chose open atrium because                                 it got us ninety percent of the way                                 there came with a dashboard it came with                                 organic groups which our prior version                                 was already using organic groups to                                 replace functionality that wasn't in                                 google apps but we had a gnarled first                                 class system which was the ability for                                 people to have communications so we were                                 like open atrium gets us ninety percent                                 of the way there we would quickly found                                 out however that there's a whole lot of                                 things in open atrium because it just                                 kind of comes with everything we had to                                 either turn off or tweak in order to                                 pour it to actually work as a normal                                 campus would expect it to work and also                                 so we had a lot of challenges things                                 like on everybody's campus you                                 authenticate with                                 i D that idea is not your real name that                                 ID is you know you don't walk up to                                 people and this is not my ID because I'm                                 not that dumb to share that but you                                 don't walk out to people and say hey my                                 name is no                                                          shouldn't normally with most things like                                 casts or ldap authentication in Drupal                                 it just sets the username as the                                 authentication name so we used the real                                 name module which allows you to do a                                 theme override of usernames so it can be                                 any other field so we have a field and                                 they're in their content profile for                                 first name field for last name those are                                 set by our our ldap server when a user                                 logs in but the problem is if you have a                                 module like I'm sorry this Denver                                 altitudes like destroyed my usually                                 supple soft jazz boys so I'll be                                 drinking water everyone's well how do                                 people live it this altitude so so                                 modules that I will rename and be named                                 anonymous but it's it's well it's it's a                                 case tracker modules like case tracker                                 and open atrium actually don't                                 appropriately themed the username before                                 outputting it just literally puts in                                 user the name parameter of the user so                                 we had to override a ton of forms and a                                 ton of views exposed filters in order to                                 actually show a person's real name and                                 make those things a behave appropriately                                 so we actually just committed a module                                 two days ago called atrium real name we                                 put it in the atrium features group I'll                                 show that to you later so we're starting                                 to commit some of this stuff into                                 contribs so right now you can't actually                                 download atrium real name it's basically                                 a huge collection of form overrides and                                 things like that                                 open atrium because it uses kata spaces                                 dashboard basically there's a dashboard                                 context for every type of space which                                 can be site-wide user or in a group the                                 problem is this by default it's kind of                                 like the default dashboard the our users                                 don't need that many dashboards they                                 just want their homepage that's their                                 customizable dashboard which normally is                                 their their user dashboard they don't                                 care about the other site wide context                                 dashboard which is the one that's                                 usually just set by an administrator so                                 we had to and we're almost done with                                 taking our stuff and making a                                 contributor to commit a atrium home                                 module that basically lets you get a                                 home button because we found a lot of                                 times and testing users when they were                                 in a group when you click on dashboard                                 that was the dashboard in that group not                                 your own dashboard and they were like                                 it's the same icon and it doesn't make                                 any sense and so that was a very it was                                 seemed like a simple fix but because of                                 the way spaces works ended up being more                                 complicated we also in our prior                                 instance our prior portal where we had                                 organic groups there were because there                                 was no interest in on the part of                                 anybody to kind of vet groups because we                                 didn't want to be in the position of                                 saying you you're not a group you don't                                 you know you're legalized marijuana                                 group doesn't get to you know have a                                 right to exist what happened was we just                                 let people make as many groups as they                                 wanted and those groups could be public                                 or private or controlled and it caused a                                 big problem because we ended up with                                 like                                                                   that                                                                   or five thousand private groups that                                 people were creating to do things like                                 manage a shared class project or                                 something which is fine but that we had                                 set too many public groups so it caused                                 a problem where people were like                                 which legalized marijuana group should I                                 join or what have you so we needed to                                 introduce way an atrium to restrict                                 users to only being able to create                                 private groups and then we just had a                                 simple Google Doc form that they could                                 fill out to say hey could you make my                                 group available and all we do is make                                 sure you're not duplicating existing                                 group functionality so and i'll get back                                 to the slide later but there's some more                                 stuff to share with you about later to                                 learn more about open atrium so now i'm                                 going to jump into the demo and hope                                 that the Wi-Fi works so first i'm going                                 to show you our port so oh my god i have                                 a hold so the first one another great                                 functionality that we added to open                                 atrium i'm going to go full screen here                                 is we use for the private message module                                 so every time I kind of go over a future                                 I'll go over how we with the recipe                                 basically of how we did this so in open                                 atrium this guy right here is called the                                 palette so any block that you set in the                                 palette region will be displayed as a                                 modal dialog we added some additional                                 functionality for basically create                                 opening those and automatically when the                                 users views a page and add an overlay                                 div that makes it dark gray so those are                                 the only two things we added and will be                                 contributing those back as soon as we                                 can but this is a block that shows we're                                 using private message module and private                                 message tag module so we have basically                                 a view of a user's messages tagged as                                 important what that allows us to do is                                 send like a message to all students a                                 message to all faculty because you can                                 use vuze bulk operations with private                                 message so you can send a message to all                                 users of a role sometimes we get a list                                 of ID's from our student information                                 folks saying hey                                 you send this message to students like                                 saying you have a hold you have to do                                 for you you know deal with this promptly                                 and the nice thing about these messages                                 is this appears right when you log in                                 you can't even get to your email so it's                                 even more jarring than like yet another                                 email in your inbox and they really                                 stand out so we just use private message                                 private message tags and views in order                                 to do this so that way the view of your                                 unread messages of your unread urgent                                 messages is in the palette region and if                                 it's empty then it doesn't display so                                 I'm going to close that the other thing                                 you'll notice is I have pretty flowers                                 on my dashboard so we've created a                                 there's my scenes okay we created a way                                 to create basically sub themes of the                                 geek ginko theme but we created one                                 called photo Iser which is basically a                                 sub-theme of the ginkgo theme with some                                 custom node type so that our folks in                                 our marketing department can upload                                 photographs so we created a theme called                                 watershed because we have a watershed                                 Institute it's right across the street                                 from our office where they have a lot of                                 native plants so every time you know you                                 load the page slowly over the Wi-Fi you                                 get a different picture about the                                 watershed or we have one about history                                 of Monterey called sepia and it and we                                 you can click and see the big picture we                                 can add like the captions of cypress                                 trees of Monterey or what have you we're                                 actually working on making one for like                                 athletics etc we have some fun ones this                                 is a nice called candy we even I'm going                                 to just attempt to wireless here                                 created this one this is fun                                 so this was our number one most                                 requested feature was I want I want to                                 be able to customize my dashboard and so                                 this is like you can click on the clouds                                 and they disappear the Sun comes up if                                 you click on six of them can play pong                                 so that was the most commented on                                 feature to master i'm going to go back                                 to the water shake is pretty so those                                 are basic sub-teams of ginkgo almost all                                 of them are just CSS you know this is                                 create a new folder put in some nice CSS                                 you can give your users a ton of options                                 another feature that we added is what we                                 call links so there's a lot and a lot of                                 campuses you have a ton of enterprise                                 resources that may or may not integrate                                 with anything and you need to provide                                 simple links to get to those the problem                                 is that users want to be able to control                                 those because different types of people                                 have different needs so the users get by                                 default a list of links which they can                                 add to their dashboard as a nap if they                                 want or it's always available up here in                                 the links menu and these are just links                                 off to other resources I can customize                                 the list so i can add new other links so                                 if I worked for our corporation I dad                                 maybe timekeeping and training if I use                                 blogger a lot i could add blogger these                                 are only campus resources we did have                                 people say like I want you know Pandora                                 or whatever and we were like no because                                 then that gets in a slippery slope that                                 basically we create a link to any campus                                 resource broken down by who you might be                                 and you can add add them from here to                                 here you can drag them around and put                                 them in order etc                                 and we'll be expecting that as a feature                                 pretty soon we also created a group                                 called campus and used in events which                                 is just a private group we're a                                 privileged few can make posts because                                 now that users are able to customize                                 their dashboard to whatever they want we                                 do need a way to kind of communicate to                                 them that's not like a big alert pop-up                                 box but just like a here's what's going                                 on on campus and so we just all we did                                 was create a private group called campus                                 news and events and we made a view of                                 those posts in that group and then just                                 stick it on the top of the dashboard so                                 they can see that our student                                 information system is down as of today                                 these actually get a lot of reeds so                                 these on average between six or eight                                 hundred which is pretty good for a                                 campus of about                                                and you can see here there's that this                                 is the home module in action I don't                                 have a dashboard tab I may have a                                 dashboard tab if I'm in a group that i'm                                 a member of so right now in open atrium                                 if you install it let's go to me                                 krone has like                                                       probably unhappy                                 when you install open atrium by default                                 it uses the context do I tool to allow                                 you to customize the dashboard when you                                 do that it creates a lot of usability                                 problems because this thing floats over                                 the blocks that you're trying to move                                 it's really annoying and none of our                                 users liked it it made no sense                                 whatsoever so what we did instead was                                 just use a little bit of JavaScript and                                 little CSS to say when you click it                                 slide it over from the left-hand side we                                 also this is actually just you know                                 JavaScript override on a form so there's                                 some hidden radio buttons that are                                 clicked when you select the layout but                                 open atrium by default comes with three                                 layouts and their names mean nothing so                                 we made a little picture of three                                 columns has three columns to split                                 columns as their equal and a default is                                 like a wide in a and an arrow and I can                                 change them we had to warn them to                                 change layout so every time they make a                                 change it turns that red and it's the                                 basic stuff here we also had to when you                                 use open atrium by default all of the                                 categories of applications is by the is                                 created by the module exposing them so                                 if you make a lot of blocks and share                                 them on your dashboard using views for                                 example then it'll be like views as the                                 category that means nothing to the user                                 and we don't want them to see the word                                 atrium at all because even though it's                                 pretty word they don't need to know that                                 and so we just use we wrote a module                                 again coming out and contribute to just                                 reorder apps into categories like campus                                 information you know my information etc                                 so that's make another little usability                                 enhancement I'm going to treatment                                 because we touch a lot of enterprise                                 resources that may or may not be                                 available at any given moment or maybe                                 down we don't want to just use standard                                 Drupal blocks to expose that information                                 because it might slow down the page load                                 time so we used a module called                                     blocks which lets you basically do this                                 you'll see when I load my dashboard all                                 the blocks live by ajax the nice thing                                 it's using appropriate Aria roles here                                 so it is it is nicely accessible when                                 injecting the Dom correctly so for                                 example our campus dining app which is                                 basically just a different view of a                                 google calendar is can load on its own                                 time because the google calendar api                                 might be really slow we also introduced                                 and i'll show you how to do this towards                                 the end in atrium it's in spaces in                                 general it's relatively easy to create                                 new custom spaces so for example every                                 role every major role on campus like                                 faculty staff students I'll have a space                                 that's just for them and that's where we                                 do things like put applications that we                                 want them to be able to access that they                                 may or may not remove off their                                 dashboard because they're like I don't                                 care about you know my list of classes                                 but they know they can always get to it                                 in their students tab so in faculty and                                 staff I can see my employee ID which I                                 can share with the world because it                                 doesn't really do anything I can see my                                 major I can see remember the links that                                 i showed earlier the links that appear                                 here when you go to customize them it                                 shows a list of the links in available                                 to you we also put those links in the                                 tab for each major role so i only see                                 links here that are either campus                                 related or just related to my particular                                 role which is great because i'm a you                                 know only want to note use a Hyperion or                                 whatever                                 every once in a while and not want to                                 add it to my links and I can see you                                 know posts in a staff and faculty group                                 and in a minute I'll show you the                                 student view which is different actually                                 let's go do that right now so and these                                 are real students and applicants but I                                 changed their names and I did it using                                 the inspector in google chrome so I'm                                 not going to click around because then                                 you would see their name but I wanted to                                 show you some different experiences for                                 our portal so students staff faculty and                                 active alumni all get the same                                 experience it's pretty much what I                                 showed you they can join and create                                 groups etc the only people who can't do                                 that our applicants so we have                                          sixteen to seventeen thousand applicants                                 every semester and they are all                                 automatically provisioned an account                                 with the campus because they need to be                                 able able to log in and see what their                                 statuses etc but the problem is CMS                                 PeopleSoft doesn't really when you login                                 it's an empty screen it doesn't really                                 show you what your statuses and when you                                 get there the messages are very                                 confusing and make no sense so again in                                 this actually you can see we have a                                 different palette that we've constructed                                 here that says oh you forgot to set up                                 your forgot password questions so we                                 also have again just using standard                                 Drupal blocks and putting them in the                                 palette depending on what's going on                                 with the user we have one that says like                                 you haven't registered for emergency                                 alerts type in your your phone number so                                 you're registered and it these blocks                                 are so annoying is people log in they                                 actually pay attention to them pretty                                 quickly and it's going to close that so                                 here's a d applicant so the applicants                                 have a different dashboard and different                                 items that are available to them and you                                 can see here's their checklist which                                 most applicants they just want to log in                                 to see you know did you get everything                                 and I can see messages and these are                                 messages that are customized based on                                 what's going up on with their                                 application at that time so the ideas                                 they can log in and it's like hey your                                 conditional adnate here's what you need                                 to do you have some things you have to                                 fill out etc so rnr i'll show you in a                                 bit our admissions team are we're                                 basically using the rules module and a                                 custom rules filter to let them have a                                 UI that's like if the applicant has this                                 status and this reason and they're                                 applying in the spring semester show                                 this message or if they have this                                 checklist item that they haven't                                 completed and it's due in sixty six                                 weeks and it's a Sunday and we're                                 wearing red boxer shorts show them this                                 other checklist item so it's nice and                                 very flexible as a student here is Sarah                                 student this is a real students                                 dashboard so she's added for example                                 we're using Drupal's it comes with open                                 atrium the feeds module to suck over                                 some RSS feeds from our campus website                                 so that was very easy to make a view of                                 all feeds items that you users flagged                                 so when I can't click on that because                                 I'm not logged in I'll show you in a bit                                 but we we've used okay feeds to bring                                 over the data you've used to expose that                                 as a block and then let the user flag                                 the feed so they can flag you know I                                 want to subscribe to campus news to                                 information technology news etc so using                                 views and and flag you can let users                                 subscribe to different feed nodes and                                 then just populate a list of their                                 customized news so we can see she's a                                 member of several groups we have the                                 weather and a calendar we have a class                                 schedule which is by default on the top                                 of the users dashboard it's great for                                 new students especially because they can                                 go they can see you know the room and                                 it's in and then you know there's the                                 map where it's at and also we have a I                                 learn which is what we call moot it's                                 what we call Moodle on our campus so                                 sorry we call noodle I learn on our                                 so we used I learns API to show the user                                 a quick link straight to their Island                                 course and that's one of the most                                 heavily used features in mine and when                                 our student clicks the student tab you                                 can see we have some things that were                                 there already like her class schedule                                 because she may have removed it off her                                 dashboard but we also show her links to                                 for example our ASAP folks which is um                                 I've no idea what a SAP stands for but                                 it's they're advising our advising group                                 who now accept submissions via Google                                 Docs and leave notes on it and send it                                 back to the person so there's some extra                                 student services that are available in                                 the student tab which is actually the                                 third most trafficked web page on our                                 entire campus so they use it up a lot                                 they also have links to forms which is a                                 different system i won't go into it's                                 not Drupal or anything and then they get                                 their student links so that's a                                 different set of links then then what                                 staff see you can see and I'm going to                                 click on this is going to be very long                                 because we're doing network maintenance                                 so we've also using feeds a lot of                                 campuses have in IT infrastructure that                                 exposes system status or alerts about                                 what's going on on campus we have the                                 same thing and since its spring break                                 we're just unplugging everybody's                                 network and redoing everything so we                                 have a lot of alerts but using this                                 region up here is called the space tools                                 and you can use context to set a space                                 tool Block in that region so this is                                 just a few of alert items created in a                                 feed that where the start and end time                                 is between falls around now so you can                                 just use context to place a view into                                 the spaces region and you'll                                 automatically get a nice little list                                 that's the same thing that links is so                                 links is just a view of all flagged link                                 nodes you just drop it in the spaces use                                 some CSS to add a cute little icon and                                 you're done                                 so for four groups we did have to                                 construct our own group space very                                 similar to how you constructs students                                 staff and faculty space because the                                 default organic groups view is nice but                                 it doesn't work when you have a ton of                                 groups so it's relatively                                 straightforward to make a different                                 kinds of views for the list of a user's                                 groups and then just create a different                                 custom space so this spaces / groups as                                 opposed to / OG which is the organic                                 groups view so we can do things like                                 place a block letting users know how to                                 create a group allow people to view                                 groups by categories and even show like                                 recent posts in our news and events                                 another feature that a lot of people use                                 to discover groups is we're using this                                 cool module called radioactivity                                 radioactivity lets you wait content by a                                 wide variety of cats so you can say you                                 know content that's basically what we                                 call this on around campus is what's hot                                 what's going on on campus right now so                                 this is posts on any public group that                                 has the most reads or the most comments                                 etc so radioactivity lets you add                                 basically energy to a node so if a                                 person views it it gets a little bit of                                 energy if they comment on it gets more                                 energy and then you set a half life so                                 that it gets energy but then after a day                                 it gets it gets cut in half so you don't                                 have like the most common node from                                 twelve years ago on the top so a lot of                                 users use this to look at what's going                                 on in different groups                                 there's also an excellent module out                                 there called atrium Gantt chart which                                 when I'm in a really low resolution so                                 things are running over so we did                                 install the ideation module which allows                                 you to create ideas and filter ideas no                                 one's put an idea in this group I                                 thought they did so it's basically a way                                 to collect ideas about a project so                                 we're doing an upgrade to a system on                                 campus our users can put in information                                 about like I'd like to see this great                                 feature I mean people can vote on it and                                 that's a module that's available right                                 now we didn't write it somebody else did                                 you can install it and it turns that                                 feature on automatically but you can use                                 Gantt chart to make Gantt charts on                                 cases so this is basically gives you                                 like a planner view so i don't like                                 Gantt charts but some managers is a                                 slight freak out when they see that so                                 there's a module called jayus gant in                                 drupal org that lets you create Gantt                                 chart views basically so it gives you a                                 different display for your views and                                 that renders the mountain in pretty                                 little Gantt charts which does impress                                 certain types of people                                 oh and you may have noticed are you                                 online Greg so we how many of you have                                 heard of Oh lark ok I'm going to do a                                 quick like plug for a company that we                                 love and not just because it gave us a                                 t-shirt so Oh lark is basically when we                                 rolled out my CSUMB at the end of last                                 summer we knew we'd have a lot of                                 support questions we trained user not                                 trained but we had prepared them for the                                 move but we knew that there'd be a lot                                 of issues and questions so what we did                                 was we purchased a plan with a lark                                 that's ola RK and it basically there's a                                 module written by the all about folks                                 that lets you set an alert code on a                                 page based on context to rules so for                                 example i can go in at any time say oh                                 you know i can read the FAQ or i can say                                 hello i need help and it gives us live                                 chat the nice thing is it works with                                 Jabbar so you can use any jabber client                                 we can also do things like set custom                                 values for the user in the jabber client                                 so for example if I view a user who's                                 chatting with me for with a support                                 question I can see their name their                                 their campus ID if I need to look                                 something up about them I can see their                                 role so I can see if there's students                                 staff faculty and the the OL arc API                                 allows you to add very easily any                                 additional attributes you need from the                                 back end system I can even do you want                                 to show them see so if let's say for                                 example I say how how do i get home                                 this is one of those demo things that                                 like doesn't work half the time                                 so with ol arc you can initiate commands                                 so you can say push a user to a                                 different URL or what we're trying to                                 attempt here which you can say bang see                                 and it lets you see what the person sees                                 in their browser and circle items on the                                 screen so there's Greg's putting circle                                 on the page which is we usually ask                                 people's permission before the we do                                 this because it freaks them out but it's                                 really nice as a lot of time students                                 are like how do I find my student ID and                                 we're like 'oh click on student and here                                 it is they're like oh great i can't                                 believe i missed it so we really love ol                                 arc and highly suggest it we're actually                                 going to start rolling this out to our                                 student support people in general so                                 students can go on and say where's my                                 financial aid why can't I get into this                                 class etc                                 so at this point and click oh I can                                 click to remove them Wow sorry I just                                 discovered a new feature so some things                                 that we're working on right now even                                 this is a nice improved user experience                                 interface but it's not accessible and                                 actually we were presenting on this                                 project at Stanford and a fellow John                                 follow following below folio I got it                                 wrong both times he's really being an                                 accessibility was standing back there                                 watching me and he's like put his hand                                 up and like John you're going to ask                                 about accessibility and no this is not                                 accessible at all you cannot move boxes                                 using the keyboard and it sucks and he                                 just kind of nodded he's like it's that                                 accessible now so very we actually have                                 a patch in spaces in the spaces issue                                 queue as of Monday to fix this and the                                 way that we're proposing to fix it is                                 that in the context you I you can get an                                 alternate version which is essentially                                 exactly like the administrative block                                 interface that you are all know and love                                 but is nice and accessible because it                                 has off-screen but readable weight                                 values and everything's labeled properly                                 user it's it's even more useful for                                 people with cognitive disabilities you                                 might be able to see but have problems                                 placing boxes in exactly the right place                                 so we're hoping this will get put into                                 spaces dashboard if not we'll put on                                 another module to enable this and this                                 point I think we're pretty much oh so                                 yes code                                 and on our website the website for this                                 talk which is again CSUMB edu / drupal                                 you'll see on the bottom of the page a                                 link to resources for this talk we have                                 a link to a github gist with this code                                 but this is also available on the atrium                                 community site so for example we wanted                                 to let users do this like go off their                                 profile and click change theme which                                 this isn't available by default and also                                 we were using the cast module which uses                                 a different logout URL so there's a nice                                 handy hook called account links altar                                 which basically passes the links array                                 and you can add you know here we're                                 adding change theme as the fourth item                                 on the list so it's a very simple altar                                 hook we do have some blocks on our                                 dashboard that we don't want available                                 to users so for example as an                                 administrator I can you know look at you                                 run a test applicant checklist if an                                 applicant asked me a question about                                 their checklist I can put in their ID                                 and see what they see we don't want that                                 available of course and we also have                                 things that do other administrative                                 services so you can use hook dashboard                                 block access altar which is a spaces                                 hook that allows you to go through the                                 list of blocks that are available for                                 that space and unset them based on                                 whatever you want user permissions etc                                 we actually wrote our own custom UI form                                 to let us say this block is available to                                 these three roles and once we get it an                                 unconnected from all those other stuff                                 we wrote around it will try to commit it                                 atrium by default comes with some                                 standard blocks like the Welcome video                                 block that shouldn't be in things like                                 the dashboard for groups which we don't                                 let users edit their group dashboard                                 just because again for them they were                                 like it's I can edit this one and which                                 one's mine it was too confusing so we                                 just                                 made use a standard dashboard for every                                 group so using spaces preset alter you                                 can for example here remove the annoying                                 atrium welcome member block so this is                                 how we define things like the student                                 space or the group space etc which by                                 default right now for some of these                                 they're blank pages and they're just all                                 blocks set by context so they don't                                 they're not actually returning any data                                 although you could do that so you took                                 menu to define your url so here's a                                 student URL and we're putting it in the                                 in the features menu which puts it up                                 top in the in the buttons and you in                                 this example we're just using a simple                                 permission to say you know students can                                 access a student page but staff can't                                 and then there's a simple menu callback                                 that checks to see if the space exists                                 at all in context and if not it creates                                 it on the fly and then so when you                                 enable this module go there it'll be                                 empty but then you can go into qlc in                                 context this space available and you can                                 then add blocks however you want and                                 that's                                 pretty much it i think we're open to                                 questions now if you have questions                                 please go to the microphone or i could                                 do a little dance                                 I have a question for you can hear me                                 I barely but yeah hi I have a question                                 about search especially when you have                                 the real name and the username can                                 students search each other by name or                                 how does it work we're actually using an                                 Apache Solr for search we use it for all                                 of our products that were actually                                 there's a module called a train Apache                                 Solr that changes this form basically to                                 submit to Apache Solr as opposed to the                                 default search module we're also we also                                 are you circling my screen so so we also                                 wrote a view and there is a little bug                                 here with the pager i still haven't                                 looked at so by default apache solr                                 atrium gives you you know standard                                 search results filter by group and you                                 can see you know some of greg's post                                 came up towards the top but we also made                                 just a view block that took this                                 argument up here and did a search and                                 displayed it as a list of users which is                                 great because we can filter out users                                 like applicants which people shouldn't                                 say so where's the code for this because                                 I'd like to replace that screenshot you                                 did at Penn State which I'm from Penn                                 State                                 that I keep sending messages now back to                                 that yet so I mean this project took it                                 it was like two and a half to three                                 months so we were going really fast and                                 we weren't thinking about contributing                                 any evident I'm it was just about                                 getting it done before the end of the                                 summer so we're i'm in the process right                                 now of taking those pieces out of some                                 of those monster override modules and                                 breaking them into different specific                                 features so that's right now we have the                                 atrium real name module which is out and                                 i'm putting them all on the atrium                                 website which is community not open                                 atrium org                                 and under here it is he wears the                                 feature group awesome sacks already                                 walking this way yes so there's shot                                 there's a shop resources group in open                                 atrium in community open atrium com and                                 so every time we can commit these back                                 we'll be putting them into the future                                 directory making like sub profiles or                                 something like that would be kind of                                 hard because it's the d                                               that makes it more difficult and so I                                 think it's probably better to just make                                 because the some of these are features                                 that other organizations not just as                                 tyrants ed would want so it'd be                                 probably better to contribute them as                                 separate features and then at a certain                                 point in time say here's a collection of                                 modules that if you want to do this you                                 can download them all separately and                                 install them yes I wondered if you had                                 any problems managing line breaks and                                 paragraph breaks cuz that's been our                                  trickiest bug to work out with our                                  installation of a trian that's a good                                  question and I didn't go over this but                                  we actually are using and we use this on                                  our external website as well so we're                                  using the actually not the WYSIWYG                                  module that we're using just the                                  ckeditor module and there's a few                                  reasons for that that I won't go into                                  now but basically it gives us we can do                                  some extra javascript stuff too like                                  provide custom formats etc so we're                                  using a WYSIWYG editor because our users                                  will kill us if we didn't and we're also                                  using the WYSIWYG format module which                                  lets you do some additional clean up                                  when when displaying the pages and also                                  do things like say if the alt attribute                                  is missing on image don't show it which                                  we don't do in my but we do do for our                                  external website so the WYSIWYG filter                                  module is actually very helpful                                  especially to clean up any kind of craft                                  decode that                                  see we got it creates okay so you use                                  ckeditor in combination with WYSIWYG                                  filter correct thank you I've seen this                                  presentation before but I still want to                                  say congratulations you guys connecting                                  to so many administrative systems is a                                  real challenge I was wondering if you'd                                  consider sharing your features on a                                  feature server in an edu domain in                                  addition to that the dot-com domain                                  mentioned earlier I think that                                  definitely we could share him on a                                  future server we had our own for a while                                  I never just kind of got around to                                  putting stuff there I think it's still                                  good to have it on do because that                                  there's still that infrastructure there                                  the security stuff issues etc so yeah                                  I'd be totally open to have some of                                  these on a future server some of these                                  modules actually the atrium real name                                  module which is the only one that's                                  publicly available now is actually not a                                  feature it's more of a collection of                                  form altar hooks so I don't know how                                  people would feel about that but yeah if                                  there was some other central repo we                                  could definitely overcome doing that I'm                                  the other thing I was going to ask you                                  about is your Aria roles I'm thinking                                  that you're probably using already                                  landmark roles the most correct and do                                  you guys have a way to have the form                                  landmark                                  to incorporate that into drupal forms                                  because we ate we're also interested in                                  landmark roles but we haven't done that                                  we're actually just leveraging with Ajax                                  box does by default which is just the                                  because the only stuff that we had                                  concern about for accessibility via Ajax                                  was the sort of dynamic block loading so                                  you know we haven't looked at the form                                  stuff just because we continue to use                                  kind of quarter before forming a ps                                   thanks again for the presentation are                                  you open atrium are there any other                                  natural collaborations I'm glad so I                                  don't know if everyone here but he was                                  asking if we were working on other                                  projects for open source and hi red I'm                                  glad you asked so we're actually in the                                  prot

                     I'm logged into the CMS sorry I love                                  that we have Dolores we're at donner                                  login page ok I'm get a very good                                  question so I'm curious to know what                                  other systems were you looking at before                                  you started started decided to go with                                  open atrium and for any other                                  universities that are thinking about                                  using open atrium what would you                                  recommend not to do so it's a good                                  question so we did have experience like                                  I said with you portal and we couldn't                                  it just didn't it didn't go there and I                                  mean we did have experience with                                  PeopleSoft so we kind of knew what we                                  would get if we had chosen to use the                                  PeopleSoft portal which we didn't like                                  so we there was nothing that we yeah we                                  switched to google apps but there was                                  nothing that fit that gap but we never                                  kind of sat down and did a very thorough                                  investigation of other ones mainly not                                  mainly but partially because we work for                                  the state of California we have no more                                  money so don't send us requests for RFPs                                  because we don't have them but for                                  anybody thinking about using open atrium                                  in the future i think the the the big                                  challenge is getting some of the ux                                  stuff right and also in a lot of other                                  campuses that we've talked to there are                                  several campuses sister campuses in the                                  CSU that are wanting to go this route                                  their biggest challenges is not open                                  atrium itself but in getting their                                  existing enterprise resources to                                  actually talk in a coherent way to other                                  applications thank you so there is a                                  both going on at now basically at                                  two-fifteen in room                                               specifically i'm moving open atrium to                                  d                                                                         too we all should also have an open                                  atrium users group tomorrow at                                          room                                              do that in the bath list and I wasn't                                  using power power points so I couldn't                                  use the slide but if you I'd love it if                                  you gave feedback so the way you can do                                  that is if you go to drupalcon org                                  search for open atrium or what have you                                  find the session and click provide                                  feedback and and yeah let's get that                                  started now so yeah and will will be                                  around all week and feel free to ask us                                  questions thank you
