indeed we                                 did so this is what we ordered i believe                                 so                                                                  hundred sixty five gallons so we                                 actually had originally some coffee                                 plant in the afternoon but we were                                 chasing you from from our community                                 worked with the caterer to kind of moved                                 around a little bit to try to make lunch                                 a little bit better so I hope that you                                 all enjoyed the food so our Wi-Fi usage                                 on Tuesday there were about                                      consecutive users connected to the Wi-Fi                                 and that bandwidth on that day repeats                                 around the average of                                                 pretty pretty high on Tuesday we had                                 about                                                                 the Wednesday and actually broke that                                 hundred three we got                                              average transfer and then today until                                 about noon                                                             of people connected in and online and                                 did                                                                      about the design and the conference                                 center and all that in regards to our                                 environmental and social light impact so                                 the food all the food that was left over                                 was donated to a program called we don't                                 waste which donates to local charities                                 to make sure that that food gets out to                                 people that can use it leftover                                 materials were donated also all of the                                 signage that was produced is a hundred                                 percent biodegradable so really happy                                 about that                                 and I believe it some from effort and                                 part of the drupal associations                                 initiative to help create more of an                                 environmentally sound impact with these                                 events so look for more more information                                 on that and more more progress so one                                 last night on the environmental impact                                 we have a particular partner a                                 production company we work with called

                   doing this but by that time they're                                 already invested so they stick around                                 what would you all say it was fun but                                 you all say that it was worth it and                                 would you all say it was worth it okay                                 all right so it really is fun and it's                                 really rewarding and the last month you                                 think I hate this and then you're on                                 site and just the adrenaline just keeps                                 you going and you're really really proud                                 of what you've done I think any of these                                 people will tell you if you would like                                 to volunteer for a drupalcon that we                                 have in an upcoming city just go to the

                    we'd love to have you as a part of us so                                 with that being said I'd like to thank                                 all of you folks I'd like to thank

indeed we                                 did so this is what we ordered i believe                                 so                                                                  hundred sixty five gallons so we                                 actually had originally some coffee                                 plant in the afternoon but we were                                 chasing you from from our community                                 worked with the caterer to kind of moved                                 around a little bit to try to make lunch                                 a little bit better so I hope that you                                 all enjoyed the food so our Wi-Fi usage                                 on Tuesday there were about                                      consecutive users connected to the Wi-Fi                                 and that bandwidth on that day repeats                                 around the average of                                                 pretty pretty high on Tuesday we had                                 about                                                                 the Wednesday and actually broke that                                 hundred three we got                                              average transfer and then today until                                 about noon                                                             of people connected in and online and                                 did                                                                      about the design and the conference                                 center and all that in regards to our                                 environmental and social light impact so                                 the food all the food that was left over                                 was donated to a program called we don't                                 waste which donates to local charities                                 to make sure that that food gets out to                                 people that can use it leftover                                 materials were donated also all of the                                 signage that was produced is a hundred                                 percent biodegradable so really happy                                 about that                                 and I believe it some from effort and                                 part of the drupal associations                                 initiative to help create more of an

    all by name but you can see them up on                                 the screen here you guys why don't you                                 come on out with about                                               organizing since October                                             round of applause for all of these hooks                                 as well                                 so like I said I get paid these guys                                 don't and many of them put hundreds and                                 hundreds of hours in I write these roles                                 and responsibilities pages for people                                 who want to volunteer and I lie like a                                 rug about how much time you'll spend                                 doing this but by that time they're                                 already invested so they stick around                                 what would you all say it was fun but                                 you all say that it was worth it and                                 would you all say it was worth it okay                                 all right so it really is fun and it's                                 really rewarding and the last month you                                 think I hate this and then you're on                                 site and just the adrenaline just keeps                                 you going and you're really really proud                                 of what you've done I think any of these                                 people will tell you if you would like                                 to volunteer for a drupalcon that we                                 have in an upcoming city just go to the
