Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: A RESPONSIVE PROJECT PROCESS
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	You've read the articles, studied the books and experimented on your own with responsive web design. The first thing you do when visiting a newly-launched site is to resize your browser and smile with delight if the content responds to the size of the canvas. But have you considered what a responsive web means for your entire project process? We'll go beyond the ems, percentages and media queries by sharing how responsive design has affected how we approach and practice analysis, content, wireframes, design, testing and site delivery from a more holistic point of view.

Questions answered by this session: 
What are some practical ways I can adapt my process when designing responsively?
How does responsive design affect the deliverables I produce and show to clients?
How does partnering with an outside firm affect how we deliver responsive designs to clients?
How do I test effectively for the dozens of different screen resolutions?
How can we structure the site and guide the client so they don't break the layout when adding content post-launch?

	                              alright I think we're going to go ahead                               and get started good afternoon welcome                               to a responsive process basically I                               talked just sharing what i've learned on                               my own and with my company working on                               responsive web design projects and how                               that affects all the different parts of                               our process not just designed in front                               end but basically reaches out across all                                areas and that's what I wanted to share                                today a little bit about me my name is

                    pulling a great shot of espresso also                                the subtleties that come with various                                different roasts and we have a lot of                                great coffee houses around DC to which I                                enjoy visiting with my wife I'm a huge                                sports fan mainly football

I've just been able to see it                                changed people's lives growing up in                                different areas sure sorry about that so                                I love technology and I think that's                                kind of what led me into the                                professional min today designing                                primarily on the web but also different                                mediums as well with the advance of the                                personal computer desktop publishing and                                things like that                                so a responsive process why another talk                                on responsive design I know we've had a                                few that have touched on this already                                here at drupalcon and there's seems like                                there's a new article being published                                every day someone's blogging about a new                                technique they're using whether it be                                Ethan Mark cuts great book on the                                subject which I would definitely                                recommend reading if you haven't already                                or the various people which is                                publishing new thoughts on it every day                                I feel like there's a lot of information                                out there and a lot of good resources on                                techniques and how to implement things                                but there's not really a lot of info on                                how it affects the rest of our process                                designed in front front-end development                                are very important and myself as a                                designer definitely recognize that but                                responsive web design affects a lot of                                different things that affects time lens                                or projects it impacts the type of                                content we write how we write that                                content how does a responsive affect the                                deliverables that we produce and what we                                show to clients all these different                                areas that I'm going to touch on today                                and just relate what we've learned                                working on different projects why is                                mobile such a big thing why are we doing                                responsive if you went to the keynote                                this morning you saw even more                                statistics than this on how important                                mobile is how quickly it's growing how                                many people are using and accessing your                                websites and your clients websites just                                using a mobile device not necessarily                                the desktop PC they have at work or at                                home and this is only going to continue                                to grow so we need to be prepared for                                this it's a really fun technique to                                design for and plan for but it's also                                beneficial for our clients as well a lot                                of you are even taking notes today on                                devices that didn't even exist two years                                ago things like smartphones and tablets                                that weren't even on the market yet and                                yet we're using them today as our                                primary device or a secondary device and                                this is only going to keep growing and                                spreading                                mobile devices are going to overtake PC                                devices in the next few years is the                                most popular way to access the web and                                responsive design prepares us for this                                for this growth market and it's                                beneficial to our clients because we're                                setting them up to be prepared for the                                future as well but when we get down to                                it it's not just about these devices                                 it's about the people behind them it's                                 not about the glowing rectangles it's                                 the people looking at them or into them                                 or touching them or interacting with                                 them or also our desktop users as well                                 and not just small screens but larger                                 screens behind all of these there's                                 actual people using these devices and                                 that's really who we should be designing                                 for Charles Ian says that the role the                                 designer is that of a very good                                 thoughtful host all of whose energy goes                                 into trying to anticipate the needs of                                 his guests they're not spoken                                 specifically towards responsive design I                                 think this captures pretty well the                                 opportunity we have as creators and                                 builders on the web to serve our                                 audience in an impactful way that takes                                 their needs into account I think if you                                 are having someone over for dinner who                                 grew up in a different culture who has                                 different dietary needs if you're a good                                 host you're going to recognize that and                                 plan for that and when they come when                                 they come over you're going to serve                                 them according to their needs that's                                 kind of what we're doing with responsive                                 how our users interact with our sites                                 the context that they're in when they're                                 viewing our projects our client sites                                 this is all things we need to keep in                                 mind and not just worry about what                                 breakpoints we're going to use or what                                 devices we're going to cater to remember                                 that there's people behind these devices                                 this actually helps our users responsive                                 web design does it's not just for the                                 approval of our peers so when we launch                                 a site that is responsive they can go                                 and resize their browser and oh and AH                                 and they can send us a congratulatory                                 tweet I mean it's always nice to get                                 good feedback but if we're just doing it                                 because it's the new cool thing to do I                                 think we're taking the wrong approach                                 and we're missing a really good                                 opportunity as well                                 so being a good host to the guest of                                 your design to your site to your clients                                 project what does our process look like                                 we're the traditional process look like                                 usually go something like this depending                                 on the size your company or the people                                 you have gathering requirements doing                                 some type of I a planning getting the                                 client to agree to that then moving on                                 to UX and wire framing get them to sign                                 off on that they move on to design                                 usually producing comps in Photoshop                                 giving the clients JPEGs of that to view                                 so they can sign off on those then move                                 into site development and hopefully                                 eventually launch the site it's pretty                                 Liddy or linear pretty waterfall and                                 responsive design as we found out                                 changes a lot of that most importantly                                 we found it's not just an option you can                                 tack on at any point of the project it's                                 not just a checkbox that you have the                                 client check on you know a work                                 agreement because it does affect this                                 entire process it's not just one thing                                 you can add on and hope it works out                                 okay using the same process that you've                                 always gone through so where does this                                 all start well it really starts with the                                 client your initial meeting with them                                 relay the expectations relay the                                 deliverables you'll be giving them and                                 we'll obviously go through those in the                                 talk today but it's very important that                                 you communicate with your client no                                 matter what their knowledge base is in                                 terms of design or responsive itself we                                 work with a lot of publishing clients                                 and because of the success of the Boston                                 Globe and the great work done there by                                 multiple teams other publishing clients                                 have taken notice that and they come to                                 us asking for responsive design but                                 they're not always aware of everything                                 that goes into it they think responsive                                 is just about three break points                                 sometimes you just need a little more                                 CSS and then everything else everything                                 else is going to work out okay that's                                 not actually the case if you've ever                                 done any type of response of work you                                 know that responsive can affect                                 timelines deliverables                                 and if you're going to be working in                                 this new way it's important to                                 communicate to the client upfront what                                 these are especially if they've already                                 been through a traditional process so                                 they know what's different what's                                 changing what they can expect so they're                                 not surprised by a prototype that they                                 get and they were expecting you know a                                 full-fledged design comp at a certain                                 stage so relate these things do your                                 clients upfront hugely important then                                 knowledge sharing within your team a                                 mind meld of sorts it's very important                                 to educate internally as well if you                                 keep your responsive design knowledge                                 enclosed in your design team or your                                 front-end team and no one else in the                                 company knows what's going on you're                                 going to come into some angst when                                 someone sells a client projects and then                                 you get into the middle of it and then                                 you figure out there's not enough time                                 to do what's necessary to produce an                                 effective responsive site or when you                                 get into development the developers are                                 suddenly surprised by what need what the                                 site needs to do what it needs to                                 respond to so educate your team                                 internally make sure everyone is on                                 board make sure they're at the kickoff                                 to so that each department can offer                                 feedback and suggestions when it comes                                 to considering the constraints that come                                 with responsive design you can do this a                                 few ways we do at phase two we do lunch                                 and learns every week where we all grab                                 lunch and we have someone internally                                 just talk about what they're learning or                                 something new they discovered on the web                                 that week or share something about a                                 client project that was difficult a                                 great way to knowledge share also a                                 training budget for your employees to                                 send them to conferences like this or                                 just a smaller workshops that are more                                 specifically geared responsive and give                                 opportunities for each of your employees                                 to go and discover this methodology of                                 design so that they know how to prepare                                 for it in their piece of the project                                 the biggest way the process has changed                                 i think is a shift in understanding of                                 how the typical project process works                                 and it's not a relay race it's not where                                 one department focuses on their                                 deliverable they get it ready to go to                                 the client the client approves it then                                 they hand it off you know if I was a                                 designer I would get the design comps                                 approved hand off to the developers and                                 then I wouldn't have to worry about the                                 project the rest of the time until it                                 launched not a really good way to work                                 in any project process but especially in                                 responsive design it's crucial and                                 you'll find that you'll do a lot of                                 cross-pollination between disciplines                                 and we'll get into a few examples of                                 that one way to start this off the bat                                 again as I have everyone at the kickoff                                 to offer their perspectives you can hold                                 page review sessions in the project once                                 you get to designing pages or flows have                                 the whole team gather around these and                                 give their feedback based on their                                 expertise and then not just a one-off on                                 a deliverable it's very iterative I find                                 in responsive where you're designing                                 then you're critiquing then you're kind                                 of rinsing and repeat over and over                                 until you arrive at something final                                 that's workable and usable across the                                 different breakpoints and that's really                                 going to be useful for your client so                                 let's jump into the process we start                                 with content content is king as the                                 familiar phrase goes and that's really                                 what drives our designs if you're not                                 designing around your content your                                 client is just as well off going to buy                                 a template for a hundred dollars off a                                 theme shop and then putting all their                                 content to their                                 content helps frame our design decisions                                 it helps us produce better design                                 decisions and that's really the message                                 that we're trying to get across it's not                                 trying to make the web page look fancy                                 which I think most of us designers                                 understand it's about getting that                                 message across in a way that can reach                                 the users those people behind the screen                                 so in content this is kind of where we                                 start to see a cross-pollination when                                 you're designing responsive it's not I                                 don't think it's really feasible to ask                                 for all your content up front which I've                                 been guilty of doing in the past myself                                 as a designer kind of demanding that you                                 know the client or the content                                 strategist on your team they kind of                                 gather every piece of content lock it in                                 so that we know exactly what we're                                 designing for and then once that happens                                 we can finally move on into the project                                 and start designing stuff mark Bolton                                 wrote a great article a few months ago                                 and kind of the battle between this and                                 its really a content and design together                                 in the process and not one before the                                 other and so as your content person your                                 publisher or your content strategist                                 within your team or working with the                                 client we found it useful to work with                                 your UX person whoever is doing the                                 wireframes so that they can kind of work                                 together established hierarchy kind of                                 rough out even on just sketching how the                                 page is going to work across different                                 break points so even right now at a very                                 low fidelity point in the project you're                                 working through how things can respond                                 even though you're not really presenting                                 that to the client yet you're just                                 setting yourself up for being most                                 efficient throughout the process things                                 like how the content will affect the                                 grid that you choose and how it affects                                 different break points where your                                 content breaks at a certain resolution                                 and then forming your break point from                                 that                                 so the most bare-bones part of content                                 is the written word right our copy so                                 how do we craft our words responsively                                 flow is a very key concept here and I                                 think this is a great point to start                                 with mobile first I'm not really going                                 to get into the details as lucrative a                                 great keynote this morning but even                                 starting mobile first on your content it                                 helps you focus on the essentials                                 so starting with the smallest screen                                 even when you're writing and thinking of                                 those constraints that you have with                                 smaller screen sizes and then building                                 up from there it's not just beneficial                                 for us as a project team to be                                 constrained by those but it obviously                                 also benefits the client as it prepares                                 them for growth we've seen the statists                                 the statistics on how fast mobile is                                 growing how its continuing to grow I                                 mean who knows what kind of devices                                 there will be two or five years from now                                 and so if you're focusing on this                                 experience first for this highly for                                 this rapidly growing market that's only                                 going to serve that awesome experience                                 to more people down the road as more and                                 more continue to buy devices like                                 smartphones and tablets so starting                                 small kind of prepares you for that                                 growth and it benefits the client in                                 that way as well and you can even use                                 that as a selling point with them when                                 starting mobile first or using                                 responsive in general a few practical                                 ways keep flow in mind when you're                                 writing your content don't assume an                                 input method or a page structure when                                 you're writing your content this is an                                 example from the Minneapolis st. Paul                                 Business Journal just an article I was                                 reading one day if you can't see                                 highlighting they say click to the right                                 to view this gallery well you can                                 imagine on a smaller device as that                                 shrinks that gallery may not be to the                                 right anymore it may be underneath or                                 further down the page or maybe these                                 instructions won't even be there who                                 knows so keeping in mind content                                 placement but also input method avoid                                 using terms like click if you don't know                                 what device are going to be using they                                 may be using their finger and using the                                 input of touch for instance so things                                 like you know check out links in the                                 sidebar for more information which is                                 which is pretty common when you strength                                 to a different breakpoint those links                                 are going to shift under and use your                                 user is going to be wondering where'd                                 that content you I don't even see a                                 sidebar you say these are important                                 links but I can't really find them                                 and I kind of leads into a different                                 point use caution when hiding content                                 from users especially on smaller screen                                 devices I think this is a trap a lot of                                 people fell into when responsive design                                 first started getting going and they                                 wanted to build their own site they                                 would especially even when starting from                                 a desktop an existing desktop site and                                 just creating smaller media query style                                 sheets for mobile devices they would                                 just hide a bunch of content so                                 everything would kind of flow nicely                                 when you got onto the phone experience                                 the tablet experience but a lot of times                                 that content of stuff users actually                                 want to use I think it's very dangerous                                 to assume context on these devices as                                 well Luke shared a couple of great                                 examples this morning again how people                                 are using phones not just on the go                                 they're using a lot of people are using                                 them in their homes while they're                                 watching TV or even while they have long                                 periods of time to do things if they're                                 out and about like sitting in line at                                 the DMV for instance they have time to                                 accomplish these tasks that we present                                 and allow in our full desktop site but a                                 lot of times people hide these and                                 minimalize these and I think that's very                                 dangerous to do because you'll just                                 leave your users end up being frustrated                                 it can also confuse them if they're                                 coming into your site from a google                                 search because if Google is indexing all                                 this content you have on your desktop                                 experience or your high res experience                                 so to say and then they come to it on a                                 mobile device in that content is hidden                                 they're going to be really confused                                 again about well google says this                                 content is on this page but I can't find                                 it anywhere what's going on and hiding                                 content doesn't remove page load I mean                                 it's it's all getting loaded in anyway                                 so it's not like you're saving your user                                 speed or anything like that one example                                 I came across just in the past few weeks                                 is ESPN com it's March Madness i created                                 a bracket and this is an example of                                 punishing your users because they're on                                 their viewing your site on the                                 quote-unquote wrong device we already                                 talked about how users want this full                                 experience even on small devices and so                                 when I go to                                 on a desktop site or even on my iPad and                                 use the desktop version and presented                                 with this typical bracket layout that                                 I'm accustomed to as someone who likes                                 sports and enjoys March Madness I can                                 kind of see the tournament and what team                                 is we can who and before it started I                                 could click on teams or touch on teams                                 and advance them to the next round but                                 by default when I'm on the iPad ESPN                                 sends me to this page where it's totally                                 different there's a super confusing                                 navigation to get to different regions                                 of the bracket they have that drop down                                 but I don't know what team is in the                                 east or what teams in the Midwest this                                 list isn't really how a tournament or                                 bracket is usually set up so it's a much                                 different experience trying to scan and                                 read the content that I want to access                                 but if I'm on the tablet and I use the                                 desktop version link that they provide I                                 can get back to this normal view but why                                 even separate that in the first place so                                 just make sure you're taking those                                 considerations into account when                                 crafting content now there may be times                                 when you do need to hide content for                                 whatever reason maybe really complex or                                 long tasks that users might perform that                                 because you know your users they're                                 probably not going to want to accomplish                                 those when they're on a go when they                                 don't have as much resolution to view                                 things may be things like filling out a                                 significantly long form something like                                 an application where they have to input                                 a ton of data and copy and paste from                                 different different places something                                 that can be cumbersome on a smaller                                 device so there are instances where                                 that's possible I would just advise you                                 to be really careful this is an example                                 a quick demo that a guy named Frankie                                 Roberto did basically he's just adding a                                 custom class two sections that he wants                                 to hide I think he called the class                                 additional info and he's just hiding                                 that on smaller break points to remove                                 content and you could use this obviously                                 on a much larger scale but just take                                 caution when doing that and make sure                                 you're doing it because it serves our                                 users and not just for an aesthetic                                 purpose or just to save flow space                                 what about other types of content                                 there's media like images which really                                 is a work in progress right now there's                                 not really a perfect solution and you'll                                 really find this in a lot of areas when                                 designing responsively it's such a new                                 technology there's always new methods                                 and techniques coming out it's really                                 important to stay on top of these things                                 but also keep in mind a lot of this                                 isn't to the ideal point that we wish it                                 were especially when it comes to things                                 like standards and accessibility so                                 depending on your project make sure                                 you're aware of what these techniques                                 are and how you can use them obviously                                 with images we want to serve up                                 mobile-friendly images to those with low                                 bandwidth but this is also hard there's                                 JavaScript there's JavaScript out there                                 to do this in some ways but since that's                                 been developed for instance i think the                                 Boston Globe wrote their own JavaScript                                 method but since they did that browsers                                 are now doing what's called image                                 prefetching and they're allowing images                                 to be fetched before the entire pages                                 parsed so that javascript is kind of                                 broken in those browsers and so even                                 that solution that was very well thought                                 out at the time you can see as the                                 internet changes as technology changes                                 things are prone to break as in all                                 areas of Technology actually so this is                                 a good stopgap I think it's developed by                                 Josh Emerson it's called responsive                                 enhance and it basically takes the                                 Instagram approach of giving your users                                 the illusion of speed even if you're not                                 actually making things faster at all                                 what it does is it serves up multiple                                 resolution multiple images of multiple                                 resolutions to the user but at low it                                 loads the smallest one first and                                 displays that on the page and it won't                                 load the next one it won't show the next                                 image until it's completely finished                                 loading so users aren't getting that pop                                 in effect or that jerkiness that comes                                 to site loading if they're on a super                                 slow connection they're still seeing the                                 image in the page but as it continues to                                 download as they have more bandwidth and                                 depending on screen size they're served                                 up and you either even higher quality of                                 an image so again not a perfect solution                                 but I think a good stopgap as it gives                                 the appearance to speed of the user and                                 I think that's something that's                                 important at this point for video                                 obviously you want to serve up your                                 video in mobile friendly formats not                                 just serve up one that's only going to                                 work on web browsers or one that will                                 only work on mobile obviously there's a                                 great JavaScript called fit fit foods                                 jjs I think the guys at paravel produced                                 it's very lightweight so there's not a                                 lot of page load to add it's really easy                                 to use and it works with embedding video                                 from sites like YouTube and Vimeo so                                 very useful for videos                                 advertising is something we've come up                                 against again is having a lot of                                 publishing clients when you're using                                 responsive and even working with                                 different breakpoints the problem with                                 ads is that they usually come in at a                                 fixed width and if your column sizes are                                 constantly changing your content is                                 shifting around if you're popping in                                 these fixed with images you can imagine                                 how that's going to break a page that I                                 would make things look kind of                                 dysfunctional so it's again this is                                 something you'd probably want to touch                                 on very early on with your client and                                 see if they want to serve up ads if they                                 have existing ad server or if they're                                 just starting try to work with them on                                 how they want things to work there's not                                 really a perfect solution for this yet                                 either so there's going to be is going                                 to have to be some compromise do your                                 clients mind if their ads show up on                                 mobile is a good question to ask we                                 recently worked on the site I'm still                                 working on a site with associated press                                 and I think they just decided since it                                 was going to break things and they felt                                 responsive as important heading forward                                 they were just hide ads on lower                                 breakpoints to keep things consistent                                 for the user there are some ad                                 publishers and ad servers like buy sell                                 ads who say that they're working on                                 techniques or trying to accommodate                                 these things but again it's to work in                                 progress and there's really no perfect                                 solution so again work with your client                                 every project is different obviously                                 some techniques aren't going to work for                                 everybody so make sure you're talking                                 with them and figure out what what their                                 needs are concerning advertising and how                                 you both can move forward in the project                                 taking that into account                                 okay so wireframing how does responsive                                 design affect our wire frames are our                                 deliverables the same what do we show                                 clients do we wireframe each break point                                 all these are questions we had going in                                 and I'm sure you have some as well                                 obviously again I would recommend                                 starting small with mobile first and if                                 you've already started writing your                                 content that way you've already started                                 working with you your UX person that way                                 you probably already have a good set of                                 page structures at this point so you can                                 transition into wireframes pretty easily                                 I think wire frames are the best stage                                 in the process to kind of statically                                 comp up every page in a very bare-bones                                 sense wireframes are great for that and                                 that's one of the original purposes that                                 we use them for because this is a very                                 low fidelity point in the project and                                 will see this across different areas and                                 I think that's a battle you'll come                                 across too is this battle between                                 fidelity and finality right your clients                                 want to see finality they want to see                                 the project and the process progressing                                 visibly so that they know they're                                 getting closer to getting a full site                                 that they can hopefully be proud of in                                 love at the same point we're battling                                 fidelity so we want to keep things                                 pretty loose early on and especially                                 when we're dealing with responsive                                 design if a change request comes in when                                 you're further down the line in the                                 process like if you did the design com                                 for every page in every break point or                                 you're into development and these big                                 change requests come in those change                                 requests are going to take a lot longer                                 and a lot more manpower to execute then                                 if you kind of head that off early on in                                 this wireframe stage so I'd recommend                                 and it's worked for us to wireframe out                                 every page and breakpoint this step but                                 also complement those with prototypes                                 again this is where collaboration comes                                 in kind of between your UX and your                                 front-end development developer right                                 now to kind of test out your breakpoints                                 this is the benefit to prototyping                                 prototyping brings                                 it allows you to test your breakpoints                                 how your content is flowing even at this                                 early stage and it also lets your client                                 kind of see that if we're just showing                                 them a bunch of static images at this                                 point that's not really giving them an                                 accurate picture of what they're going                                 to get at the end of the project their                                 site is going to be a fluid living thing                                 flowing between all these different                                 devices and bright points and I think as                                 soon as we can give them kind of an idea                                 of what that's going to look like I                                 think it's beneficial for them as well                                 and also for us as we try to design the                                 best experience for them again this                                 helps us attack content flow problems                                 here and also client feedback problems                                 here at a low fedeli a low fidelity                                 stage in the project so what could this                                 look like people at head scape have                                 actually put together this little demo                                 that I could see being very useful on                                 different projects it's basically just a                                 demo page where you cycle through the                                 different breakpoints and you could even                                 show this to your client they can click                                 through the different breakpoints you                                 have available and at a very low                                 fidelity but informative stage of the                                 project they can see how their content                                 is going to flow between all these                                 devices and so working with your                                 front-end developer can be a great asset                                 the stage in the process whereas it                                 would typically wait until after designs                                 were done to get involved in the project                                 what about design my favorite part of                                 the project little bias of it at this                                 point it's really not financially                                 feasible we've found to create comps and                                 breakpoints in Photoshop for every page                                 it's just I mean if your client has an                                 endless amount of cash to spend maybe                                 but I really don't think it's beneficial                                 to the project no matter what your                                 budget sizes again now we're getting                                 into the the more high fidelity stage of                                 the prop the process where change                                 requests are going to take more time                                 you've seen this even when comping up                                 individual pages clients try to come and                                 take things from this example or that                                 and they want you to kind of change your                                 comp into these different things and it                                 takes time and obviously you build in                                 time for this change requests but when                                 you're dealing with all these different                                 pages and break points it just becomes                                 very unwieldy so how do we approach                                 design then and responsive process                                 Oliver has a great quote the tool                                 doesn't make the craftsman I think as                                 designers responsive design gives us a                                 great opportunity to step back and kind                                 of evaluate the available tool set that                                 we have for us                                 I know my process has changed a little                                 when moving into responsive projects and                                 you may find yourself low then you have                                 you probably will so what is that                                 workflow look like for us well we start                                 with style tiles where Samantha my                                 coworker is kind of championed she's                                 also put together the site about it                                 style tile is a great companion site but                                 style tiles are kind of a low fidelity                                 intro for the client into the design                                 process they're kind of quick and dirty                                 change requests don't take nearly as                                 long because it's just a snapshot to set                                 kind of the visual tone for the site                                 that will go and apply to the rest of                                 the pages and the rest of the                                 breakpoints it also benefits the client                                 because it gives them an early                                 opportunity in the design phase to get                                 feedback in on the visual part of the                                 design and I know as designers we kind                                 of shut her away from client design                                 feedback because you know we're the ones                                 that went to art school right what what                                 reason they have to comment on colors or                                 placement or anything like that a client                                 feedback can be very important I                                 wouldn't ignore it and this is a great                                 place to get started especially visually                                 this helps us avoid when we get into the                                 comp stage that we're kind of used to of                                 clients making those change of quests                                 that again take more time or they're                                 kind of Frank and comping if you will                                 which is afraid amantha likes to use                                 where clients will take examples from                                 one thing and another and ask you to                                 kind of combine that all after you've                                 already kind of established the content                                 and the wireframe for the site and those                                 that kind of feedback changes everything                                 which isn't really useful and it just                                 makes the project drag on it makes                                 timeline slip and make things very                                 frustrating for everyone so style tiles                                 really help combat that and it also                                 avoids kind of the do-or-die                                 presentation that we designers have                                 sometimes gotten ourselves into where we                                 start the design process we go off into                                 our little hole do all these comps come                                 back show the client and just hope they                                 like it and if they don't                                 and the feedback is significant you know                                 what are you going to do sometimes they                                 ask you to start all over and that's not                                 good for anybody so this helps avoid                                 that as well so style tiles es style ti                                 él es is a great companion site if you                                 want to check that out explains things                                 much more in-depth you can download a                                 template example to get started yourself                                 a really useful tool in our design                                 process moving on from there kind of                                 getting to the traditional Palm stage                                 and there's kind of been this debate or                                 battle recently in the design world                                 about designing in the browser or                                 designing in a static program like                                 Photoshop or fireworks or InDesign like                                 the Boston Globe team used which I found                                 pretty interesting basically arguments                                 are you know again the site that your                                 client is going to get isn't a static                                 page so we should design in the browser                                 and give them the most accurate                                 representation we can however this                                 doesn't really work depending on the                                 project team I think it's really a both                                 in the responsive process it really                                 depends on your skill set if your                                 designer knows a lot of front-end                                 development if they know HTML and CSS                                 very well javascript etc and they can                                 jump into the browser I would recommend                                 doing that as fast as possible because                                 again it gives the client a fast                                 representation of what they're going to                                 get into the in the end but there's also                                 awesome designers who aren't really that                                 skilled in front of development maybe                                 you came from a traditional print                                 background of design and you're just                                 kind of getting your feet wet in web                                 design it's probably not most                                 cost-effective for you to get into a                                 project and then kind of work your way                                 through all this having to take a bunch                                 of training courses in the middle of a                                 project to figure out how to design in                                 the browser so it really depends on your                                 skill set so just evaluate these tools                                 for yourself as a designer figure out                                 what works for you experiment a little                                 try to have fun personally I've found                                 myself jumping back and forth between                                 sketching Photoshop and the browser                                 myself because different programs or                                 different ways of designing her                                 for different things the programs like                                 Photoshop or fireworks they're better                                 for I find at least they're better for                                 fidelity they're better better for                                 getting in to the details getting things                                 looking exactly how I want them to using                                 the tools available in Photoshop x y                                 sabado be released a beta of photoshop                                 six today that actually makes web design                                 a lot better it seems I'm excited to see                                 what they have there but then the                                 browser is a lot better for flexibility                                 you know if changes come in you can make                                 them a lot easier in CSS and have them                                 apply to all the pages you've set up and                                 all the breakpoints you set up for your                                 clients so jumping back and forth                                 between these tools depending on what                                 works best for you another thing I'd                                 recommend is actually sitting near a                                 front-end developer during this part of                                 the process especially if you're not                                 going to be doing a lot of that front                                 end in building the design comps to show                                 the client that proximity I think is                                 really undervalued you can work with                                 them as a partner again this cross                                 collaboration between different parts of                                 the process or project can be really                                 yeah okay sorry this better I'll lean                                 over like this okay                                 I don't forget the volume turned up so                                 even sitting close to a front-end                                 developer in this part of the process                                 can be helpful working with them so they                                 know what you're designing they know                                 what's coming if they're the ones                                 building the comps in the browser as                                 well and we also supplement I found it                                 really useful to supplement these comps                                 whether it be in the browser or what I                                 found useful is to design just one or                                 two pages in Photoshop and the                                 accompanying break points for them and                                 then also designing a sort of style                                 guide to either give myself reference or                                 the front-end developer whether it's a                                 PSD or whether you want to do it as HTML                                 documents to give the developers later                                 on in the process a reference point                                 because you're not giving them a comp                                 for what every single page on the site                                 is going to look like but you can give                                 them a reference like this they can go                                 back to and say oh a block quote needs                                 to look like this or a call to action                                 box needs to look like this icons need                                 to look like this etc and we found that                                 pretty useful the BBC did this when they                                 redesigned a few years ago theirs is                                 actually really really detailed and they                                 go through things like defining every                                 single element on the site a                                 downloadable style guide you can                                 actually go check this out yourself I'll                                 be including resources links when I post                                 these slides so giving your entire team                                 these types of tools to be most                                 efficient even later on especially in                                 this process where we're not designing                                 each and every page for the client but                                 we're still able to set up these styles                                 and these resources for the team down                                 the road I think it's also important to                                 hold what i would call page review                                 sessions basically just as you design                                 these first few pages especially in the                                 project kind of gather your team and get                                 their feedback if you've already built                                 them in the browser have everybody pull                                 out their device and test them on their                                 own device so they can give feedback as                                 well for how it's displaying to them                                 and kind of meet at set intervals                                 throughout the process so you're not                                 kind of designing this one set of pages                                 then showing the client and getting                                 approval but you're also working with                                 you in your team and iterating there and                                 getting feedback from them as well                                 because they also know the constraints                                 of the project and again some more                                 cross-pollination here they can give                                 valuable feedback they can look at this                                 page and say well if we do this it's not                                 really going to work at the smaller                                 break point because of this constraint                                 or something like this so make sure you                                 involve those before even showing the                                 client and kind of leaving your                                 teammates out to dry when they have to                                 try to piece together and make things                                 work that you've designed as a designer                                 I think we've all kind of made those                                 mistakes especially early on in our                                 career where we haven't considered other                                 people in the process from design we                                 just wanted things to look really sweet                                 and you can even do this with clients to                                 when you're showing them these pages                                 it's also an iterative process as well I                                 would try to set that expectation with                                 the client at the very beginning                                 obviously you want to build in a certain                                 number revisions and runs of feedback                                 but I think as much feedback as you can                                 get as helpful as you're designing                                 across all these different screens and                                 even have the clients I've actually                                 found this to be pretty cool have the                                 clients pull up the site on there                                 whatever mobile phone they have even if                                 it's not something you've specifically                                 designed for or their tablet it's a                                 little scary but they've also found it                                 to be really cool to even if it's a                                 lower end device not a low end but hello                                 not as capable device like a Blackberry                                 or something like that where they don't                                 have a full browser on these on these                                 older mobile phones but if you've set up                                 your design well it can still scale and                                  they kind of have that personal                                  connection with the design because                                  they're seeing it on their actual phone                                  and not just up on a screen when you're                                  presenting it to them or even in a                                  browser they kind of realize and get                                  that wow this is really going to work                                  for multiple devices and for multiple                                  people in this growing area                                  as far as development goes we haven't                                  really seen a huge impact on on the                                  process in terms of a mind shift or a                                  huge change in how our developers work                                  especially on the back end but there are                                  a few things we found really important                                  it's that they're involved as early as                                  possible so again hopefully in that                                  kickoff meeting rounds of feedback etc                                  so they can give that perspective from                                  their area of expertise so again we're                                  not kind of setting them up to piece                                  together what we've designed or what                                  we've decided content wise or in our                                  wire frames they kind of know what's                                  coming and even if your front end person                                  is creating things in the browser if                                  they're theming for instance have them                                  in constant communication with your                                  back-end developer so that they can kind                                  of communicate and your front-end                                  developer can say well I'm going to need                                  this class name when it comes time to                                  integrate into the CMS so they know that                                  when the CMS spits out this the stuff                                  they're not going to have to reconfigure                                  a whole bunch to get things looking                                  right or to get things integrated                                  this is true also if the design is being                                  out sourced on your project as well I                                  realize all of you don't have a full                                  project team maybe you're a freelancer                                  and you work with an agency or your shop                                  & Lido's development and you and your                                  outsourced design it's pretty important                                  to understand this workflow as well our                                  developers have found that especially                                  when it's time to integrate with a CMS                                  like Drupal it's not really beneficial                                  for for our back-end developers to get                                  handed everything built out in front end                                  code in HTML and CSS because when it                                  comes time to integrate with Drupal                                  everything doesn't really match up it's                                  not useful as as our developers prefer                                  to work more from that style guide that                                  i mentioned earlier where they can go                                  and see that resource they can look at                                  the comps know the visual style know                                  what a few pages need to look like build                                  those and then from that style guide                                  kind of build up from there one of my                                  co-workers Josh Cooper wrote a great                                  article on our blog kind of detailing                                  that process called death of a cut-up                                  man or he talks about kind of that                                  frustration of being asked to go from a                                  fully fleshed-out HTML and CSS kind of                                  package of the site migrating that to                                  Drupal where it saved a ton of time if                                  he's just handed the design a style                                  guide and he can work out from there to                                  kind of build things from scratch and                                  then with Drupal there's also tools like                                  Omega which I'm sure some of you are                                  familiar with it's going to get you                                  started in responsive process I think                                  it's a great starting point if you're                                  working with Drupal especially when                                  setting up your grade it allows you to                                  change that according to what your                                  content is so you could get a good start                                  when integrating into Drupal itself                                  so after we kind of designed and built                                  the site there's a lot of testing that                                  needs to happen this is actually where                                  we found there's the largest increase in                                  time spent in a responsive process is on                                  the testing and obviously you can just                                  resize your browser to see how your site                                  is going to respond but I don't think                                  that gives you a super accurate picture                                  of how it's going to really work for the                                  everyday user there's also great web                                  tools like browser stack adobe shadow                                  but these don't always accurately                                  translate either i think they're really                                  useful and I think we should definitely                                  use them but we shouldn't rely on them                                  for concrete testing results Brad Frost                                  wrote a great blog post on why we need                                  to use real mobile devices and how we                                  can do it without breaking the bank                                  especially if you're a smaller agency                                  you're not going to be able to afford                                  and I'll go by forty different devices                                  so you can test your site on he gives                                  some really practical steps on how you                                  can kind of cut costs by buying either                                  second or third gen devices for instance                                  buying an ipod touch instead of an                                  iphone that's tied to a cell plan so you                                  can still test within mobile safari but                                  you're not paying that monthly fee or                                  you're not paying for an unsubsidized                                  phone why should we test on mobile                                  devices well because the display varies                                  depending on the browser you're viewing                                  it in and just like the desktop between                                  iOS blackberry Android and it even                                  varies things like fonts can render                                  totally different even depending on                                  carrier even if it's the same device and                                  same version of the OS so all these                                  things are good to keep in mind it's                                  doable on a budget again i'll be posting                                  the link to Brad's blog post with my                                  slides and it's it's worth investing in                                  these I think because this market is                                  growing and it is expanding and if                                  you're committing yourself to this these                                  are going to be really useful tools for                                  you in the future                                  if you need some help deciding on what                                  devices too by stephanie rigor has a                                  great blog post on strategies for                                  choosing one and she recommends a pretty                                  good set that you can go at that doesn't                                  cost a whole lot i'll be posting that as                                  well also test for bandwidth this is a                                  pretty big deal as well read white                                  readwriteweb with mouthful they did a                                  study and found out that one of four                                  users abandons your page if it loads in                                  more than four seconds and this is kind                                  of a disturbing trend that I think since                                  since two thousand page sizes or page                                  load sizes have increased by like ten                                  times or something like that and so                                  these things are kind of fighting each                                  other because we need to be serving up                                  resource friendly pages but it seems                                  like on the web the trend is to make all                                  these rich graphical pages that are                                  actually taking up more space so make                                  sure you find a good compromise there                                  obviously I I see the benefit of serving                                  up a great visual experience to the user                                  but don't let it cost your client things                                  like conversions or use your attention                                  where they're going to lose people                                  viewing their site if it takes too long                                  to load you can actually test this out                                  even on your PC if you have the benefit                                  of being in a location where you always                                  have great cell service there's programs                                  you can use that i'll post that you can                                  actually use to limit the bandwidth                                  coming into your pc or your mac so you                                  can even test these on your own and                                  obviously there's extensions likewise lo                                  that gives you some recommendations on                                  how to improve speed                                  I keep in mind it's not just for mobile                                  phones people could be on a laptop or a                                  netbook using a                                                          speeds could be limited and phone could                                  be on a super fast connection like Wi-Fi                                  or                                                                       networks and that has faster speeds than                                  i have at home with my isp so they make                                  the mistake that just because it's a                                  small screen they don't have any                                  bandwidth it's still a consideration to                                  take into account however what about one                                  of times when it comes time to hand off                                  the site to a client I think we all know                                  that the site really isn't done once                                  it's launched its continuously living                                  and breathing thing even if we've given                                  total control over to the client I think                                  we still have responsibility to set them                                  up and to prepare them especially in                                  this new area of responsive design so                                  that they're not breaking things I mean                                  I think it's a fear we all have                                  especially I do as a designer I don't                                  want to hand off the site to a client                                  and see them start uploading images at                                  the wrong resolution that are going to                                  break the layout or input all these                                  images into the main slideshow on the                                  home page that are just totally ugly and                                  pixelated or get stretched out of                                  proportion and that's of fear but I                                  think it's our fault if we don't take                                  responsibility and set them up for these                                  things we shouldn't be setting the                                  client up for failure just handing them                                  off and letting them run to the site we                                  need to be preparing them giving them                                  training even the content producers of                                  the site because we have all these                                  different content flows across these                                  break points and if our content editors                                  don't understand how to write these                                  headlines what fields to use in the CMS                                  things are going to break pretty quick                                  so try to build in some time to actually                                  train these people on the client side or                                  your stakeholders so that they're                                  prepared to maintain the site if you                                  aren't the one helping them do so you                                  can do this through documentation and                                  training you can also do this through                                  things like style guides for your client                                  starbucks actually                                  recently redesigned their site to be                                  responsive and they also released this                                  companion style guide that kind of tells                                  it goes through all these different                                  areas of content and kind of tells their                                  content producers how things should work                                  what the grid is what resolution their                                  images need to be how to serve up                                  different resolution sizes for different                                  breakpoints and you can actually go and                                  see this yourself so this is probably                                  for their internal team but it's                                  something that I think is easily                                  reproducible especially once you get a                                  template going you can kind of turn it                                  out on multiple client projects on                                  giving them this leave behind or this                                  documentation so that they're just not                                  left on their own to run their own site                                  and hope just hope that things turn out                                  ok so we've kind of seen instead of a                                  linear process like this I've been                                  mentioning throughout how it's a much                                  more flexible one there's a lot of cross                                  collaboration cross-pollination between                                  disciplines at different points in the                                  project that you wouldn't normally                                  interact with these team members and                                  that's really one of the fun parts for                                  me I get to talk to a lot of team                                  members I don't usually get to at                                  different points in the project and just                                  hearing from their perspective how I can                                  make my design better and I can give                                  feedback on how they can display content                                  better and things like that so it's your                                  disciplines aren't siloed anymore                                  they're not contained I'm not contained                                  as a designer just to my desk on my own                                  i can get feedback from these people and                                  i need to throughout this process and it                                  really helps you work as a real team                                  it's much more organic instead of that                                  linear or relay race process that I                                  talked about the beginning so these are                                  all kind of important considerations                                  across all these areas you can see how                                  responsive isn't just limited to media                                  queries CSS and even just the designer                                  it really affects all these different                                  areas from content all the way to how                                  clients maintain the site afterwards                                  but we're also just at the beginning of                                  this I think as a web community I'm not                                  claiming we have all this figured out                                  I'm sure some of you in this room have                                  better ways of doing things and I just                                  shared responsive design is kind of at                                  the beginning I think even though it's                                  been around for a few years the                                  techniques have at least and so these                                  things are going to keep changing I mean                                  I'm sure this talk will be out of date                                  within six months to a year because                                  there's going to be new techniques new                                  processes and as the standards people                                  get on board hopefully we can start to                                  craft these sites for our clients and                                  for our users that will serve them in                                  the long run that would be future                                  friendly and it will take advantage of                                  this growing market of multiple devices                                  and multiple screens and even bigger                                  screens like you know the rumored Apple                                  TV or I don't even I don't know who                                  wants to surf the web on their TV                                  actually but screens are getting bigger                                  I mean there's rumors of retina displays                                  for desktop computers now obviously the                                  new iPad which was released a few last                                  week I think and so there's all these                                  different considerations that keep                                  changing how we work and that's really                                  why I love this industry these changes                                  are challenging and they allow us to be                                  more creative in our thinking and how we                                  can best serve our users so make sure                                  you just keep these thoughts a priority                                  throughout your process if you have any                                  other thoughts please come talk to me                                  I'd love to learn from you as well and                                  remember responsive isn't just about                                  resizing your browser and having a cool                                  site in the end it's really a help it's                                  really about helping save you time and                                  iterating or redesigning the site a                                  couple years down the road but instead                                  being future friendly and                                  forward-thinking it helps save your                                  client money in that respect and it                                  really gives both parties a site they                                  can be proud of and one that hopefully                                  your users will love so that's my talk                                  thanks very much                                  yeah I will post my slides on later                                  today and there'll be resource slides                                  with links on those as well if anyone                                  has any questions feel free to step up                                  to the mic I think we have a few minutes                                  at least                                  hi yeah                                  question regarding your your style                                  guides in involving that in your process                                  are you building that into your project                                  plan for the clients as in that's an                                  additional feature or how are you able                                  to justify the additional time it takes                                  to produce a style guide and in addition                                  to the site itself how do you handle                                  that normally okay the question was                                  about the style guides and how we allow                                  for additional time in the project how                                  do we estimate that how do we build etc                                  obviously it takes more time to produce                                  that so we've kind of estimated that                                  across the multiple times I've used this                                  and tried to build that in obviously as                                  you do responsive on your projects the                                  first few times depending on your team                                  you don't really know how long things                                  are going to take so it is kind of hard                                  to the beginning to estimate that one                                  thing that might be helpful is just to                                  try to build one on your own for a                                  fictional project or maybe for your                                  personal site and just pretend that                                  you're building it for someone else and                                  see how long it takes you and use that                                  as an estimate or just build in enough                                  of a buffer your first few projects so                                  that you have that time allowed for you                                  that make sense okay I have a question                                  about the prototype and wireframes do                                  you your day to those or your daughter                                  like just gonna do those or you do it                                  together oh sorry Kira speak a little                                  louder but the wireframe and prototypes                                  yes like in the process do you do those                                  like a designer or your developer like                                  Josh gonna do those oh you don't think I                                  have we have ux people that are                                  responsible for wireframes but i                                  understand every team is kind of built                                  differently yeah like in my previous                                  company for instance i did do the                                  wireframes myself so it really depends                                  on the people you have and the resources                                  you have yeah um it just depends on your                                  project team makeup i would say okay                                  thanks yep                                  I i'm jody mesa and i work for examiner                                  com okay I'm the director of user                                  experience over there and I've been                                  there for about four years and two years                                  ago we switched over to Drupal and one                                  of the biggest challenges that we've had                                  from like the creative perspective and                                  you kind of touched on it a little bit                                  is the fact that the theme errs don't                                  really want to build a static HTML and                                  CSS site that we could use as sort of a                                  prototype you know for user testing and                                  things like that right they we usually                                  have to wait for the development to                                  happen and then the femurs go in and                                  then they stylize it so I was wondering                                  if you could just kind of expand on your                                  process and what you found has worked to                                  integrate Drupal while still allowing                                  you to do prototypes in a small time                                  frame sure                                  how it typically works is like instead                                  of calming up every page like a designer                                  typically one in Photoshop and showing                                  those those would be kind of instead of                                  comping those pages I would build one or                                  one or two out in HTML and CSS not like                                  not the whole site in HTML and CSS I                                  don't know if I was clear on that sorry                                  if not so does your creative team do                                  that like before that goes to the                                  seamers or yes okay yeah I mean art of                                  our developers are kind of it kind of                                  doesn't happen in that water for like                                  our developers are kind of building the                                  backend you know during the project but                                  depending on your makeup again like work                                  with your front-end developer and kind                                  of build those as you I mean you're                                  going to want to show the client these                                  things before you start theming again                                  it's that battle between fidelity and                                  finality again because you don't want to                                  build all this stuff have the client                                  reject it and then you have tons of                                  change requests change request to make                                  they take up a ton of time yeah it seems                                  like it would help with testing as well                                  because the problem is we have to comp                                  out every single page so that the QA                                  team can validate whether it looks right                                  or no right now okay thank you yep thank                                  you                                  you're welcome                                  i think i'm supposed to put this slide                                  you want to go make comments on the                                  presentation i greatly
