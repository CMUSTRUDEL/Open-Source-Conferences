Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: TAPPING INTO THE POWER OF USER NARRATIVES
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	Although user interfaces can be aided by various visual and structural elements, they are fundamentally driven by words, forming what can be called user narratives. But what restrictions prevent Drupal UX designers from achieving clear and well-targeted user narratives? Drupal does a great job of presenting words in various languages, but truly well-defined user narratives must speak at the level of Idioms -- the subtle nuances of speech and terminology that characterizes distinct groups of users - and functional User Roles. Drupal is virtually incapable of achieving this UX goal. Using a real world example as a reference point, this talk will illustrate how to dramatically boost the effectiveness of user interfaces by harnessing the power of user narratives. Along the way, we'll look at how the user narrative model is based on natural 'field-resolution' patterns such as those found within the neurological system. Transcending Drupal's current limits, we'll explore ways that idiomatic, Role-oriented interfaces have been applied in our case study through the use of our 'User Narratives' module. Through this example, we'll catch a glimpse of the powerful dimension of Role-oriented UX design and the benefits it could potentially bring to all aspects of Drupal's UX.

Questions answered by this session: 
Why is precisely targeted wording important for building effective user interfaces?
Why is it important to give authorship of user narratives to UX designers?
Why does the current method for creation and management of user interface text systematically tend towards usability obstacles?
What alternatives exist for effective design and management of user narratives?
What issues arise from alternative methods?

for                               choosing to spend your last hour of                               session with me what I'm going to do is                               I'm going to first of all explain it a                               little bit about Who I am and also I'm                               just going to go over what i want to do                               in the presentation just so that you can                                be sure that this is the one you want to                                be in so who am i I'm I'm a user                                interface systems architect with my                                planet digital based in Toronto they're                                a wonderful design and technology                                company that are very very committed to                                excellence in user experience and that's                                why I'm there because it's a very very                                Hospital at atmosphere for being                                productive along those lines and that's                                my passion so thank you my planet for                                being there what does it mean to be a                                user interface systems architect well                                what it means is I've got two heads the                                first head has big ears because it likes                                to listen to users and what I mean by                                that is I like to put myself into an                                empathy a deep empathy with users to                                find out as much as possible about what                                they're doing as they use applications                                so that I can help them you know have                                more better experiences doing that the                                other head propellerhead is a software                                developer so I actually spent a couple                                of well over two decades doing software                                development and pretty much I think two                                decades doing usability design and                                whatever the current phrases to describe                                that kind of work user be user interface                                or user experience so so the idea is                                that there's two kinds of consciousness                                that I like to try and fuse try to bring                                together I like to bridge the gap                                between those two perspectives so you'll                                see some of that in this presentation                                what I want to do in this presentation                                is open two doors behind the first door                                there's a warm and sunny place where                                users are happy and they're happy                                because they can comprehend their user                                interfaces behind the other door is                                where developers build component                                through user interfaces now if we can                                open both those doors I would like to                                think that we could have new                                conversations about how to bring the                                values of perspectives the needs and so                                on from the door there the sunny place                                into this room so that developers can                                actually build the components in a way                                that is actually easy that does help                                users comprehend those interfaces that's                                the goal that's the goal of this                                presentation to do that I want to                                present you with two keys the first key                                is the concept of user narratives and                                that will touch on one of my big                                passions roll and roll oriented UX                                design I'll be touching on what that is                                also the idea of idioms which is really                                a way of looking at language beyond                                language as English French native                                language that kind of thing and then                                also talking about the what is the what                                do I mean by narratives in terms of real                                life and what do I mean by narratives in                                terms of user interface design it                                involves roles and idioms we get a drink                                so the second                                the second key is some critical                                technical information that helps explain                                things that would be useful if you care                                about how words get on the screen I want                                to show you how that happens from a                                technical point of view won't be                                complicated won't be deep it won't be                                difficult I guarantee you'll be able to                                understand it i also want to talk about                                how from a user experience design point                                of view it's really important to                                organize the words that get on the                                screen because that's part of the                                dimension of user experience design i                                also need to touch on this the fact that                                drupal currently excludes that dimension                                of user experience design from from                                those designers from that will get into                                it and then finally i want to touch on                                an alternative approach which is                                actually inclusive of that perspective                                 from the user experience design                                 perspective so that's what I'm going to                                 be doing if you want these two keys                                 please stay if you don't then there's                                 still time to go and catch something                                 else so you're welcome to to make that                                 adjustment so                                 first I want to talk about three                                 fundamental concepts from the user                                 experience point of view these are sort                                 of three tricks of the trade that that I                                 use routinely the first is a good                                 definition of usability from my point of                                 view usability simply the lack of                                 suffering on the part of the user that's                                 why I like this image the image of                                 barbed wire dancing shoes because of                                 course if you were to use them it would                                 hurt you would be suffering it's a good                                 visual metaphor for the scenario that                                 we're trying to avoid in terms of UX                                 design the next thing is the concept of                                 usage context I use this symbol this is                                 kind of my mascot because it defines for                                 me the meaning of functionality                                 functionality has no meaning outside of                                 the usage context this the function of                                 the traffic cone is absolutely                                 meaningless outside of its usage context                                 it simply is there to point to all the                                 things around it so to me it's a very                                 handy symbol and you'll see that coming                                 up through the presentation we're                                 wanting to draw your attention to usage                                 context in the last thing the main                                 weapon is these two questions if you                                 want to do user experience analysis                                 these are very very useful questions who                                 is the user what are their tasks they're                                 very simple questions but they're if                                 you've done you as user experience                                 design you'll know they're often very                                 difficult to answer but they're very                                 important so through the presentation I                                 want to make reference to a project that                                 we're doing at my planet is still                                 underway we're still in the process of                                 doing it and it's basically a                                 registration system for music exams in                                 two countries that's Canada and the US                                 and canada it's with the Royal                                 Conservatory of Music and the same                                 system exams are being used by Carnegie                                 Hall yeah for the retrieval program in                                 the US we've built two websites at my                                 planet separate websites is two contexts                                 of usage                                 now the main thing is they both share                                 this the the business of selling exams                                 is a core part of their business so the                                 registration for exams has to be very                                 easy because if it's not people will                                 drop out with the process and they will                                 lose money or they will call customer                                 support and it will be a drain on the                                 resources so there's an economic factor                                 in both those things so it's very                                 important that we get that process right                                 and the other thing which is very                                 important here is that there's different                                 user types and that's going to come up a                                 lot through this presentation so the                                 u.s. situation is actually it's a                                 smaller population of students and                                 that's where we've begun the process of                                 in terms of building the pilot project                                 and this is what we've built and before                                 we got there we actually prototyped it                                 we had a very richly interactive                                 prototype that we use to sort of proof                                 the concept of the main function of the                                 registration interaction system and from                                 that we built this site I'll just give                                 you a quick video tour of what that                                 looks like from this point of view so                                 people come in there they get into the                                 registration through that gateway they                                 declare who they are are they a student                                 registering for themselves are they                                 apparent registering for their children                                 or are they a teacher registering on                                 behalf of their students now these are                                 checkboxes they could could                                 theoretically be all of those things as                                 they press those checkboxes the user                                 interface itself is extended to provide                                 new tabs and under those tabs are the                                 interfaces that they use to begin the                                 registration process from that                                 perspective from that individual                                 respective now they all funnel back into                                 this common wizard that takes you                                 through those steps of basically                                 identifying who you are picking the exam                                 that you want to take choosing a time                                 and date that you would like to take it                                 on and then heading off to the checkout                                 page to to pay for it that's it that's                                 what we were trying to do and that's                                 what we want to be really really simple                                 so we did user testing on this and we                                 learned a couple of things well a few                                 things but in two categories some with                                 structural some was just about ours the                                 the the arrangement of the elements and                                 the interaction methods that we use we                                 learn things about you know how to                                 improve that there also were a lot of                                 things about the the language that was                                 used in the interface as well that sort                                 of gets people through it and that's why                                 I want to focus on and here I want to                                 play a couple of clips which are                                 basically a very very articulate                                 feedback from one of the testers he's I                                 didn't pay him but he did actually say                                 precisely what we needed to hear in                                 terms of the feedback around these                                 issues so it's really really excellent                                 sound clips i want here so hopefully                                 this will work this is the the foot so i                                 got to these you won't be able to see it                                 i didn't make it big enough for you see                                 because it's not about seeing about                                 listening I still don't know what I                                 found in school it's all be wood plank I                                 don't know what that means so I don't                                 know if that's the teeth the school I                                 teach at as the teacher or if that's the                                 school that the student goes to yeah                                 well because I don't know what an                                 assessment is in a way I mean I'm                                 assuming it's like I so I can work it                                 out but I wouldn't have liked schedule                                 an exam I mean here were trying to book                                 an exam and really everything is is                                 bordered around assessment I would not                                 think exam for an assessment but if                                 there was a log as to what all of these                                 things men and maybe a glossary of terms                                 excreted find out would founding school                                 men                                 if you have a user asking for a glossary                                 of terms you know you have a problem so                                 that's what we're trying to solve right                                 so terminology was one of the big issues                                 and then there's another one can you                                 summarize again like what your overall                                 impression is I think the language needs                                 to change for each type of person I                                 would if I'm a teacher I would want to                                 see the words that say register my                                 student yeah the language since i'm a                                 teacher and I had to language was                                 written forced for the student yeah and                                 not for the teacher yeah because I'm not                                 because I'm trying to do something as a                                 teacher and all of the words are guiding                                 students rather than teachers so I don't                                 know if it makes sense to have three                                 different types of language that click                                 up when you see student parent teacher                                 because there are three different                                 positions in the information stream so                                 here he's picking up on the fact that                                 there are different types of users and                                 that he was being spoken to from the                                 wrong angle he was being spoken to as a                                 student and he's not a student and                                 didn't make sense to and he's very                                 frustrated by that so those are the two                                 major issues that we're trying to                                 address so really it's about the                                 language but it's about the language                                 from the point of view of going beyond                                 the native language is not English it's                                 not French it's not German etc it's                                 about idioms and whatever is involved in                                 association with speaking to someone is                                 playing a particular role so I want to                                 go into those two areas just to clarify                                 some more details about that so in terms                                 of idioms let's just take a quick look                                 at that we want we want this to be                                 comfortable if we have unfamiliar                                 unfamiliar terms in the interface it's                                 not comfortable we've got Barbara shoes                                 if we have generic terms which is often                                 a solution in few X design because you                                 want to make it fit for everybody but I                                 would say that's equally uncomfortable                                 because it's not speaking in a resonant                                 kind of way if we have familiar terms                                 then it's comfortable at which point                                 we've achieved our Nirvana as UX                                 designers the entire interface becomes                                 invisible no one notices that's the best                                 we can hope for other than that it's                                 pain we want no pain you want people                                 just go dancing so roles life is the                                 sequence of roles roles happen all the                                 time those are about what your mind is                                 focused on at a given time and that's                                 constantly shifting so a given day might                                 be something like this I cooking                                 breakfast I walk the dog not commuting                                 to work I'm emailing I'm not really                                 music student but I could be a music                                 student and if I am I might at some                                 point want to take an exam so I become                                 an exam candidate I want to register for                                 them so in order to fulfill roles like                                 this we also need tools so the kind of                                 tools we need to cook breakfast we might                                 need a stove and a toaster to walk the                                 dog we might need a leash and a dog to                                 be a community we need something like a                                 subway train so all of these things are                                 outside of things that we need to carry                                 out those roles so the objective and the                                 capability of role oriented design is to                                 supply the right tools at the right time                                 if for example you decide to cook                                 breakfast while walking your dog on the                                 subway you know you probably have a                                 confusing time probably the problem so                                 the point is you wouldn't do that but                                 why in terms of user interface would we                                 throw up all of the tools that someone                                 could possibly use in one space and                                 expecting to get through it the whole                                 point roll oriented design is that you                                 wouldn't do that just the right tools                                 nothing missing and nothing in excess                                 that's the objective the other thing                                 about role oriented design this is my                                 other brain speaking is it actually                                 provides a very good pathway between                                 those two doors from that sunny spots                                 where the users should be to the back                                 room where the developers are role                                 oriented design provides a pathway that                                 informs it shines light from one space                                 into the other let's just follow it                                 through quickly so here's all our users                                 on the outside Mary is a music teacher                                 she does exam registration for his                                 students she's a music examiner as well                                 and she's been doing that for so long                                 that she's now an exam center                                 representative those are all various                                 roles that she could play the one I want                                 to look at his exam registration and                                 that consists of a set of tasks she                                 wants to manage her student lists so she                                 can decide who she's dealing with in                                 this session she picks out a student                                 from there she then assigns the exam                                 selection that students should be taking                                 makes the booking and pays on their                                 behalf and presumably she'll build them                                 afterwards and in order to do that this                                 she has the tools on the screen to get                                 through all those tasks now I like to                                 call these things screen where all these                                 things appear on the screen is like                                 software it's like hardware it's screen                                 web and it's something to consider in                                 terms of tools a tool sets which things                                 do you need in which things don't you                                 need so the nice thing about that too                                 then is that once you're looking at                                 screen way from the point of view of the                                 tools there's a relationship between                                 those elements on the screen and the                                 information architecture which is behind                                 the screen which the user doesn't really                                 see in an explicit way except through                                 these kinds of representations and from                                 the I a point of view when it doesn't                                 take very long to get into the actual                                 data itself that's where all lives                                 of course you'd go through something                                 like a viewscreen or some kind of means                                 of extracting that data from the                                 database so roll oriented design has a                                 impact on all these layers what it looks                                 like on the screen the layout and so on                                 the information architecture how that's                                 shaped the data retrieval methods kind                                 of views you might construct and even                                 perhaps the data structures themselves                                 so we want light from the users                                 perspective of the users world to shine                                 all the way through these layers so that                                 it can actually be shaped properly in                                 such a way that makes it comfortable                                 incomprehensible for the for those users                                 so let's get into the narratives connect                                 a few dots to define what that means so                                 user narrative basically I said it                                 involves idioms so we have to look at it                                 from the point of view of the                                 terminology differences so this is the                                 critical factor in the in Canada we                                 register for exams in the u.s. we                                 register for assessments what we did                                 cruelly was retested a Canadian with the                                 American application and that's why he                                 was so confused he didn't understand the                                 language but it did point out the                                 importance of getting that language                                 right and then we have to handle roles a                                 good way to look at roles is in terms of                                 mindsets we have three we have the                                 student we have a parent we have the                                 teacher and the mindsets are registered                                 me registered my child or register my                                 students they're quite different they're                                 subtle it's a subtle difference but they                                 are different enough different that it                                 confused our user and he spoke verbally                                 or extensively about that                                 and of course they're all different                                 usage contacts                                 it's a life if life is a set of changing                                 roles if it's set of shifting mindsets                                 probably doesn't look like this in                                 graphic terms it probably looks more                                 like this our consciousness is shifting                                 from one set of tasks one set of goals                                 to another so in very crude graphical                                 terms it looks like a wavy line not a                                 flat line now applications try to mimic                                 that in a way so they try to accommodate                                 these these mindsets into a degree that                                 people will sort of resonate with it but                                 unfortunately doesn't always work out                                 because it's actually going to a                                 different pattern and we need to                                 understand why that happens this is                                 where it hurts roll ority designs allow                                 this harmonization to take place between                                 the narratives the user narratives                                 within the application and the                                 narratives of real life that the user is                                 simply passing through now within the                                 Drupal UX community we have some                                 obstacles with it one is it's                                 inconvenient but it's there the Drupal                                 defines roles differently than I'm using                                 it it defines roles as sets or                                 permissions that may seem like a small                                 thing but I think actually it's just one                                 of those things where it's it's it's an                                 unfortunate sort of lack of power of use                                 of that term permission sets are fixed                                 for any given user                                 rolls because they're shifting mindsets                                 can change constantly so if you're                                 trying to design a user interface that                                 accommodates those shifting mindsets it                                 doesn't make sense to use a fixed                                 reference point you cannot do it from                                 that fixed set of permissions you have                                 to look at it from the point of view of                                 what are the shifting goals are shifting                                 task sets that they're trying to get                                 through drupal also doesn't support the                                 ability to express idiomatically and                                 that's something I want to go into and                                 this is where we get we pick up the                                 other key this is where we going to get                                 into a little bit of technical stuff                                 what is a string I'm just curious does                                 anybody know what I mean what I say was                                 a strength could you raise your hand if                                 you do know and if if you don't know                                 could you raise your hand okay glad you                                 came this is a strength                                 a string is basically just a set of                                 characters bounded between quotes and                                 these are the things that end up on the                                 screen that's kind of the formal                                 structure of it now here's a thought                                 experiment if we think of strings we                                 have to of course think words which of                                 course is related to thoughts if you                                 think about the kinds of thoughts that                                 we have in our heads in this room there                                 might be certain words are sort of more                                 common in all of our heads compared to                                 another room next door where they're                                 talking about perhaps drupal security or                                 even theming there are different kind of                                 resonant spots in terms of the the terms                                 and sort of population densities and so                                 on so I use this metaphor this grass                                 metaphor to describe the idea that                                 thoughts actually come in clusters and                                 so therefore so with the words so with                                 all the terminology and so on and if we                                 look at it in front of point of view                                 what I see role oriented strings being                                 organized like there would be in these                                 kinds of groups where you can see some                                 kind of self-consistency but in Drupal                                 if you to look at where the strings are                                 arranged it looks like this this                                 presents a kind of practical problem for                                 you UX designers and if there's no                                 systematic way to go in there and                                 fine-tune any of those strings because                                 it's basically a hunt and Destroy                                 mission individually one at a time and                                 that's not cost-effective and it's not                                 likely to happen so therefore the wrong                                 strings end up on the screen                                 so what do we do about that let's go                                 into it a little bit deeper and see if                                 we can find a way towards a solution                                 strings have a secret life there's the                                 strings that you can see on the front of                                 the screen that's what the users see and                                 there's strings on the inside behind the                                 screen on the inside of the code that                                 users never see this is an example                                 plucked out of the code in Drupal the                                 string on the left found it in quotes is                                 the word name as a user you wouldn't see                                 that on the right in quotes is the words                                 blog entry that's what you're going to                                 see so there is that's where I got it                                 from and you can see all those read                                 words on the left are the words that are                                 internal and these are the words that                                 developers care very much about the                                 words on the right which are blue are                                 the ones that get on the screen and you                                 can see for example with the second one                                 there it's actually HTML HTML is                                 basically one long string so the thing                                 is these code strings the red ones                                 should never change unless there's some                                 kind of functional change intended by                                 the developer I think of the more as                                 nails you knock them into place to hold                                 things together in a specific way and if                                 you change that things fall apart and it                                 breaks so you can't change those strings                                 on the other hand the strings on the                                 outside the blue ones have to be                                 flexible otherwise we'll never achieve                                 those comfort levels so by definition we                                 have to be able to modify those they're                                 quite different in nature and character                                 there's a logical problem and that is                                 that all of those strings are really red                                 because they're all inside the code                                 they're all inside that field of grass                                 that are talking about and therefore                                 they're generally inaccessible to UX                                 design processes because it's really too                                 difficult to manage them like that                                 so this could be a complete disaster                                 except for one thing from early on                                 drupal has made itself a goal to                                 dominate the world which of course                                 required that it has the capacity to to                                 speak in different languages so it does                                 have a very strong language translation                                 function called the T function so if you                                 look at this again you'll notice that                                 the blue string on the right is actually                                 embedded inside a team function what                                 that means is that you can find them and                                 you can translate them but you can't                                 translate them into idioms or role-based                                 perspectives like that you can't nuance                                 in to that degree just change them from                                 English to French to spanish or whatever                                 so in terms of our exam registration                                 system that presents a bit of a problem                                 here's the the t function dimension we                                 have the original words my examination                                 and then we have a French equivalent I'm                                 not going to try and pronounce these and                                 a German one in the spanish one that's                                 that's how it works right now with                                 drupal that's the t function basically                                 in terms of the space of the words                                 already as soon as we take on the task                                 of building the site to work in america                                 in the u.s. we have a problem because                                 they use different terms and then t                                 doesn't really accomplish that it's not                                 designed to so the idiomatic dimension                                 is missing it gets even more complex                                 when you consider those roles that each                                 of these sets of terms each of these                                 pairs of terms in each language also has                                 to be modified to be comfortable for the                                 actual role the mindset of the the type                                 of user so we actually got a lot of                                 things to look after here to make it                                 comfortable in all instances                                 so why are we just restricted ourselves                                 to that one dimension of language                                 translation I think it's just because                                 it's been hidden because those strings                                 are in the code and people that care                                 about that perhaps don't know it that's                                 one reason why I'm giving this                                 presentation there's also a convenience                                 factor from the development point of                                 view it is a bit convenient or is                                 considered convenient to be able to just                                 type those words in as you're busy doing                                 the the rest of your work and you don't                                 have to do anything very complicated but                                 there's a problem with convenience this                                 is convenient for situations like this                                 but we know in you know extended use                                 it's a different matter it means you                                 know these things are actually bad idea                                 now the equivalent here where we've seen                                 this before we have seen this before                                 because not only have embedded strings                                 we have embedded styles we have embedded                                 scripts you know history we know that                                 the graphic designers would not allow                                 embedded styles to happen now we know                                 that interaction designers would not                                 allow embedded JavaScript to happen now                                 what I'm saying is that embedded strings                                 are no different that's the kind of                                 situation we're talking about                                 so if we want to go into those other                                 dimensions we have to go beyond the T                                 function so I want to describe how we've                                 approached this with our application of                                 my planet to address that real problem                                 that's you know that we need to fix with                                 the usability so basically the idea is                                 to extract these strings from the code                                 we need to go on a rescue mission                                 pulling out of there we do that by                                 substituting not user-facing through the                                 substitute for that what i would call                                 semantic keys what I mean by semantic                                 keys is that they they do two things                                 they describe the usage context for this                                 string and they linked the internal code                                 to an external file in our case we use                                 the file where the strings are actually                                 defined so we produce something like                                 this so what I mean by semantic is that                                 you can tell when it says label                                 underscore blog that it's probably a                                 label and it probably has something to                                 do with blog don't have to really guess                                 too much of that and therefore it's not                                 big surprise to see the blue words blog                                 entry associated with that then we have                                 another one label first name it's                                 obviously a label that's associated with                                 an input that gathers the person's first                                 name same with label last name then we                                 have a prompt something we asked a                                 question on the screen are you male                                 female we have prompt gender and we have                                 a couple of answers that they could                                 possibly give option underscore gender                                 I'll just go or mail and then the                                 equivalent for female so there's the                                 semantic sort of meanings on the left                                 that that actually i think is very easy                                 from the developer point of view to                                 simply describe those things as you're                                 doing the rest of the logic of your code                                 you don't have to think about the                                 meaning and the nuance of what the user                                 should be seeing there when we saw that                                 graph where the wavy line wasn't jiving                                 with the users real life it's because                                 the developer puts their mindset into                                 the user interface because that's what                                 they're forced to do in this system                                 that's why it disconnects from the user                                 experience so we also need to help the                                 developers here as well                                 I think this could be equally helpful                                 for them certainly i found out that way                                 my own experience so we can also handle                                 the role dimension through the use of                                 what is called a variable so that thing                                 over the very far right dollar sign role                                 is basically like a little box at in                                 that box it will be strings and the                                 string could be it's going to be one of                                 student parent or teacher and that is                                 glued to the piece on the left where is                                 its label blog underscore underscore and                                 that little dot there blues those two                                 things together so you end up with these                                 kinds of things label bloggers are                                 original one then you can actually                                 modify that string through this system                                 without changing the code you can get                                 access to a student version where it                                 says students blog entry and a teacher                                 version which says teachers journal or                                 whatever you want it to say you can                                 change those blue strings without                                 without risking breaking the code                                 without having to change the code                                 whatsoever so that means the strings are                                 free and accessible to UX design so                                 we've got these two usage contacts we're                                 dealing with idioms we're dealing with                                 roles we end up with basically these                                 kinds of strings for that one expression                                 my examination we've got it in two                                 languages in in Canada we got English                                 and French two languages in the US                                 English and Spanish and we've got the                                 three role sort of expressions of it now                                 we've done that through a module so a                                 module I wrote like we call it to the                                 user narratives module and I'll just                                 explain very quickly how it works it's                                 barely its job is to help us organize                                 those strings so it this is where the                                 grass is it's all in there in the random                                 order core and contributes we want them                                 to basically look like this where we can                                 get to them and tune them nicely                                 with what we do is we build a custom                                 adapter module and we use the user                                 narrative module to basically route                                 things through to the to this where the                                 string files are I should explain the                                 custom adapter module is simply good                                 it's it is custom this is not a generic                                 solution this this is where it's just                                 simply custom solution it's using the                                 form API which is basically going                                 through all the input forms pulling out                                 the specific strings that we want to                                 change and then routing them through to                                 a different place and that different                                 place is something that the user                                 experience designer can look at evaluate                                 discuss with the client and get those                                 strings exactly right for the situation                                 so we don't have to touch code so update                                 on the project this is                                             briefly touch on it this is one area                                 where it's the it's the students                                 perspective just before the registration                                 wizard this is how they would launch it                                 there's a register now button there it's                                 a fairly straightforward simple                                 interface is a button and basically a                                 list of previous exams or pending                                 requests for exams but when we get to                                 the parent is a bit different we have a                                 list and on the left it says manage your                                 family list so it speaks to the parent                                 in their language it says does the                                 family member have a student ID and it                                 says something that you can't quite read                                 about so the student's name but about                                 the child's name sorry and for the                                 teacher it changes the language to                                 manage your student list does the                                 student have a student ID add new                                 students so it's just speaking in the                                 right terms for that for that role it's                                 not huge it's not a huge difference but                                 it's just enough to make it comfortable                                 we're just shaping those pointy bits off                                 the shoes here so that's basically it                                 that's that's the concept those are the                                 keys hope that the doors are open and                                 what I'd like to see now is if we using                                 this knowledge could now start to have                                 new discussions about this concept to                                 see is it generally valuable and if so                                 what can we do in terms of evolving                                 Drupal to allow us as UX designers to                                 have ax                                 to those two additional dimensions so                                 that's my presentation I think I should                                 do this bit too that I think you're                                 supposed to do your homework here you go                                 to that place if you like it go to this                                 place and give us your feedback if you                                 don't like it you're                                                     the session you should have been in so                                 yeah I think we've still got time for                                 questions so if anybody would like to do                                 that                                 when you put the string into a specific                                 foul to define separately how do you                                 handle the search speaking from what                                 quantity of me as a developer at me as a                                 user experience designer as user try to                                 click search on the web so because the                                 string defined separately so the search                                 engine need to handle that well because                                 it's basically a resource file that the                                 the user experience designer has access                                 to in in a text editor you can simply                                 look through and find the string that                                 you want or you could search within that                                 it's just a text file so I've never                                 actually experienced a problem with that                                 and from the developer point of view it                                 also works because when you're looking                                 at the code you see the semantic key and                                 if you do a search three directories for                                 definitions for that I found it                                 relatively easy I haven't seen a problem                                 with that thanks for that I had a                                 question which is generally I needed                                 some information I don't know if this is                                 the right place to us but it's really                                 quick I also had a similar problem in                                 which i'm trying to make sure that i                                 don't i don't actually check out our do                                 Geo IP to check whether whether users                                 coming from but i want to make sure that                                 the language is suitable for american                                 english users and British English users                                 and so i was confused how to do this                                 because i was actually thinking should i                                 use google translate API and translate                                 everything on akron or how do you                                 actually approach this problem well                                 first of all this technique i should say                                 it comes from a desktop application                                 building i used to work for commercial                                 desktop                                 vendors and this was the standard                                 practice and there we would actually                                 treat that you know in the same way as                                 we treat translation we translate to                                 different languages as well so it can't                                 handle both those things at once one                                 story I've heard in terms of the English                                 versus American for example is that                                 amazon i think had this problem where                                 the word shipping didn't work in the UK                                 it just didn't make sense because we'd                                 say delivery and it's always small                                 things like that but as they add up it                                 alien eights the user and they get                                 confused of the ideas again remove those                                 pointy bits and just make it comfortable                                 so I think this this type of approach is                                 required you know across the board                                 basically if we're serious about                                 delivering that degree of comfort to all                                 our users so this is great in terms of                                 functionality I'm just thinking if you                                 have a very content heavy side and I'm                                 talking about something that's content                                 created and edited by users is there                                 automation behind this you know why                                 should yeah yeah that's actually a                                 different that's a different problem and                                 this doesn't address her at all this is                                 really about user interface strengths as                                 opposed you know pointing into that do                                 you know anything on that front that                                 that could possibly work with this                                 module for content yeah yeah just the                                 automation of translation i I'm afraid I                                 don't actually but hopefully maybe                                 somebody else does but now I've only                                 looked at it from the point of view of                                 the structural strings in the interface                                 but yeah it it's probably generally a                                 problem and I think in it always needs                                 some degree of attention and you know                                 search engines are great to help us                                 reduce the amount of time we need to                                 spend on it but ultimately we have to                                 take responsibility for those things                                 thanks for                                 my question is more from the UI designer                                 standpoint and speaking to your users                                 and what you are saying about idioms in                                 the language you basically use the term                                 role in two different ways how Drupal                                 defines roles with permissions and then                                 how the UI designer would define the                                 role from the users perspective we have                                 a very similar situation to what you've                                 demonstrated here and we reached a lot                                 of the same conclusions as you did                                 identify who you're registering first is                                 it yourself your child whoever and start                                 from there one thing I'm stumbling over                                 is the use of the term role have you                                 been in a situation where you've had to                                 expose the term role for example if                                 you're registering your child and they                                 have three different roles to choose                                 from I've stumbled over the word role                                 I'm just uncomfortable exposing that                                 word to a user in the context of our                                 application have you well my run into                                 that my interpretation of the word role                                 is it's kind of like she'll talk it's                                 not something I'd want to expose and                                 yeah same from here and I haven't found                                 the workaround for that word to expose                                 to the user I think it's an important                                 concept but I I see it as it always                                 translates to something very specific                                 for example in our case here it's                                 register me register my child register                                 there's always some specific expression                                 which is natural to the narrative aspect                                 the mindset and so I don't think there's                                 need to actually expose the word in that                                 kind of abstract way we just have to                                 focus on what is the flow of thought                                 that's probably going to be happening                                 and of course that we can measure by                                 talking to actual users okay yeah so we                                 probably nurse need to reword like we've                                 got a screen that says choose the role                                 you want to register for player coach                                 volunteer blah blah blah so we just need                                 to look at getting that out of there                                 yeah I think it's not uncommon as you                                 can probably see the story of in telling                                 here is that those words when they are                                 defined as part of the development                                 process what happens naturally is                                 development terms leak out onto the                                 screen and that's what often confuses                                 users what I'm suggesting here of course                                 is let's put a buffer in there                                 let's take control of that language                                 great thank you thanks in your in your                                 module or in your implementation do you                                 see I mean you see it it looks like what                                 we need here is a parallel so you have                                 roles in Drupal and then you have for                                 lack of a better term now narratives and                                 if you could add narratives like you                                 could add roles and and and possibly a                                 narrative could you know somebody could                                 have two different narratives and have                                 bunches of different bowls and now with                                 field of all entities and all of New                                 they can have we could do that but are                                 you working toward that or where where                                 are you on that I think yes I've been                                 wanting to work towards this for years                                 I've used the module in other websites                                 before just because it seemed to be the                                 right thing to do for example a year ago                                 had a situation where we did something                                 for science fair projects and we found                                 out at the last minute that the students                                 that were registering their science                                 fairs were actually much younger than we                                 realized we thought it was high school                                 it was actually junior school and the                                 teacher gave us a feedback they won't                                 understand these words because we used                                 slightly technical slightly complex                                 words it was no problem to change it we                                 had the string resource file we simply                                 changed it we didn't have to break the                                 code we didn't have a risk break                                 breaking the code so it's um it's just a                                 very useful tool in that sense and I                                 think it's a very you know it helps do                                 you risk all those things in terms of                                 where it could go i don't know this is                                 the first kind of coming out of the                                 closet in the Drupal community right so                                 we'll have to see where those if people                                 want it and hopefully with that                                  snowballs and and and that that is                                  registered we still would then have to                                  deal with the technical things and how                                  to keep developers happy because there's                                  obviously as a change for the developer                                  experience and we don't want to break                                  that because most of them are volunteers                                  anyway right so so we have to be careful                                  on both sides but for now the idea is                                  just to put out here and get those                                  discussions going                                  first thank you very excellent                                  presentation one of the issues that I                                  think that one of the other questioners                                  was asking that I also have a trouble                                  with is we have a large website for                                  multiple users how do you get to the                                  point where you can understand which                                  narrative they're coming from I think                                  it's talking to them isn't it it's um                                  it's always starts from that and if if                                  we have the time and budget to do that                                  it's much better I think isn't it                                  because they always and that's why that                                  one had had the ears right that's where                                  it really starts isn't it so they will                                  give clues you can't take I don't think                                  you probably find this as well I don't                                  think we can take use is literally when                                  they ask for things you really have to                                  sort of step back a bit and see you know                                  what I what's the goal not what was the                                  expression of the goal and I think all                                  of that is part of the design process                                  and that's where you start to formulate                                  a sense of okay generally are there cat                                  are there clusters of user types that we                                  can give a name to and ultimately it                                  sign into a variable like that one we                                  get so from a user interface perspective                                  how would you ask the user to                                  self-identify as for instance we're at a                                  university or college a faculty member                                  or a staff person or a student I think                                  it really gets down to asking them at a                                  very high level about their goals what                                  are you trying to do what gets anyway                                  and then certainly we'd want to avoid                                  asking them how they use a given                                  application because that's probably a                                  workaround so you know couch it in terms                                  of in an ideal world in that sunny place                                  what would life be like you know as you                                  carry out your job or you know do                                  entertainment whatever is right and then                                  you know listening attentively to that                                  too to see you know what are the                                  patterns that that have suggested                                  especially if you do let me the patterns                                  coming from multiple people of course                                  like you'd see something in common and                                  that's what you can actually build upon                                  I think                                  from a prior session we're looking at                                  entities and fields and all that's                                  changing and one of the thoughts that                                  came in my mind when you're talking                                  about this was fields are feel double                                  now so that might be you know possible                                  solution for an implementation of                                  something like this yeah I'm not going                                  to say I know a lot about fields having                                  a chance to look at the fields I here                                  yet but I'm very excited about the idea                                  that you can get into that degree of                                  articulation of data I think that's                                  really a good thing so I've two                                  questions the first question is you said                                  that a person could log in and have                                  multiple roles how do you deal with                                  something like that well what we did was                                  we used parallel sort of interface                                  mechanism like like checkboxes as                                  opposed to radio buttons or drop-down                                  selectors and then tabs within a                                  reasonable you know number you can                                  afford the real estate to do that you                                  know we could fit three additional tabs                                  in that space I've had other the thing                                  about roles is that there's always some                                  form of role switching there's there's                                  always some point at which the user                                  changes hats I've designed other                                  interfaces where there was a drop-down                                  system a drop-down menu where they could                                  look at things from quite different                                  points of view and but it was expressed                                  in terms that would relate to their jobs                                  so I'm going to do this now and then the                                  user interface changes somewhat to allow                                  it changes the toolset so there is a                                  kind of a conscious switch on the part                                  of the user I think in this case we're                                  picking it up on the implicit decision                                  when they go to a tab that's labeled                                  accordingly Mike family or whatever my                                  students there's an implicit role                                  selection there and then we keep that                                  knowledge inside the system and then                                  that's what flavor is the common wizard                                  that they all share in the appropriate                                  way so it's kind of like a default role                                  that you I I think you do have to build                                  for defaults as well                                  but what ideally you wouldn't let that                                  leak out too much the second is is this                                  going to be a project on drupal.org oh I                                  meant to mention if people are                                  interested we certainly be happy to                                  contribute the module and and set out                                  you know doing you know whatever follow                                  up tutorials or you know sort of helping                                  out with that that we can do so if                                  people are interesting that you know let                                  me know after and we'll well no I think                                  it'd be a good contribution thanks                                  sorry I'm not telling you know the                                  microphone is too tall yeah so I just                                  had a question um I'm from a university                                  and I'm interested in using this for our                                  faculty and students but I'm wondering                                  is there do you see any problem in terms                                  of instruction so if a faculty member                                  has a different view and they're trying                                  to teach the student how to use the                                  website they'll have to learn both sites                                  or both language and idioms so do you                                  have any suggestions on how to overcome                                  that or do we just tell them too bad you                                  have to learn both I may be                                  misunderstanding this but what I'm                                  thinking that has to happen first is you                                  need to have a developer build that                                  custom module yeah I'm assuming that                                  after okay so then so then the other                                  part is again to have the conversations                                  with the teachers right and with the                                  students and to find out what their what                                  their expressions are what are their                                  word sets and then to identify the                                  points you can do it you know with user                                  testing if you already have something to                                  test or if it's a mock-up you can do it                                  that way as well but find out where all                                  those difficult spots are and identify                                  those is the strings that you want to                                  actually you know modulate and then                                  that's what the your your developer                                  would focus on on doing I don't know if                                  I answered your question though thank                                  you okay thanks any more questions well                                  thank you so much I really appreciate                                  your coming and staying through the                                  whole thing thanks a lot                                  you
