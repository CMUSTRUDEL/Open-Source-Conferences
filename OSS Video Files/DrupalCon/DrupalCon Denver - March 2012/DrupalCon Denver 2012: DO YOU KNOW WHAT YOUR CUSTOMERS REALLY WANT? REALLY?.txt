Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR CUSTOMERS REALLY WANT? REALLY?
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	Over the last three years Acquia has had to make two key pivots, and half a dozen minimum viable products in it's business. In this session, Barry Jaspan will address the innovative technologies that lead to developing a platform as a service instead of another Drupal hosting solutions. He will also address how we used innovation accounting to develop a half dozen minimum viable products(MVPs) to reduce the uncertainty in our start-up. Kieran Lal will talk about our customer development techniques and how we moved through the 6 stages of a start-up to grow our business. These real world examples of lean startup techniques will address pivots, MVPs, innovation accounting, and business model types. We will show how by listening to our customers we were able to grow a sustainable business and keep our costs of acquiring customers below our lifetime total value.

Questions answered by this session: 
How can you use minimal viable products to learn your customers' real needs from day 1
What are minimal viable products, pivots and the business model canvas
What is wrong with alpha and beta release mentality
What tools do lean startups use to maximize learning about their customers
How can you use the business model canvas to run any project like a lean startup and prevent the-community-that-never-was syndrom.

	                              professional services teams hated the                               product as much as our customers that                               was embarrassing okay not the you know                               and this is this is sometimes the                               reality of people who build products is                               that you know it just doesn't get to                               where you want it to be right away so a                               few years ago Barry and I were employee                               three and four something like that for                                aquia and we had met at online through                                the Drupal community but we met in                                Barcelona in                                                     stealth mode with Acquia and we were                                actively in the process of raising our                                series a and we went ahead and we were                                fortunate over the next several months                                as we did some validation around the                                business that the Drupal market was                                going to be big enough to support a                                start-up servicing that community and we                                were fortunate to get a series a round                                of                                                                      that presented a really wonderful                                opportunity for us to build products for                                our potential future customers and I'd                                like for you all to take a moment and                                just think for a second what would you                                do if somebody were to particularly                                Tresor to come to you and sit down with                                you and give you seven million dollars                                and say let's go build some great stuff                                and get some customers it is it is                                really I remember the Karen and I and J                                Batson we're sitting in one room in an                                office in andover looking at each other                                saying who was going to pay us and for                                what and we like we knew okay Drupal and                                services but but what exactly we really                                had no idea so I wouldn tell you the                                story of of what we did but before we                                got there we didn't have when we started                                ah quia the insight of some of the great                                tools that are out there that are                                available for you today in particular a                                project that was released this last year                                called the startup genome that went out                                and interviewed in fairly in-depth                                process over                                                        what the code for cracking innovation                                and innovative new products was and in                                that in that paper and you can go and                                you can register for it and start up                                Gino and download and I encourage you to                                do so they found that startups move                                through six phases and if they move                                through those six phases in order                                they will be successful and if they find                                that they skip those phases they are                                unsuccessful that was the conclusion of                                the research and what they said was that                                you first to go through discovery then                                validation then efficiency then you                                scale and then you hit profit and then                                you hit renewal or decline and basically                                this is the core crux of the issue that                                we were at we add the money we had a                                baseline but we somehow had to get to                                this ideal killer product right and how                                do you get there do you get there                                through brilliance you get there because                                you're a genius do you get there through                                because you have great architecture or a                                great design do you get there by                                listening to your customers how do you                                get there right that's what I think what                                startup genome tries to talk about                                there's also been a great book that                                every executive at aquia as and our                                leadership team is required to read                                called the Lean Startup this has become                                very popular New Relic a lot of                                companies are offering this book for                                free to read but it's basically this                                idea of how can we develop products in a                                really efficient and effective manner                                quickly and they start and most of these                                are targeted towards technology                                companies but they start with technology                                commoditization right something a great                                tool like drupal which is a basically                                commoditized content management has                                commoditized social features has                                commoditized the distribution of content                                through channels so that's one and you                                all have access to Drupal and you can                                all come up with product ideas and go                                build a great product with Drupal but                                it's not enough to just have the                                technology the next thing is you really                                 need to come up with something called                                 innovation accounting which is really                                 how do you measure the innovation that                                 you you're building how do you go out                                 and design something and create it and                                 get some data about how it's doing and                                 then get a feedback loop we'll talk a                                 little bit more about that and then                                 that's not all not only do you have to                                 have great engineering processes but                                 you've also got to do something called                                 customer development and you got to go                                 figure out how to listen to your                                 customers and the cool thing about the                                 lean startup in the start of genome is                                 they found that customer the companies                                 that could figure out how to listen to                                 their customers correctly grew up seven                                 times faster okay so getting you know                                 growing really fast and maybe not                                 needing that next round of funding                                 something that's you know incredibly a                                 good opportunity and then last but not                                 least was another book in this in this                                 series by guy named Steven blank called                                 the four steps of the epiphany and it                                 was really about customer discovery                                 customer validation customer creation                                 and then building the company okay so as                                 we're talking about these things and                                 you're thinking about your customers and                                 you're thinking about your products note                                 these down and come back and research                                 them because you're going to find them                                 to be really valuable for the product                                 that you want build so for us when we                                 first started in this little office and                                 and over we reached out to two members                                 prominent members of the Drupal                                 community Mike Myers who had raised                                    million dollars to build out his website                                 now public and Ken Richert who had                                 worked for a large newspaper chain two                                 of the people who are building some of                                 the largest Drupal properties out there                                 and we brought them and flew them up                                   and over do you want to talk about what                                 we asked them I don't remember an exact                                 detail but you know we were we were                                 forming the basis of the first thing we                                 were going to offer which was the                                 support model right the doc we would                                 answer questions that you had about with                                 with the calling Drupal for your                                 enterprise and I remember we drew up we                                 wrote up on the board like                                          different things they might want from                                 aqua that they might want help with our                                 services and we told them you know you                                 have you have                                                          board however you want to distribute                                 your points and so we were just we're                                 trying to get from them like what is it                                 that you want what we came away from and                                 those very early meetings you know this                                 is like january-february march two                                 thousand eight was that the first major                                 impediment for these companies you know                                 these these two companies I mean they                                 had Mike Myers and that can record right                                 but a lot of other companies that wanted                                 to use Drupal didn't have these                                 well-known members or they're very                                 experienced members and so their concern                                 was i deploy the software and i have a                                 problem with it where am I going to go                                 am I going to post a message on the you                                 know the the ddoddo forums and the                                 mailing list and hope I get an answer                                 that wasn't enough for large companies                                 so you know hence we had we we landed on                                 this support model as the first thing to                                 do and so what we validated was and the                                 success the meeting was if we were to                                 offer it they would buy it or something                                 like it so we move to the next second                                 stage of the startup genome which is                                 learning and as a start-up you might be                                 thinking what am i learning is my job to                                 build a product                                 is my job to make a profit is my job to                                 hire employees is my job to get a great                                 team my job to disrupt the marketplace                                 and really as a start-up and we maybe                                 didn't know this at the time but we                                 really have we're answering two                                 questions number one can we build a                                 sustainable business a business that can                                 sell find itself keep going on with                                 customers and stay profitable and get                                 the payroll paid and then the second one                                 is should we build these products right                                 and really what we were doing is as a                                 startup this was an exercise of learning                                 how fast could we learn how quickly                                 could we learn how could we validate our                                 assumptions as part of our learning and                                 that drives a lot of what we're doing                                 and why you spend time with customers is                                 to really learn and so the biggest you                                 know the biggest cost time advantage is                                 that you know don't build features that                                 your customers don't mind right how many                                 people have worked with an engineer who                                 has a great idea for a feature okay how                                 many of you fail to sell it okay more                                 hands went up in the second question the                                 first question okay and so it's really                                 critical that you build something that                                 your customers actually want to buy so                                 so this is where we can describe the the                                 first major pivot that occurred to Aqua                                 the first bit of learning that you might                                 say we had foisted upon us so go to the                                 next slide so we still we decided okay                                 we're going to provide support and we're                                 going to do it through a portal called                                 the Aqua network but we don't just want                                 to be a support company we also want to                                 be a services company where we offer you                                 know we build products which provide                                 services to customers so we built this                                 thing called the Aqua network we hosted                                 it in an ec                                                              part of our story later on but so                                 through the Aqua network is how you                                 access your support so it was you know a                                 website that you logged into that you                                 can submit support tickets and then                                 we're thought okay we want to provide                                 some services what kind of services can                                 we provide and what we came up first                                 with was with you know customers want to                                 know that their websites are up so we                                 built the first service of the Aqua team                                 network which was the heartbeat service                                 did anyone in here was anyone here a                                 customer of aquia in before like                                      did you ever use the heartbeat service                                 all right I see a hand going up was that                                 useful to you at all                                 kind of thank you very kind so what we                                 learned we learned to really critical                                 things one is we put a fair bit of time                                 into building that service but we didn't                                 really validate very carefully whether                                 that was exactly what customers wanted                                 for a thing that measured the uptime of                                 their site in fact the way it worked was                                 only when your site ran cron did we find                                 out whether you know did we ping you and                                 check whether you were online and then                                 if your site didn't run cron like you                                 chose to turn it off for some reason we                                 would start sending you alerts that you                                 were offline you're like no I'm not                                 offline i just stopped running like it                                 didn't make a lot of sense we didn't                                 really do a great job of validating it                                 the other more important thing was that                                 we spent you know when we when we                                 brought ken and ken and mike my michael                                 myers up to aqua and ask them about                                 support we were asking them you know are                                 you interested in if we you know if we                                 support drupal and a certain core set of                                 modules and they said yes answering the                                 question we would like support for                                 drupal and there was this really subtle                                 disconnect that was happening that they                                 thought we were offering to support                                 anything in Drupal and we thought we                                 were offering to support a limited                                 subset of like core plus the top                                     modules or something and so we launched                                 the Aqua team network in September of                                                                                                         happened what we discovered that the                                 learning we had foisted upon us was                                 customers weren't interested in a subset                                 support for a subset of Drupal because                                 one hundred percent of them had a custom                                 module a custom theme something that                                 wasn't in our list something from the                                 long tail and so the box that we had                                 drawn over this word we were offering                                 did not fit any of them and you know the                                 sales Bell didn't ring for a couple                                 months at which point we engaged on our                                 first major pivot and so in if you're                                 not familiar with a pivot a pivot is                                 when you basically do a course                                 correction and you reevaluate whether                                 you should continue to develop the                                 product in the direction or do you                                 change right and so there are a lot of                                 good examples of companies changing                                 direction and I think the key point here                                 is that that first phase where people                                 who use Drupal really think about it's                                 like                                 I take Drupal and cloud amazing I've                                 combined two technologies that are                                 really cool now I have a product that's                                 successful right drupal + nodejs awesome                                 drupal + awesome drupal plus Redis                                 awesome you know pick your technology                                 and people will think that if they                                 combine the two google+ civvy crm                                 awesome you know and people think it'll                                 sell and we learned that it's more than                                 just you know the introduction of                                 technology and so they come up come up                                 with this concept called innovation                                 accounting as opposed to having a long                                 project roadmap with milestones and                                 total number of users and things like                                 that the idea is to really get a fly                                 wheel spinning of getting ideas and code                                 and data and learning and building and                                 measuring and the whole point here is                                 that when you're in a start-up or you're                                 building something for customers you                                 really have no idea what you're doing                                 you think you know what you're doing but                                 you really have no idea what you're                                 doing and so you're trying to reduce                                 uncertainty by spinning that wheel                                 really fast and getting around that                                 first loop of building something getting                                 it up to customers and testing and so                                 and so there's an actual engineering                                 process and some practices around anjel                                 development Minimum Viable products so                                 what we were doing this oh I'm glad that                                 was empty we were we were doing this                                 back in the summer of two thousand eight                                 we were using an agile software                                 development process called scrum and so                                 every three weeks we would have a cycle                                 where we talked about the features we                                 wanted to build and we build them in                                 that three weeks and then we deliver it                                 we'd have an internal demo meeting and                                 show it all everyone all the cool stuff                                 we'd built and we're still using that to                                 that to this day and it's actually a                                 really great development methodology but                                 I think looking at this at this slide                                 here of the innovation accounting what                                 I'm basically trying to explain is that                                 we didn't get this right in                                            did the build and even though we were                                 operating in a very fast agile process                                 we were we were shipping internal                                 releases so we were shipping new                                 releases internally every three weeks we                                 weren't shipping them to customers every                                 three weeks we didn't ship them the                                 customers until September notice that we                                 started in January so we'd spent way                                 away long time in that build loop and                                 then we finally shipped it and when we                                 hit that measure loop while I told you                                 what we measured what we measured was                                 zero very clear signal easy to                                 understand and hence we had that                                 learning box so                                 this is the this is the just the history                                 of how we went through you know learning                                 this the hard way anyway good and i                                 start up no fax exists inside the                                 building only opinions right and so when                                 we first started we we had started with                                 our CEO Jay Batson and we had a chairman                                 guy named Tom Erikson who's now the CEO                                 of aqua and Tom said he wanted to see                                 what we were doing and most of our                                 business model was based on inside sales                                 we would do some marketing people would                                 come to our website they see the phone                                 number they call we'd answer the phone                                 we sell them something right but then we                                 decided well there's a lot of people                                 using Drupal up there when we get                                 somebody on the field so I had been                                 running dribble cons for a long time or                                 for a while and knew a lot of people in                                 the community and so I decided to call                                 my friends at sony music and Tom said                                 you can go see sony music sounds like                                 fun I'm coming and so off we went to                                 Sony Music in New York City and I went                                 inside and hung out with all my friends                                 at sony music from Drupal cons and                                 staying up all night and drinkin beers                                 and jabbing and stuff like that and we                                 got in there and I presented our support                                 plan and they stood up and said awesome                                 we want support we use Drupal we've got                                 a couple hundred sites we want that                                 enterprise support will buy it and my                                 CEO said congratulations you have a new                                 job you're now our field sales guy at                                 Acquia and I was like what I want to go                                 back and be a community manager but the                                 point was was that we had an opinion                                 inside right that we could sell support                                 but it wasn't till we got to sony music                                 and then a drupalcon DC I'd been calling                                 the Obama campaign staff because they                                 had launched the office of management                                 budget through the White House had                                 launched recovery.gov and Barry and I                                 were on the security team and we were                                 terrified that the highest-profile                                 Drupal site of recovery job in the world                                 was going to get hacked and when we                                 pushed out a security release we had to                                 know that they were going to update that                                 code and so Barry was calling the White                                 House phone switch line and sane um                                 please could you get the Obama staff to                                 go an update update core and you know                                 there's nothing to that extent you

contact in the Obama                                 staff campaign staff letting us know                                 that that drupalcon is going to be in                                 town we really appreciate that you've                                 offered his tickets to come to drupalcon                                 and give us a tour but we're not going                                 to make it we're really busy like                                 totally understood like however would                                 you be willing to come to the White                                 House I'm like hmm hmm yeah I'm                                 available and so um so I went and I                                 grabbed Reese and summer you were there                                 you might have saw it on Twitter it kind                                 of got it on Twitter a little bit at at                                 DC and Driessen I off we went to the                                 White House now for the last five years                                 I come from IBM and had been doing                                 enterprise stuff in IBM Research so I                                 saw Drupal as this thing that was going                                 to mature so that big companies would                                 use it so we were really dedicated on                                 security we really thought hard about                                 architecture we took everything that we                                 were doing and when you look back where                                 we were it was ridiculous but we just we                                 just took ourselves really seriously and                                 worked really hard to make Drupal really                                 credible and so when we got to the White                                 House we laid out a roadmap of every                                 question we thought they would ask us                                 and so we basically said here's what you                                 got to do security here's what you got                                 to do for scalability here's what you                                 got to do for maintenance and management                                 and hosting and we just rolled it out                                 for them and then told them how to work                                 with an open source community told them                                 how they could come to drupalcon how                                 they could hire developers how they                                 could build their team and shortly after                                 that they agreed and I can't say a lot                                 about what we do with the White House                                 but I can say it that they did become a                                 very early customer of ours and they did                                 manage to deploy on Drupal and so yeah                                 that's we transition from an opinion                                 that we could do something to fact and                                 right around that same time is when we                                 made I'll call pivot number zero for                                 aqua which is we particularly talking to                                 these two customers and some others when                                 we finally figured out oh you know this                                 box that we've drawn around the support                                 that we're going to offer it's not going                                 to work right customers were hearing                                 something different so we made our first                                 pivot we called the object big tent                                 where we said okay now instead of                                 defining that we're going to support                                 Acquia Drupal and the top                                             we're going to support everything                                 anything Drupal                                                     custom code contributing whatever so and                                 that was a really major shift we'd spent                                 nine months with this model that we were                                 were going to it was like the equivalent                                 of red hat linux where they ship a                                 certain set of software and support it                                 we thought we'd do the same thing except                                 it didn't work so enormous shift the                                 exotic tire executive team was involved                                 to decide okay we're going to really you                                 know expand the definition and and then                                 we started getting some yeses like Karen                                 logistics planning so we started signing                                 up more and more customers and we                                 started supporting them and pretty soon                                 we started getting phone calls hey we're                                 supporting us but our servers are                                 offline hey Apaches down well we're here                                 to support Drupal we're not here to                                 support Apache we're not here to support                                 mysql I'm sorry that you only allocated                                                                                                          site but my xq el is not going to run                                 please go get a system administrator who                                 will tune your mysql and more and more                                 of those customers basically either                                 thought they could host themselves and                                 clearly couldn't or we're like we don't                                 want to host it ourselves and so we've                                 discovered you know pivot number two or                                 pivot number one button or he's got a                                 pivot number one if that was the other                                 one was zero was a lot of our customers                                 really needed hosting or wanted it and                                 so we found ourselves having to go there                                 and so this is a really interesting                                 thing because when you look at the start                                 of genome project one of the things they                                 say is there's a right amount of pivots                                 that you should have in your company if                                 you have zero pivots you probably                                 weren't listening and you're going to                                 fail if you have four pivots you've                                 probably changed your company's business                                 so many times you're out of cash and                                 you're going to fail so the optimal                                 number of pivots is to be around one to                                 two major pivots in your startup early                                 on and so you should be anticipating                                 that you were going to fundamentally                                 have to change the products that you're                                 developing and look as you're listening                                 to your customers you go there so change                                 significantly one to two times and so                                 the question is should we build this                                 product and Marc Andreessen for those of                                 you you know Mike not familiar with him                                 he's that was the original developer and                                 founder of Netscape he went on to build                                 a great company called op source which                                 had a massive series of layoffs in the                                 middle of the first recession and then                                 like miraculously                                                    turned around and sold it to                                 hewlett-packard for hundreds of millions                                 of dollars I don't know what he did in                                 those                                                            affirmed                                 self as a true visionary and he's gone                                 on to you know be founders and be                                 funders in facebook and linkedin and a                                 whole whole series of other ones and so                                 he says in a great market and market                                 with lots of real potential customers                                 the market pulls the product out of                                 start-up and that's what happened to us                                 we were trying to support people their                                 servers were failing and we just got                                 sucked into that business we just had no                                 choice to go there and so as you're                                 working with your customers on your                                 products you're going to find yourself                                 getting sucked into businesses that you                                 had no idea you were going to get into                                 probably even thought you didn't want to                                 get into so what are we trying to do                                 from a customer validation we're                                 basically trying to you know minimize                                 the total risk of failure by checking                                 your theories against reality okay and                                 so we got to this point where was like                                 okay we're forced into the hosting                                 business what are we going to do is                                 jason from red hot here no okay good i                                 can tell you the story now so Jason was                                 from Red Hat and Jason's job was to                                 basically print magazines glossies                                 brochures crack you know servo graphic                                 design background and they were looking                                 for a CMS and said we need to go get                                 into this web space a little bit more we                                 want to put up different kinds of                                 websites and I said well what's your                                 team look like and he says we're                                 effectively you know content people and                                 graphic designers and they did she had                                 no tech skills and so I said well let's                                 give it a shot would you like us to host                                 your website for you and they said oh                                 boy would we that would be great if you                                 guys could just take care of that and                                 make sure it all stays up that's great                                 and at the time we were building our                                 stack on a boot too and we said would it                                 be alright if we ran the Red Hat website                                 on a bun to know so we went out and you                                 know we had no choice so we stood up a                                 couple of Red Hat servers and Amazon Web                                 Services and we were in the hosting                                 business we were hosting part of Red                                 Hat's sites and then Barry started                                 building a product and he said I'm                                 building a product and it'll be ready in                                 six months or something like that I                                 think six months is what he wanted and I                                 said great I'm gonna start selling it                                 today and and so i was in san francisco                                 and i went i found a great customer                                 called mother jones that was having a                                 big website and i actually have been                                 working with them to get a case study                                 printed on the front page of drupal.org                                 talking about how great their website                                 was except they weren't really                                 comfortable with me posting it on the                                 front page of drupal at work because it                                 was kind of crashing a bunch                                 and they were like we'd really like to                                 get Drupal working first before we start                                 bragging about how great it is and I                                 said okay well how about we help you and                                 so they said great love to get some                                 application support from you love it if                                 you could host it or talk a little bit                                 about what happened then well so the                                 first thing I want to say is that if you                                 read the Lean Startup book they talk                                 they talk a lot about the Minimum Viable                                 Product and you know what can you do                                 that's the fastest thing that you can                                 ship to get any data any validation at                                 all got anything from the measurement                                 phase well it really kind of annoyed me                                 back in what was it may or so of                                      what I'm we're trying to build this this                                 hosting product and Karen went and sold                                 Red Hat on custom configured servers but                                 you then then we read this Lean Startup                                 book a few months ago and they described                                 I don't remember what the example they                                 gave him the book but it was some                                 company that was providing some kind of                                 like shopping service and their minimum                                 viable product was that like you would                                 submit on the web page that the products                                 that you wanted bought for you and it                                 was like you type them into a text field                                 and the CEO would print the list drive                                 to the store buy the products and bring                                 them to your house unbelievably                                 inefficient right but it but it gave                                 them the data that there were people who                                 are willing to shop online which they                                 didn't know before they had done that                                 validation well as annoyed as I was when                                 keiran sold this thing to red hat                                 because it was completely not what we                                 were building it did give immediate                                 validation that if we provided a hosting                                 service that there were customers for it                                 so I apologize then we brought on we                                 brought on mother jones and the so awk                                 we at the time had different levels of                                 support that we would sell we had our                                 enterprise level which was the                                 all-you-can-eat                                                        happens what you break doesn't matter                                 you know we'll wake everyone up to solve                                 the problem and then we had lower level                                 tears than that that were obviously                                 loseth less expensive you know we had a                                 professional level tier that had like                                 six tickets you know limited number of                                 drupal support tickets you could submit                                 and so we thought okay well we have this                                 hosting platform we'd like to sell it to                                 as many people as we can so we'll sell                                 it to anyone who has any of our                                 subscriptions you can have an enterprise                                 with support or you can have a                                 professional with support or maybe you                                 can even just have the I'm sorry                                 with hosting not with support you can                                 have enterprise with hosting                                 professional with hosting or maybe just                                 hosting just by itself you know and you                                 don't call us for drupal support maybe                                 you have your own developer team you                                 don't need our tech support and in fact                                 Mother Jones was our first hosting                                 customer and they started with just                                 hosting and then a few weeks after they                                 launched their site crashed now the                                 product our hosting product was brand                                 new the support team didn't really know                                 it that well everyone including us                                 including me we all sort of figured you                                 know it's probably our fault I mean                                 certainly we had found lots of things                                 where we put bugs in the system and it                                 wasn't very reliable but but the site                                 was down and so all hands on deck and we                                 went and debugged and debug debug did                                 eventually we discovered that they had                                 made a small change in Drupal core which                                 it turned out was a bit of a mistake and                                 that was taking their site down so what                                 we learned from that this was sort of                                 the second major pivot we had this                                 hosting product we were selling it we                                 thought we could sell it just to any of                                 our customers but when we realized okay                                 if we're selling guaranteed your site's                                 going to stay up and your site goes down                                 by the time we're done debugging the                                 problem maybe it's our infrastructure                                 maybe it's your code maybe it's your                                 custom module we have provided                                 enterprise support for that customer we                                 have you know Doug all the way through                                 the details of their custom code we                                 realized we can't sell this without                                 enterprise support because if we do                                 we're going to provide it anyway and we                                 can't afford that so second major pivot                                 I mean within two months of watching the                                 product was we just stopped selling it                                 for anyone who was not an enterprise                                 customer you could no longer by the                                 professional level of service with a                                 limited number of tickets and be on our                                 hosting platform and this will play                                 substantially into our conversation                                 later so again we're talking about the                                 four four steps of the Epiphany we're                                 working through our phases of customer                                 development and we're still on customer                                 validation and so our goal is to you                                 know find the minimum set of features                                 that we could require to get the early                                 customers and that's what we just talked                                 about the second thing is we want to                                 test the business model risk and                                 certainly you know when you build a                                 product and you launch it and you put                                 service levels around it some of your                                 customers are profitable some of your                                 customers you break even in and some                                 your customers you lose money on right                                 but the idea is you don't want to lose                                 money on all your customers and with the                                 scenarios that we were running to where                                 we were putting                                                          hours of debugging of top top tier edge                                 engineers we were losing money not on                                 everybody but on some of these it was                                 really clear that we were putting                                 ourselves at a business model risk and                                 so as we tiptoed into this hosting                                 business and it's signed all these                                 contracts to deliver hosting for a year                                 we started having some real tough                                 questions internally and you get to this                                 point when you've got a product called                                 persevere or pivot right and people in                                 our company were like we need out of                                 this business it is so scary to have                                 everybody in the company freaking out at                                                                                                         sites up it's so painful that we can't                                 do all the other things that we want to                                 be able to do maybe we should just get                                 out of here right and so you have to                                 make a decision and this is the great                                 failure or so many startups is unbounded                                 optimism is that we'll just try a little                                 bit harder we'll just put a little bit                                 more of the staff payroll on the credit                                 card we'll just stick it out for a                                 couple more months and keep burning and                                 maybe we'll succeed and can't do that                                 you'll die you'll die if you'll just                                 plummet right off the cliff into the                                 ground you've got to be prepared to                                 pivot and so that was a tough decision                                 and in this particular case I believe                                 passionately in this I think Barry                                 believe passionate it and at the end of                                 the day you know we chose to persevere                                 but don't take that decision lightly                                 okay well and yeah we persevered but                                 with with the pivot of we're only                                 selling this with enterprise support                                 right basically we were like we have to                                 be paid in order to do all this magical                                 work that we know we're going to do we                                 abandoned the the sell it to every one                                 part the business at that point so the                                 next stage the third stage of custom                                 development is customer creation and                                 what we quickly discovered was that                                 trying to guess how much hardware you                                 need to run a Drupal site that's                                 completely custom that may have                                     contributed modules that may have a                                 hundred percent of indicated traffic may                                 have a hundred percent anonymous traffic                                 may have thirty percent of the negated                                 traffic had a huge impact on whether or                                 not that site was going to stay up on                                 that particular amount hardware and so                                 we added an engineer to our team a guy                                 named Chris Yates to our pre sales team                                 and he                                 over and as part of that product he had                                 to go through in size every single site                                 before it went live to make sure that                                 there was enough hardware and the                                 customer was willing to pay for to keep                                 that site up and that was pretty tough                                 and so we see here we've got a baby                                 customer getting sized for a suit to                                 make sure it fits now what we found                                 early on was there were definitely                                 companies were very interested in our                                 product and on one end there were                                 startups and the startups were new they                                 were trying to move fast and they were                                 like if we can you guys can take care of                                 this will go focus on all that other                                 cool startup we're doing just run our                                 Drupal site for us the problem we found                                 was that startups were really                                 conservative with their cash and they                                 really didn't want to pay for service                                 levels and they also kind of sometimes                                 were a little bit sneaky about telling                                 us how big their sites were because some                                 of these were like social media                                 companies and so they'd be like oh yeah                                 during the Superbowl we're like the most                                 link to site on the Internet oh thanks                                 thanks for letting us know                                             advance you're going to need ten times                                 the amount of hardware right and so you                                 know they would crash or you know when                                 we said our site was Drupal what we                                 really meant was like it's mostly moodle                                 in like a million lines of custom PHP                                 code and I think there's like some pages                                 from it from Drupal Oh awesome thanks                                 for telling us right no wonder it's not                                 running well right and so these are the                                 kinds of problems we started with                                 startups and then on the other hand we                                 know we found you know some some good                                 places where enterprises they were like                                 you mean it costs less than a million                                 dollars because that's what the IBM guys                                 charge us and were like did we say                                                                                                   hundred thousand right they really this                                 is awesome we're going to move                                 everything over right and so sometimes                                 in sizing we also had a great thing a                                 great experience I got a call from                                 Disney Disney was using Drupal in a big                                 way they were using it for ABC family                                 they were using it for a bunch of the                                 properties that were using it for the TV                                 show The View and we were really                                 thinking awesome Disney's going to take                                 off on Drupal and we had a champion over                                 at Disney and there were a lot of                                 digital agencies that were delivering                                 Drupal sites for Disney and they                                 basically called us and said we want to                                 see if you can size Disney for drupal                                 and I was like amazing let's do it so as                                 me I get on a phone and there's like                                    scene                                 our                                                             architects and they're like we do                                    billion pages a month what can you do                                 I'm like well it's pretty scalable yeah                                 mm-hmm and so we're like trying to come                                 up with you know use cases like we did a                                                                                                        and you know stuff like that and like                                 does Drupal have a CDN built in and I'm                                 like no but there's a module but it                                 doesn't have CDN built in no but there's                                 a module it's not built in okay                                 therefore it's not scalable but that's                                 not really thank you it's not scalable                                 Oh hmm and so that's the way the                                 conversation went and I went to my CEO                                 and I said give me engineers we're gonna                                 build a billion page view a month                                 infrastructure and prove the Disney that                                 we can do this and he said no and I got                                 this really career level embarrassing                                 email back from Disney about what a                                 massive failure we had been in                                 convincing them that we could help them                                 deliver                                                               and that is hung over me like a cloud of                                 shame for about two and a half years and                                 then are in October I got a phone call                                 hi it's Disney we've been failing in our                                 CMS deployments for the last two and a                                 half years we've made a corporate                                 decision to move at all the Disney to                                 Drupal whoo and so we're back in the                                 game right and so Disney is now hiring                                 and failure maybe some of you are in the                                 audience some the Disney folks here in                                 the audience but they're hiring a lot of                                 rubble developers and they gonna build a                                 big platform and deploy a lot of Drupal                                 sites so trying to fit for customers and                                 trying to create those customers and get                                 that pipeline is a really important part                                 of the experience the fourth stage of                                 the marmar startup scale is to focus on                                 scaling and really what you're doing is                                 you're now at the floor stage of                                 customer development you're in the                                 company building stage and really what                                 your goal here is to validate your                                 founders beliefs J injuries believe that                                 we could create a company that would                                 help enterprises and large organizations                                 succeed with Drupal no matter what and                                 so we just put our heads down and tried                                 to figure out how to do that and that                                 meant tweaking the products and                                 adjusting the products and make it at                                 work but also meant we had to scale the                                 business now I was one guy and I went                                 out                                 I met Sony and I went out and I sold the                                 White House but that wasn't going to                                 work i mean i can only sell so much so                                 then we started building teams we                                 started hiring more and more sales                                 people and we had to scale them up and                                 then we had to do more and more                                 marketing activities and effectively                                 what you want to do is you want to build                                 a sales funnel right now how many people                                 have been the lead technologist and had                                 to go into the field and sell products                                 okay how many people have failed to                                 convince their salespeople to sell as                                 well as they do okay you see the problem                                 right so you got to figure out a way to                                 scale and get that funnel of sales                                 coming down through the pipeline okay                                 now in that startup genome report they                                 came up with some analysis that talked                                 about the theory of market types that as                                 a start-up through a series and the                                 startup that we were was called the                                 Challenger market type or the short guy                                 vignettes the big guy we're trying to go                                 up and take over the enterprise CMS                                 market and we're going to get our butt                                 kicked but that's the business model                                 it's an enterprise sales model                                 enterprise sales field force and that's                                 the way you go to market and we did that                                 and it worked pretty well for a while                                 but then we found ourselves in a                                 situation like wall-e where we were                                 persevering and persevering and stacking                                 that garbage higher and stacking that                                 garbage and put it in nice little neat                                  boxes for what felt like a thousand                                  years and then we kind of found out that                                  we needed to get into another business                                  so Barry's going to talk a little bit                                  about where we needed to target so so                                  when we last left our pivot story it was                                  it was October of                                                         were going to sell hosting only with                                  enterprise support subscriptions because                                  after all if we debug your site we're                                  providing that level of support and that                                  that led us down some very dangerous                                  roads we made at the same time we had a                                  lot of people in our company who are                                  doing another project called Drupal                                  Gardens including most of our visual                                  designers and so whenever we came upon a                                  question of okay we're adding this new                                  feature it's a really cool feature what                                  are we going to do for the UI how our                                  customers going to use it we said well                                  we don't actually have design resources                                  at the moment and it doesn't really                                  matter that much because every one of                                  our customers has an enterprise support                                  contract they're allowed to submit an                                  unlimited number of tickets and so you                                  know we'll put in the best user                                  interface                                  that we the engineers and I socket                                  designing user interfaces the best                                  interface that we can figure out and if                                  anyone doesn't understand the submit a                                  support ticket though how to be                                  explained to them and then they'll get                                  it great big mistake we were completely                                  failing to pay attention to our                                  customers two things happen one our                                  support team hated the product because                                  guess what it was confusing for them too                                  and they were always having to come to                                  us asking questions it made them feel                                  like it just wasn't a very good product                                  our customers were as we predicted we're                                  having to submit support tickets in                                  order to get basic thing bugs now how                                  many people in the room like submitting                                  a support ticket in order to do                                  something that's necessary for their job                                  yeah no hands no one likes likes asking                                  for support you want the product to work                                  you want it to be easy to use so we we                                  let ourselves by making this necessary                                  first pivot led us to this very                                  dangerous position where the user                                  experience of our product just wasn't                                  very good and the other thing we                                  realized around this time was you know                                  we're selling to enterprises but the                                  people who are building the websites at                                  these enterprises they're not the CIO                                  they're not the VP of Marketing their                                  developers and the developers who work                                  at an enterprise are just like the                                  developers that work anywhere else are                                  their programmers they like a good                                  developer experience just like anybody                                  else and we had simply completely failed                                  to build the product for them so this                                  was now towards the end of                                              made another major pivot so we'd had                                  this product we were selling it only                                  with enterprise subscriptions with I                                  don't remember what the prices were at                                  the time but five digit or higher prices                                  which meant first of all none of the                                  small developers could afford the                                  product which frankly was a good thing                                  because they would have hated it as you                                  saw that slide the very beginning of the                                  presentation where our own engineering                                  and p.s teams didn't like it because it                                  was too hard to use so we started in                                  January when we finally got the religion                                  we got this message that the experience                                  was no good and we crushed ourselves for                                  about two and a half months and                                  completely redesigned easier experience                                  added a whole bunch of automation for                                  things that previously our support team                                  had done for the customers wheel and                                  then we launched the the new version of                                  the product called death cloud a year                                  actually in chicago at drupalcon chicago                                  which was a huge improvement and we got                                  a lot of positive feedback and meant                                  that we lowered the price a lot so now                                  instead of a five digit price it was a                                  three digit price and then over the                                  summer you know we're selling the                                  product and things are going pretty well                                  but we start getting more feedback so we                                  had started building this product in                                                                                                     version control system that people were                                  using but in the meantime the whole                                  Drupal community had shifted to get and                                  we thought you know get svn they're not                                  really that different people can use svn                                  and didn't matter if we were right the                                  customers had decided and the customers                                  were speaking and they kept telling us                                  why can't I use git I want to integrate                                  with github I want to integrate with                                  Dido so after you know vainly trying to                                  argue that we were making the right                                  choice for a couple of months we finally                                  like you know the the product was pulled                                  out of us if customers forced us to add                                  this you know this particular feature                                  there were a few other things that we                                  did where when we started you know we                                  were still when we launched deaf Club we                                  were still kind of an enterprise company                                  so we thought all right we're just going                                  to sell for a one-year contract because                                  with our enterprise customers we'd                                  always sold one year contract well it                                  turns out developers don't buy hosting                                  in one year increments they buy it in                                  monthly increments and they pay by                                  credit card and we didn't have that                                  capability so over the summer of two                                  thousand eleven this was only last                                  summer right we imp we had there were                                  these major objections that we finally                                  started implementing and around the same                                  time we we got we got design resources                                  coming off of and usability resources                                  coming off the gardens project we'd be                                  on very frequent usability tests where                                  we put the product in front of the                                  customer have them try it have them tell                                  us all the things that were broken and                                  then the usability of people come back                                  to us with this nice report saying you                                  know here's the top six critical issues                                  and the top six you know major issues                                  and we started knocking those down one                                  at a time so that by the end of the year                                  by the end of you know                                                started seeing you our usability numbers                                  yeah here's an example you know that are                                  our usability people would hand back                                  things to us with like little arrows                                  saying this is terrible no one                                  understands and so by listening to                                  customers and iterating and doing these                                  ability tests every single time we                                  released the product we the story really                                  started changing and it was interesting                                  because you know we'd been bit we we'd                                  had this experience that was not really                                  that great for a long time and everyone                                  hated it and we got into a position                                  where we thought you know it doesn't it                                  might not even matter if we make you                                  know make the experience better maybe                                  people just going to hate us no matter                                  what I don't know we're the big guys we                                  rock we had but it turns out we listened                                  to the customers we started doing the                                  things that we said and the usability                                  score started going up and people                                  started liking it more so the the rapid                                  iteration of build a feature measure the                                  results with usability testing feed that                                  back in we've learned something and                                  iterate really started paying off and so                                  this brings us to the fifth stage of the                                  murmur stages of profit maximization                                  we've built the fundamental product now                                  let's just crank the wheel and sell a                                  lot more of it and by making it easier                                  to use we lower our support costs the                                  product goes out and profit maximization                                  starts to happen so we get to the last                                  stage of the six stages called renewal                                  and what we found was that some                                  customers enjoyed their experience but                                  often they would use a ton of support                                  when they first launched their site and                                  went live and spend the entire budget                                  that we might have had for that customer                                  and then as they got towards the end of                                  the year they would say you know things                                  seem to be working and whenever there's                                  the problem you guys kind of fix it so I                                  think we're done I think we're ready to                                  go on our own right and so they stopped                                  subscribing now not initially in huge                                  numbers but there was certainly someone                                  who were doing that and so we said it                                  you said you know we got that feedback                                  earlier about how good our heartbeat                                  module was and it was kind of like yes                                  all right right but then we started                                  saying well let's add a bunch more                                  things and so we started building at a                                  knowledge base because we had hired all                                  these people to do support and they had                                  all these great things so they had                                      articles that were in there and then we                                  started adding these tools like aqua                                  insight to help with configuration and                                  mobile I to do mobile and the lolla                                  lovats Drupal eyes me videos for                                  training and SEO greater and automated                                  testing and people started saying you                                  know what these tools are really great I                                  want to keep running them on my website                                  you know I'm going to renew because                                  they're awesome they're really                                  being a lot and then last but not least                                  was that classic support that we started                                  off with in the first phase and so our                                  renewal waits rent our renewal rates                                  went up and investors gain more                                  confidence and we were able to keep the                                  business going and hire more people and                                  so that worked really well so this                                  brings us back to those that's learning                                  phase and brings us towards you know                                  what we started off in the beginning                                  which is can we build a sustainable                                  business right and so many startups                                  start and they build absolutely amazing                                  products and they take them to market                                  and they do a ton of marketing and they                                  get app hire a bunch of expensive sales                                  people and they rush out into the market                                  and it's very successful and then they                                  run out of cash because the cost to                                  acquire customers for the marketing                                  campaign and the sales people and the                                  initial product was so expensive that                                  the lifetime value of that customer                                  whether that customers going to be there                                  for a year or two years or three years                                  or five years whatever it is just                                  doesn't balance out and so startups run                                  out of money even though they've got a                                  killer product even though they've got a                                  killer team even though they have a                                  great market that it can be selling into                                  and so getting that right balance of the                                  cost to acquire a customer and the                                  lifetime value is something that you                                  have to be thinking about as you get                                  ready to listen to your customers and                                  build products for them what I want to                                  leave you with and what I want you to                                  think about is that as you take Drupal                                  and you use it to help your customers to                                  build products to solve problems that                                  they have to build solutions for them                                  it's not just about Drupal in the cloud                                  it's not just about Drupal in some other                                  technology stack you've got to get an                                  engineering process in place that's very                                  fast very iterative and you really start                                  listening to your customers and you                                  listen to them and you measure that                                  listening and you get that feedback back                                  and at the same time you're also                                  thinking about how am i building my                                  customer base how am i doing discovery                                  how am i doing validation how am I crust                                  of creating my next generation of                                  customers and how am i building my                                  company today we're really happy to tell                                  you we've got a lot of amazing and                                  incredible customer                                  and we really appreciate how much effort                                  and time and patience they have given us                                  not only the funding that they've given                                  us but they've stuck it out with us and                                  said we like you guys we really want to                                  see you succeed and they have taught us                                  a ton despite ourselves we finally                                  started listening and I mean I think we                                  were listed trying to listen but maybe                                  not as listening to effectively as we                                  should have been all along and I hope                                  you take away from this that you can                                  create the processes that allow you to                                  learn from your customers and and launch                                  a million great products it's been a                                  really exciting time I know aqua kinda                                  has an interesting position in the                                  Drupal community with drinks being the                                  founder but I am really happy to tell                                  you that this year we saw Connor Sky's                                  Ray's five million dollars we saw                                  Pantheon raise five million dollars we                                  saw datasphere raise eight million                                  dollars we've seen web form launched a                                  couple of weeks ago we're seeing more                                  and more Drupal companies succeed get                                  this idea get that quick feedback                                  they're taking Drupal they're building                                  products around Drupal and they're                                  taking it out to the marketplace they're                                  proving that investors are seeing what                                  they're doing and they're saying we love                                  what you're doing your customers love                                  what you're doing we want you guys to do                                  it forever here's a check so there's                                  promise I hope when we come back next                                  year it won't be for customers for                                  companies that got funding I hope it'll                                  be                                                                       read these books and you follow these                                  processes I think that can really happen                                  so thank you very much for your time be                                  happy to take some questions                                  got a question if you could come up to                                  the mic because it's being recorded so                                  that yawning or quietly okay great so I                                  when you were you were explaining things                                  I was actually it was it was funny that                                  I was comparing this to like design and                                  our interface design process that we go                                  through where people don't know what the                                  heck they want a lot of times and so you                                  just throw something out there and then                                  based on the feedback you start morphing                                  into something that they actually can                                  use or that they actually wanted but                                  they didn't realize what they wanted                                  until you actually put something out                                  there but I did want to ask like with                                  your pricing like when someone's like oh                                  I wanted to hosting or something like                                  that what was your what was your                                  experience with the pricing did you did                                  you end up always under selling or in it                                  or were you overpriced or or how did                                  that go and how did you learn how to key                                  in on that it's been a really                                  interesting experience the first time we                                  tried to sell any hosting I went to my                                  head of professional service as I said                                  what's it going to cost to set up a                                  website in the cloud and he said the                                  setup fee will be ten thousand dollars                                  and I was like oh god you've got to be                                  kidding me ten thousand dollars I can go                                  to godaddy for                                                           but you know then I started to really                                  look at the market and see what people                                  were doing to set up fairly                                  sophisticated clusters of servers get                                  all the tooling around there and I                                  realized oh wait what does a drupal                                  developer make these days does a drupal                                  developer make thirty five dollars an                                  hour does a drupal developer make fifty                                  dollars an hour as a drupal developer                                  make                                                               developers making three hundred dollars                                  an hour oh yeah I guess if it did take                                  four days or it took three weeks to set                                  it up maybe that's not so bad and then                                  I'd go out to customers and when I go to                                  customers today and I say hey who's                                  doing your hosting they're like big                                  systems integrator company I'm like well                                  what are you spending and they're like                                  for four boxes were spending about a                                  million and it takes three weeks for                                  them to get back to us I'm like you're                                  comfortable with that and they're like                                  well they've got a couple of security at                                  a price features and that's the only                                  choice and we're you know we save money                                  because we buy an aggregate                                  like really so those are real                                  experiences between that and I feel more                                  comfortable today where you know $                                                                                                              you know customers where its                                  multi-million dollars to host all their                                  stuff but it's been painful answering                                  that a slightly different way figuring                                  out the pricing is really it's you know                                  a build measure learn loop all of its                                  own you know when we started and                                  figuring out the pricing model to so                                  when we started with hosting something I                                  didn't talk about was when we first                                  brought on our first customers we were                                  on a shared we were the magically the                                  the idea was to build a mesh a grid                                  right where we would have all of our                                  customers on one system and they could                                  buy slices and so you could buy one                                  slicer you could buy                                                     how big your site was and we were                                  pricing it on that and so as Kieran said                                  you know a Drupal site you can have a                                  million page views and it can take                                  almost no hardware because it's all                                  anonymous static cash or you can have a                                  hundred thousand page views and you can                                  require a ton of hardware because your                                  views queries are really complicated                                  whatever so we tried to figure out you                                  know how do we how do we sell this to                                  customers and we decided to price it in                                  terms of page views because customers                                  understood page views and clearly more                                  page views as more value so we just said                                  okay a slice i think it was like a slice                                  was half a million page views or                                  something like that and then a slice at                                  a price and you could buy over many                                  slices you wanted and that just turned                                  out to utterly not work because because                                  you know the page views didn't really                                  correspond to what your requirements                                  were and the customers didn't really                                  understand it and then we had the                                  support thing so you know we iterated on                                  the pricing model lots of times in fact                                  right now we're in the middle of a major                                  iteration on pricing with devcloud when                                  you buy a devcloud subscription you have                                  you can have three sites on that account                                  or ten sites on that account and if then                                  you can buy another subscription for                                  three more or for ten more at different                                  levels and we've been doing that for a                                  year and starting around last fall we                                  were getting very clear messages from                                  from the customers who actually loved us                                  the most and they said this is terrific                                  but like how come I have to break it up                                  into section                                  of                                                                       I'm kind of losing money for a few                                  months until I need                                                    know and then I'm breaking even again                                  and then the last four I'm profitable                                  and then I need to buy another                                          what's this about so we're shifting over                                  the pricing model again to be per site                                  which is just you know our customers                                  beating us on the head saying this is                                  not how do we want to buy the product we                                  want to buy it this other way it's our                                  money so we do what they tell us if you                                  found this you know our talk about not                                  listening to customers in user                                  experience Lisa and our mash are two

              Drupal and they also do some stuff in                                  our products they're doing about a                                  hundred different usability studies here
