Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: DESIGNING FOR MEDIA PLATFORMS
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	A standout strength of Drupal is its flexibility for large scale media entities that produce a variety of content for a variety of mediums. These websites are far more complex than the average brand or blog site. With that comes a unique set of challenges that lend themselves to this kind of design. This presentation will feature two case studies from TakePart.com and TheWashingtonExaminer.com, and reveal the real-life challenges these designers faced head on.

Questions answered by this session: 
What are design challenges for media platforms?
What are considerations when using responsive design for media platforms?
How do you navigate common missteps in the design process?

	                              we're going to be talking about                               designing for media today and I'm going                               to talk a little bit about what exactly                               designing for media is how many of you                               guys here our designers oh wow most of                               you okay developers I saw some of the                               same hands so are you designers and                               developers all you guys raise your hands                               okay great so this is this is really a                                talk for designers but are there any UX                                designers in here would you identify                                yourself specifically so today we're                                going to talk a little bit about the                                visual design process and the UX design                                process I think it's gonna be a very                                special kind of angle that we're going                                to take today with designing for medium                                I want to introduce you guys to Dave                                Leonard Dave works with me quite a bit                                on several projects and were going to                                talk about the projects we work on                                together yeah i'm david from phase sue I                                lead the analysis and UX team so we're                                responsible for a lot of requirements                                gathering content strategy analysis                                planning for content migration and                                integration with other content providers                                and my name is Samantha Warren I also                                work for phase                                                         find me on twitter at samantha toy feel                                free to hit me up if you have any                                questions after this or if you just want                                to follow me and I tweet a lot about my                                cat I'm a visual designer and when I say                                visual designer it's a little bit                                different than in New York's designer                                and we're going to talk through some of                                the responsibilities and roles that we                                have on each of the individual projects                                specifically these media projects that                                we worked on in the past we are located                                in Alexandria Virginia i'm actually in                                san francisco but when Dave and I work                                together we're usually working out of                                the Alexandria office we do a lot of                                telecommuting at phase two technology we                                specialize not just in media designing                                for media but we also do a lot of online                                publications which to some extent is                                media government websites and community                                websites at phase two we love beer cats                                and each other                                today's presentation killing me today's                                presentation I'm going to first talk a                                little bit about with designing for                                media means what makes it different than                                just designing for anything else we're                                going to talk a little bit about the                                washington examiner as a case study it's                                a project that Dave and I worked on                                together and then we're going to talk                                about take part as another case study                                two very separate media case studies                                with similarities and their differences                                we're going to talk about the concepts                                behind many of the decisions we made the                                challenges that were similar the                                challenges that were different and then                                we're going to open everything up for                                questions so what does it mean to design                                for media designing for a site that is                                meant to reach a large audience with a                                daily content cycle if you look at a                                blog or a commercial website brochure                                site these are all sites that may not be                                updated on a regular basis but when                                you're talking about designing for media                                you may be designing for content that                                has a weekly or maybe even daily content                                cycle we're really talking mostly about                                designing for content and what makes                                media different is just the sheer amount                                of information you're dealing a lot with                                tons of photos videos and a lot of body                                copy lots of typography and a lot of                                organizing information in a way that                                makes it very readable and usable to the                                user and then there's advertising the                                most exciting part of designing for                                media for a designer it's sort of the                                elephant in the room something that you                                have to deal with and we're going to                                talk a little bit more about that later                                on the presentation but I think for me                                one of the biggest challenges that we                                face is kind of thinking wrapping our                                minds around designing for a frequent                                publishing cycle and what that means the                                flexibility that you provide the content                                 creator with designing for a frequent                                 publishing cycle so today's case studies                                 are going to be take part and the                                 washington examiner how many of you guys                                 are familiar with either of the two of                                 these these organizations okay                                 you of you that's great take part um how                                 many of you guys have seen waiting for                                 superman or the cove or the help which                                 one contagion um so participant media is                                 a great organization that really tries                                 to spawn action there you have a movie                                 production side of the house but they                                 also have an online site that produces a                                 lot of content and they're very                                 action-oriented so take part com is                                 actually their online organization to                                 try and spur action amongst their                                 readers the visual design goals when                                 approaching takepart com were they                                 really wanted to exhibit great                                 storytelling and this is a common theme                                 when you get to designing for media they                                 wanted to compel their users to take                                 action this is a little bit different                                 than i would say than other media                                 examples because if you talk about a                                 newspaper or a magazine you're not                                 necessarily trying to get your users to                                 do anything once they read the content                                 but take part is specifically trying to                                 engage their users trying to get them                                 involved in the community and then the                                 last thing is promoting sharing and i                                 think that is a very common theme making                                 sure that the content that's created                                 doesn't just live at that site but it                                 lives all over the internet and that                                 people are eager to tell their friends                                 about it so and kind of as an extension                                 of that you know a lot of the user                                 experience goals were really to kind of                                 find creative ways to compel people to                                 take action so on the old version of the                                 site you know there was a page that                                 listed here are all the latest actions                                 that you might do and it wasn't really                                 as effective they found as you know                                 promoting an action within the context                                 of some kind of story that really                                 provided more background and rather than                                 just you know putting a link at the end                                 you know putting a link you know sort of                                 arbitrarily or some kind of you know                                 really called out treatment right in the                                 middle of the story that compelled that                                 user to take action another thing that                                 was really important and it's something                                 that we're seeing more and more of is                                 the idea of kind of supporting the ebb                                 and flow                                 of a particular topic so you know a                                 particular topic like food could start                                 out as a tag and then over time you know                                 they may want to put more of an                                 editorial emphasis on it and stand up                                 more of a partially curated and                                 partially automated page to really kind                                 of call attention to the best content                                 that they're writing about those things                                 and then design you xfer editors to so                                 you know on a lot of these sites that we                                 work on you know the UX for the end user                                 is very important but the people who are                                 really using the system very heavily on                                 a regular basis to do a lot of really                                 important curation it's really important                                 that that's very intuitive and                                 straightforward process a process that I                                 use um is last year at drupalcon Chicago                                 I actually talked a lot about my design                                 process and one of the things that I use                                 in the design process is a tool called                                 style tiles and if you want to go ahead                                 and take a look at style tiles you can                                 go to STI l dot es um website online                                 it's a process where I actually engage                                 the client and asking a lot of questions                                 about their brand and then I help them                                 to develop a common visual language so                                 that me as a designer can be on the same                                 page as the client for what they're                                 looking for so I go into the process by                                 either conducting an interview with the                                 stakeholders or I conduct a virtual                                 intern interview via a survey and these                                 are some of the adjectives that I got                                 back when I asked to take part about                                 their brand and what they wanted to do                                 with our website so words that I got                                 backwards were engaging hierarchy                                 spacious action-oriented community these                                 are really they're not necessarily                                 adjectives but they're descriptive words                                 that told me what they were looking to                                 do with the visual design of the site                                 and when take part came to us this is                                 what their site looked like originally                                 and what's an interesting factoid about                                 this entire project is that when they                                 approached us they actually we're                                 looking more for a realignment rather                                 than a redesign they weren't looking to                                 change colors or fonts or brand they                                 just wanted to                                 sort of kind of get everything cleaned                                 up and put into a better hierarchy but                                 after I conducted the interview I put                                 together this is one of my style tiles                                 it's basically I call it paint chips                                 fabric swatches of the web it's kind of                                 an idea for like getting getting samples                                 of an interface design out there so the                                 client and I can have a discussion                                 around what they're looking for so i                                 created this tile tile that represented                                 what they were asking for which was a                                 realignment of their current site it's                                 very similar colors very similar brand                                 it would really just be putting a lot of                                 their stuff on a grid but the curious                                 thing about this project was while the                                 client was asking for realignment they                                 were actually using words that did not                                 describe their brand they were using                                 words like editorial content focus                                 circulatory of spacious and so I decided                                 to give him another style tile that sort                                 of expanded upon their brand and made it                                 a little bit more editorial like um and                                 then I actually decided to go out on a                                 limb and take some of the words that                                 they used and really do something a                                 little different I gave them new color                                 scheme I actually changed their logo to                                 black and white this kind of idea of it                                 being really punchy I'm a publishing                                 kind of punchy feel to it and bright                                 colors to reinforce the idea of action a                                 very youthful feel and in the end they                                 actually really wanted to go with the                                 spinal style tile and the visual design                                 ended up esket oh and then we're going                                 to actually go through the next process                                 part of the process to talk about the                                 visual design in the UX all right so you                                 know in parallel what we're having a lot                                 of conversations around brand and you                                 know to what extent we wanted to keep                                 certain things intact and explore other                                 ideas we were also having a lot of                                 really in-depth conversations about                                 content strategy for publishers                                 specifically I mean I think they're                                 their visual design and their user                                 experience is really just an extension                                 of their fundamental content strategy                                 you know so we had a lot of                                 conversations about different types of                                 content they had how other content was                                 interrelated how it needed to be cross                                 promoted so for                                 since you know there might be one                                 content type called video and another                                 condoms I've called article and they                                 might want to cross promote that video                                 within an article but in sort of an                                 arbitrary position so we did some work                                 with some embeddable modules to kind of                                 facilitate how we would theme a note                                 that was embedded within the body of                                 another good for example creation                                 requirements that was a huge piece of it                                 you know I think they really recognized                                 the value in the curation that they                                 provided rather than just being a stream                                 of the latest things you know having an                                 editor really hand-picked these things                                 that are really going to engage readers                                 and really compel them it was really                                 important to them but at the same time                                 you know we had to balance that against                                 what their actual curation capacity was                                 so you know to what extent do they                                 actually have you know editors who can                                 stay on top of curating content on a                                 regular basis for all of the different                                 verticals and topics that they wanted to                                 demonstrate expertise in and then                                 another thing was campaign so a lot of                                 the the work that they do that                                 participant media does is produced these                                 films that raise awareness around                                 various issues and how those films were                                 sort of manifest on the website via the                                 campaign process was a really really                                 important part of the content strategy                                 and it was very heavily formed by you                                 know the existing campaign concept                                 because we had to migrate you know                                 existing campaigns over to the new site                                 and keep them largely intact but sort of                                 try to find ways to work them into the                                 new design cues that we were exploring                                 so once we really had a solid idea of                                 what their common strategy was and what                                 the content structure was that let us                                 you know start doing a lot of wire                                 framing and one of the things that we                                 did on this particular project that I                                 thought worked really well was you know                                 Samantha and I were both kind of                                 involved in a lot of these conversations                                 and we sat down and did pair wireframing                                 at the same time so you know one of the                                 classic struggles that you have with you                                 know with the interaction between a UX                                 designer and a visual designer is you                                 know to what degree of fidelity do we                                 actually want to create these wireframes                                 like do we want them to be super loose                                 or do we want them to be you know a                                 little bit more specific and you know                                 when we were doing this pair of wire                                 framing exercise you know we really had                                 a sense for I had a sense for you know                                 how detailed she needed things and                                 what to be careful about being overly                                 specific about etc so I mean that really                                 cuts down on the number of revision                                 cycles and it creates a much you know                                 better working relationship because it's                                 not like I'm just going to create                                 something and then drop it on Samantha                                 and say alright here's how it's going to                                 look so you know she wasn't involved                                 very heavily in the design process and                                 we were literally sitting down like pair                                 programming style and putting the                                 wireframe together in real time and I                                 think one thing to note here is that the                                 visual design process that we walked                                 through with the style tiles it's going                                 on in parallel to the wire framing                                 process there's a lot of overlap between                                 I'm constantly consulting Dave about                                 what I'm doing on the style tiles and                                 he's constantly consulting me about what                                 I'm doing or about what he's doing on                                 the wireframes so I think the final                                 wireframe came down to being this this                                 is example what the homepage wireframe                                 looks like and then once I came in and                                 worked through the visual design with                                 the client it ended up looking like that                                 so that's that's take part case study                                 which we're going to go back and revisit                                 some of the specifics in a moment but                                 I'm going to go through next the                                 examiner the washington examiner how                                 many of you guys are familiar with                                 washington examiner okay so it's a local                                 newspaper in the DC area that has a rich                                 history you can see here by their logo                                 it's it's definitely a historical logo                                 it was it was created by william                                 randolph hearst and they actually have a                                 very strong tie to the political climate                                 in washington DC if you guys are from                                 Washington or ever visited you know that                                 just about everything in DC has a bit of                                 a tie-in to the political climate so                                 some of the visual design goals that we                                 determined early on in the in the                                 process it needed to feel modern this                                 was really important especially with the                                 election coming up in                                                  feeling that it needed to be very                                 updated really important that it stayed                                 true to the history of the brand there                                 are readers who've been reading the                                 examiner for years and years they wanted                                 to make sure that                                 they felt as though this was still the                                 washington examiner spank brand and it                                 needed to be very easy to use and easy                                 to read readability is a major piece                                 they wanted their content to show                                 through so it needed the visual design                                 needed to support that so from sort of a                                 strategy in a new extend point I think                                 some of their biggest goals were related                                 to demonstrate the the breadth and in                                 some cases depth of their coverage so it                                 was very highly section based and                                 they're a little bit unique so you know                                 they're they cover a lot of local news                                 you know whether it's about education or                                 real estate or you know local government                                 issues and all those kinds of things you                                 know for the DC metro area but they're                                 also really well respected you know                                 nationally in terms of their political                                 coverage so you know even though they                                 had a very wide breadth of coverage                                 there are certain areas where they                                 really wanted to put more emphasis so                                 that not all the sections were really                                 the same and similar to take part I mean                                 that you know the promotion of the top                                 quality curated content was a really                                 really big goal for them that actually                                 you know created a few challenges in                                 terms of you know image handling and                                 some of those other things because in a                                 lot of cases you know you wanted to make                                 one set of curation decisions like these                                 are the top five stories of the day and                                 they need to be cross promoted in                                 various areas of the site so on the home                                 page they have a really large treatment                                 on other pages like an article if you                                 landed on an article from a Google                                 search or something like that you you                                 know want people to miss out on the top                                 five stories because their own the home                                 page so we had to repurpose them there                                 and so you know things like emphasizing                                 and ratios and stuff like that were                                 really really important conversations we                                 had along those lines and another thing                                 that was really important to them was                                 really showcasing you know the talent                                 they had in terms of the authors that                                 they had in house this was a little bit                                 challenging because there were so many                                 different sources of content coming into                                 the system so there was content that was                                 being created directly in Drupal there                                 was content that was being piped into                                 Drupal through some food processing work                                 that we did from a system that was used                                 to create their actual newspaper and                                 then there was also like heats coming in                                 from The Associated Press that they were                                 using to supplement their coverage on                                 some of the areas that they weren't                                 writing as much original content for so                                 we've got all these different data                                 sources and authors are sort of handled                                 we in those different data sources so                                 you know rather than you know creating a                                 bunch of different templates for all                                 these different scenarios we had to find                                 some rules around like you know what                                 does an author look like if it's just                                 you know an organization or what does an                                 author look like if it's a blogger who's                                 really high profile and all those kinds                                 of things were really important from a                                 design and from a strategy standpoint so                                 we conducted the survey just as we did                                 with take cart and a lot of the answers                                 we got here we'll really colorful I                                 can't recommend enough if you work ever                                 with publishing the publishing industry                                 and you get the chance to talk to the                                 publishing organizations top writers you                                 can get some really great words and                                 adjectives out of them and I think here                                 one of the major things that they really                                 stressed is that they wanted it to be                                 local and not necessarily visually you                                 know washington d.c local but the fact                                 that it it really highlighted local                                 content again the political the                                 political side of things really needed                                 to show through other words that were                                 used were like decluttered flexible                                 dynamic regional and speedy and speed is                                 an interesting word right it's very                                 valuable in the idea of they want it to                                 look speedy but what does that mean so                                 kind of opening up that conversation                                 into something degree once I did have                                 some back-and-forth with them speedy                                 kind of meant they wanted to see a lot                                 of white space this is what the                                 washington examiner looked like before                                 we started the project and what we                                 actually did um before then and this                                 this kind of comes down to every                                 situation every project is unique in                                 some way and this project was unique in                                 the fact that we actually did a smaller                                 engagement with the                                 washingtonexaminer.com before starting                                 their main site and in this situation it                                 was the campaign                                                        to look again very modern up to date but                                 had much more of a political slant to it                                 so we had this as a very major factor in                                 moving forward with the dot com site                                 because a lot of the stakeholders really                                 pointed to the things they liked on this                                 piece of the puzzle                                 and so moving forward if you want to                                 take a look at the style tiles that were                                 presented to the client here um there                                 were three style tiles which you can see                                 they're three very similar style tiles                                 in this situation because we kind of                                 already narrowed down very specific                                 things they liked in the fact that we                                 had conducted several surveys up into                                 this point with the smaller site and we                                 knew exactly what they liked or didn't                                 like about the site and what you see                                 here is three different very kind of                                 variations of the same red white and                                 blue color scheme same sort of stars and                                 stripes but how we were going to                                 implement that on the final site really                                 came down to the next step in the                                 process and they ended up really picking                                 this style tiled to move forward with                                 again still very similar to what they                                 had for the campaign site but making                                 some some clear choices that pointed                                 towards a greater amount of content the                                 campaign site specifically was pulling                                 feeds in from all over the web it was                                 meant to pull in tweets and smaller                                 snippets of information that would be                                 changed out more often but on the main                                 the main washingtonexaminer.com site it                                 was going to be much more lengthy                                 content so we wanted to put much more of                                 a focus on the typography and the body                                 copy cool so for this project we did                                 something that was similar to the pair                                 wireframing idea in a way but um it was                                 really more sketch session so we got the                                 entire team involved and came together                                 and sort of did a group brainstorm and                                 the way that we set that up was that                                 leading into the meeting everybody was                                 timebox to an hour and they weren't                                 allowed to use any tools like                                 omnigraffle or anything like that they                                 just had to draw a hand drawn sketch and                                 come up with whatever you know crazy                                 idea is that they could possibly come up                                 with because icon this project in                                 particular you know as a Samantha                                 alluded to I mean being really you know                                 cutting edge and modern was really                                 important so we really wanted to push                                 the envelope and get as much input from                                 everybody on the team as possible we                                 also you know feel like this kind of                                 helps alleviate the where do I start                                 feeling you know sometimes when you                                 start doing you actually you're kind of                                 there's initial like inertia where                                 you're like trying to get starting and                                 trying to get inspired and it                                 really kind of breaks that down makes it                                 a lot easier to get rolling I think too                                 with the sketch sessions like we've all                                 were kind of in a room together it was                                 supposed to be an hour meeting it turned                                 into a three-hour meeting and I think a                                 lot of things that we would have never                                 really done before that came out of this                                 project because we we sort of did we                                 kind of forced each other to think                                 differently on this project yeah and you                                 know we also just kind of after we                                 talked to everybody kind of presented                                 their sketches and we talked about you                                 know the elements of each that we liked                                 as a group I believe we ended up                                 scratching all the all the things we                                 done up in to that point and completely                                 redrawing it on the whiteboard together                                 yeah it was really good so then you know                                 getting into wireframes again because                                 you know I think they take part of our                                 friends are similar to this as well like                                 they were there a little bit more high                                 fidelity than a typical wireframe is but                                 I think that really just reflects the                                 level of collaboration that we had with                                 everybody on the team the whole way                                 through so this is what the the                                 wireframe look like for examiner we feel                                 like it's really really important to do                                 fairly heavy annotations of the                                 functionality that's implied in a                                 wireframe regardless of how the level of                                 visual fidelity and detail which baked                                 into it and I believe actually in this                                 upper area you can see it says top story                                 treatment TBD in design phase and I                                 think that that actually was a the                                 result of a conversation we had where we                                 weren't really sure how the visual                                 design was going to affect this layout                                 but just in case we wanted the client to                                 sort of be aware that you know color                                 proximity chunking all these things                                 could affect how that area was laid out                                 so we didn't really want to get to                                 walked into that so early in the game                                 and so if you take a look here that's                                 the final design that ended up going to                                 development so actually another thing                                 that's worth mentioning is one of the                                 things that they asked for us to do is                                 to find ways to work elements of the                                 printed paper into the website design so                                 one of the ways that we did that is you                                 know a lot of times if you look at a                                 newspaper you see that you know they're                                 equivalent of the navigation or the list                                 of sections within that paper is really                                 just kind of de-emphasized you know it's                                 like go to a                                                             tried to carry that through in a design                                 for the site as well and really put the                                 emphasis on you know the really large in                                 your face top stories what's inside                                 actually that came from what they put on                                 the front page of the paper correct yep                                 and we're going to go ahead and scroll                                 down with that ended up kind of looking                                 like because you can see here this is a                                 pretty extensive site this wasn't your                                 average front page of just like a brush                                 or where site this was there's a lot of                                 content going on here there's a lot of                                 different sections that needed to be                                 populated in the front and speaking to                                 that idea that we alluded to earlier                                 about UX for editors on the tape art                                 side that was really important on this                                 project as well so a lot of these areas                                 where you're seeing you know featured                                 content for a particular section editors                                 could just kind of hover over that and                                 edit that you know box or a content                                 module in line and swap out what stories                                 were being featured there so it was a                                 really quick and easy process of                                 assembling all these curated areas so                                 now I think we're going to go into some                                 common themes that we found throughout                                 the two projects that I guess they're                                 kind of like tips tricks that we sort of                                 found as we continued through through                                 the two projects and really working                                 together and I think the one that I                                 really cannot stress enough is design a                                 system not pages um this is really great                                 i mean at drupalcon i think that this is                                 maybe something more understood than at                                 other web conferences because of the way                                 drupal handles content but the reality                                 of the situation is i think a lot of                                 other content management systems and                                 just the way in general we think based                                 on the fact that we've evolved from the                                 print industry where magazines and                                 newspapers have been the common norm no                                 clients think in terms of pages and it's                                 really easy as a designer to think in                                 terms of pages but the extensibility and                                 just the flexibility of Drupal and                                 what you're providing your client                                 especially on a site that handles so                                 much content and so much media you                                 really have to think in terms of a                                 system and so for take part for example                                 we assembled a very loose style guide                                 that kind of gave them the tools to                                 continue using this these styles forward                                 if they decided to build out and change                                 their site over a period of time so yeah                                 just very simple colors hex values what                                 a link would look like and this was                                 probably bout a five-page document that                                 we handed off to them but just a                                 guideline for them to move forward with                                 so it wasn't completely and they weren't                                 completely in the dark about it and then                                 for examiner we really thought a little                                 bit more modularly what we handed over                                 was a system of boxes styles that they                                 could adapt for example our top five                                 could very simply be changed into                                 another another block if they needed to                                 so another challenge that I alluded to                                 earlier you know we were authors so                                 authors aren't necessarily just drupal                                 users or even people they can be an                                 organization or a team of people and                                 this this really differs from project to                                 project so on any publishing site you                                 know you really want to have a lot of                                 conversations about authors and how they                                 need to be modeled from a content                                 structure perspective as well as how                                 they need to be rendered on the page I                                 think you know take part had fairly                                 consistent treatment in structure of                                 authors that they all pretty much look                                 the same regardless of where they showed                                 up but on the examiner site specifically                                 you know certain authors were sort of                                 highlighted you know most of your very                                 prominent bloggers are going to show                                 like a like button or a follow button to                                 follow them on Twitter whereas you know                                 a story that comes through from the                                 associated press or as from an author                                 who maybe they don't have a photo before                                 or whatever there's a slightly different                                 treatment you know in some cases they                                 might want that author to be linked to                                 an author page that lists all the                                 content associated with them in other                                 cases they don't necessarily                                 cross promotion of content now I mean                                 this is a pretty common theme when it                                 gets too when it comes to designing her                                 media because everybody wants you know                                 similar light content to be linked                                 together you want multiple page views                                 not just for the experience the users                                 having but there's also this added kind                                 of business goal of advertising as well                                 so for example here on the examiner                                 scroll down we made sure that there was                                 a close proximity to popular topics and                                 also see near the content of the site we                                 talked a lot about where this content                                 should be but I'm I felt very strongly                                 that it should be in close proximity to                                 what you're actually reading white                                 content should be grouped together and                                 so that's why we really worked in this                                 left-hand column so that you could make                                 sure that while you're reading if                                 there's something else that's important                                 you can you can really see the the                                 connection between the two things in                                 order to continue and then if you scroll                                 down the page at the bottom there was                                 always more from the capital which would                                 be you know a little bit more of a                                 highlighted area take part was a little                                 different and the fact that not only did                                 they have these all related stories that                                 they wanted people to see but they also                                 had these actions and actions really                                 needed to be treated differently one of                                 the things that I think we really wanted                                 to make sure of is that people didn't                                 see an action as being an advertisement                                 we wanted to make sure that people saw                                 as being a related a related thing that                                 kind of was worked into the story I                                 think the first time I really started                                 digging in to take part in what they                                 were about I was a little nervous about                                 this action they wanted me to take part                                 take part in was this something they                                 were trying to coax me to do for you                                 know advertising but it's not it's it's                                 really part of what they're about so                                 making sure that that is worked into the                                 content so again another another big you                                 know common thread is this idea of a                                 life cycle of a topic and I think the                                 example on take part is a really good                                 illustration of this so you know they                                 might start tagging content with                                 something like food and over time you                                 know as they are sort of realigning                                 their editorial focus they decide                                 no food is really important to people                                 you know health people are                                 health-conscious more and more so they                                 start to put a little bit more emphasis                                 on food and they might stand up you know                                 a topic front for that you know                                 particular topic and then we would want                                 to like redirect them from that tag                                 based list so that they always land on                                 this page and then you know once that                                 topic you know builds even more steam                                 they might decide to produce a movie                                 about it and then that's when you know                                 you'll get into that setting up a                                 campaign which is basically like a                                 microsite for that particular topic and                                 it was a really interesting challenge to                                 build a set of tools that really allowed                                 editors to kind of drive this evolution                                 of the content presentation on their own                                 without needing a whole lot of developer                                 involvement to stand up one of these                                 pages                                 so the next topic of commenting isn't                                 necessarily a unique one in any way it's                                 just that we found that with media in                                 particular in commenting is something                                 you're going to have and everybody and                                 in this case both of these clients                                 wanted to handle it a little differently                                 so you can see here on takePart we                                 actually used the Drupal commenting                                 system and you know you can see that it                                 was designed visually to really match                                 with the rest of the the site look and                                 feel but here on Examiner we actually                                 used discuss or Disqus I'm not sure how                                 it's pronounced but I think one of the                                 the fears as a designer when you have                                 this third-party integration as how how                                 unique can I make this third-party                                 plugin and with Disqus we actually                                 reused hype kit on the washington                                 examiner site we were able to implement                                 Typekit throughout all the comments so                                 it's very seamless same color scheme                                 same typography it really doesn't look                                 very much different from the rest of the                                 site so advertising this this is always                                 on a really interesting topic as a                                 designer talk about and especially                                 talking with other designers I have a                                 friend who worked on the post and I                                 asked him about the Washington Post I'm                                 sorry I asked him a little bit about his                                 experiences and he had a very difficult                                 time getting past the fact that                                 advertising just put it was just a                                 damper on everything and I think                                 especially going into the washington                                 examiner I did I can kind of had a                                 little bit of fear in my mind about oh                                 man we have to work all this advertising                                 in but I really tried to embrace the                                 idea of making advertising visually a                                 part of the design very small subtle                                 things to make it less obtrusive for                                 example you can see at the top you have                                 the leaderboard and then there's just                                 the subtle a shadowing that goes around                                 the entire site just sort of chunk it                                 and put like to sort of visually imply                                 that there's like content below the                                 leaderboard and also as you can see                                 there's this Macy's                                 that was in the navigation so going into                                 this project and I mean all projects                                 have requirements that you have to work                                 around and in this particular project                                 the advertising had been sold before we                                 had gone into the design phase so we had                                 to work around specific things I mean                                 one was that there was going to be                                 advertising in the navigation bar it may                                 not be what we ideally want for the user                                 experience but they they make money this                                 is actually a free publication so this                                 is how this is their bread and butter                                 there wouldn't be a site without it so                                 you're trying to really make the the                                 macys add that you see there in the                                 navigation less obtrusive and actually                                 kind of blend in a little bit more with                                 the overall look and feel of the site                                 yeah I mean I think another thing that                                 we're hearing more and more things I've                                 been reading or that you know as much as                                 publishers like to try to cram as many                                 ads above the fold as they possibly can                                 because those are the ones that are the                                 most valuable it actually causes you get                                 a ding from an SEO standpoint no so                                 that's the kind of thing that we spend a                                 lot of time kind of consulting with them                                 about yeah I mean I think as a designer                                 it's really it's really easy to get                                 frustrated and want to push back but I                                 mean part of being a designer is solving                                 problems and there's not always going to                                 be a very an easy road to solving those                                 problems and working around advertising                                 i think is is just a challenge that you                                 have to embrace to some degree and make                                 it work as best as you can even more so                                 now that responsive design is becoming a                                 much bigger thing yes absolutely so that                                 concludes our presentation today on                                 designing for media if you would like                                 this is faced you tack on twitter dave                                 is Dave the save on Twitter and I'm                                 Samantha toy you can feel free to line                                 up and ask some questions here if you'd                                 like or feel free to also paying us on                                 Twitter thanks a lot thank you                                 have you had any issues in selling your                                 process to your clients do I pushed back                                 from your client saying wait a minute                                 here I've already made some mock-ups for                                 you and you don't need to go through all                                 those wireframes and stuff like that                                 yeah it's a really great question I                                 think I mean we do have a standard                                 process but we we have a lot of                                 different tools in our tool belt to be                                 able to adapt to you know the various                                 situations we end up finding ourselves                                 in but i think you know in some cases                                 you know clients will provide their own                                 mock-ups or even their own comps and                                 there's a lot of back and forth that the                                 my team does to kind of make sure that                                 certain things are consistent and we                                 vetted all of the various you know                                 implied relationships between content                                 and all those kinds of things and click                                 pads and all that from the UX standpoint                                 I think to as an organization were very                                 on point about keeping our message clear                                 throughout the sales process throughout                                 the beginning of the engagement process                                 so clients are really aware of our                                 process going into working with us so a                                 lot of times by the time they get to us                                 a sort of already expecting this but I                                 think another piece of the puzzle is                                 that we work very iterative Lee and the                                 advantage to that there's tons of                                 advantages to that but one is that you                                 develop a sense of trust with your                                 client taking small steps that they're                                 very involved in so there is a we go to                                 get a good create sense of trust at a                                 certain point working through the                                 process where they they kind of know                                 what to expect at the next point any                                 other questions I know that your style                                 tile is sort of i think the aim of it is                                 to take a shortcut if you will to the                                 copying process uh-huh so it's a little                                 more targeted and it's a little more on                                 are you able to to reduce the number of                                 cops that you're creating yeah in                                 practice doesn't really work yeah so                                 it's kind of hard because the style                                 tiles process which I talked about today                                 briefly is really its own I could go on                                 for                                                                      often now                                 where there's a site up about it but the                                 idea there is that it's an iterative                                 process again getting the client to                                 trust you and have setting their                                 expectations and I think setting                                 expectations is a really important part                                 of it and especially with the responsive                                 design process I mean the client in                                 reality we're not going to as designers                                 be able to mock up every single comp for                                 every single device every single break                                 point I mean there's just so many things                                 in play here so setting the expectations                                 that we're designing a style that will                                 applaud be applied to systemic elements                                 throughout the process really helps them                                 to understand that so in the situation                                 with the examiner that I mean I'm not                                 going to say it's always going to be                                 this way but examiner was they accepted                                 the comp the first comp no changes take                                  part had changes but they were iterative                                  changes there was never ever a complete                                  redesign so I find that that's time                                  upfront being spent really does make up                                  and and get you ahead and you are                                  presenting one comp yes and your style                                  tile yeah in it Darius we can add it                                  that or whatever but wait depending to                                  on the client and the situation I mean I                                  really hate to cookie cutter any process                                  I feel like kind of having the skeleton                                  that you sort of work around and being                                  very agile around that skeleton for                                  examiner for example the the first comp                                  we did the wire framing process for the                                  home page and the the article page but                                  we actually showed the article pages the                                  first comp yeah the article page is                                  actually way more important to them than                                  the home page yeah yes hi can you talk a                                  little more about how you empowered                                  authors to create those standalone pages                                  and different layouts and the tools and                                  level of effort that took yeah                                  absolutely so i guess i mean the the                                  trickiest one was probably for take part                                  you know with those sort of microsite                                  campaign pages so we used a lot of                                  different tools to do that that                                  basically would allow them we used                                  context for example we also used                                  something called i think it was called a                                  field box so the the campaign content                                  side was you know it had a ton of fields                                  on it and                                  from the old system and we had to                                  migrate that to the new system and                                  create you know a new equivalent of each                                  of them we had a lot of conversations                                  about whether or not that was necessary                                  but you know suffice it to say that even                                  if all of those fields were populated we                                  didn't necessarily want to actually                                  render all of them on the page just                                  because they were stored there so we                                  created some tools that basically like                                  created a layer separation there so that                                  you could place a box onto a page and                                  then choose which fields or which                                  combinations of fields you actually                                  wanted to render in that box and we also                                  you know the simple campaign page was                                  not like a full boa microsite but there                                  was the option to you know sort of make                                  it a microsite which would layer like                                  another context on top of it which the                                  top navigation slimmer and a lot of                                  those other changes that you probably                                  noticed I think another thing from like                                  a visual design standpoint that I've                                  talked a lot with other designers about                                  is this idea of kind of lowering your                                  expectations for how much control you're                                  going to have I mean we're essentially                                  giving control of how a design may look                                  to these content creators I mean with                                  examiner they can to some degree changed                                  layout depending on what they're looking                                  to do with specific campaigns and                                  articles and stuff and so yeah giving                                  them a toolkit yeah exactly like sort of                                  my point about the breadth and depth of                                  coverage like because they were covering                                  all of those different areas you know                                  not every you know landing page for a                                  section looked the same you know some of                                  them if they weren't curating them every                                  day it was just a feed of the latest                                  stories you know other section fronts                                  were really prominent prominently                                  treated curated stories and you know if                                  a section had a blog associated with it                                  we would also promote the blog on the                                  page as well I mean this is one of the                                  strengths of Drupal and I again talked                                  about our designers about this and it's                                  really hard because you know you you                                  want you want everything to look just                                  like the comp you design but the the                                  strength and Drupal is the flexibility                                  that the authors and the content                                  creators can change these things so sort                                  of going into it with that mindset and                                  trying really hard to provide those                                  tools and pieces that they can they can                                  use                                  I um how closely do you tend to involve                                  the your clients project leads in the                                  creative process as far as when you get                                  down to the nitty-gritty of                                  brainstorming and stuff do you tend to                                  keep them more at arm's length until                                  you're ready or you bring them in at the                                  beginning yeah so I mean that's a big                                  part of my process is that we identify                                  the client stakeholders and to some                                  degree I try and involve all the                                  stakeholders as much as possible again                                  to a degree so if it's like I'd say five                                  or less stakeholders ideally three is a                                  great number I think a examiner had five                                  but having everybody sort of on the same                                  page knowing okay this is going to be                                  your role and this is going to be mine                                  and we're going to work very much                                  together on this all of the designs and                                  the style tiles and adjectives those are                                  all things given to me by the client and                                  I'm sort of taking what they're saying                                  acting somewhat like a i call it like                                  being a counselor or a therapist I'm                                  hearing what they're saying and I'm                                  going to reinterpret it in different                                  visuals and I'll give back the visuals                                  and we'll talk through it and there's                                  you know some sense of there's some                                  sense of consultancy there where I'm                                  kind of recommending what should be                                  really good for what they've given me                                  but there really is when it comes down                                  to style and preference I think the the                                  client is involved quite a bit anything                                  else well thank you guys very much I                                  really appreciate it discuss                                  you
