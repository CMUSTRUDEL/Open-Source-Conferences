Title: DrupalCon Denver 2012: IT'S MORE THAN PUSHING OUT DATA
Publication date: 2013-03-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Denver - March 2012
Description: 
	Modern web application design principals are quickly adapting to the prevalence of mobile devices. Users have a need to be able to have a positive experience on the web where they want, when they want, and on any device they happen to be carrying. We're getting good at building applications that can push out data that can be handled by these devices, but the need to collect data from these devices is growing almost as quickly. Personal sensors are becoming commonplace in the devices we use. They include common things like GPS in the cars we use, FitBit to help us track our exercise, or Siri to recognize our voice and assist us with contextual tasks. There exists a need to be able to collect data from these devices and be able to visualize it in a meaningful way. What if you were able to collect the GPS data from every car on the road to help model traffic patterns, or just know that you were going to be late for work? What if your OK Cupid app was able to tell you who to hit on at a bar? Wouldn't it be cool to have a conference ID badge that turned green whenever you passed your favorite module maintainer in the hall so you could ask him or her to review your patch or help you with a problem? (ok, maybe the last one takes it a bit too far) Pulling data from the devices on and around us is a part of developing mobile web applications, but the focus is far too often only on how we present an experience to a user, not how we collect information to enhance that experience. It's important that we take advantage of the lessons we've learned with early augmented reality apps, and use the capabilities that are built into the devices we come in contact with each day to further enrich our experience.

Questions answered by this session: 
What is meant by "personal sensors"? Is that just another term for a cell phone?
What are some of the ways that personal sensor data collection is being done? What are some prospects for the future?
Why is it important to be able to collect and aggregate this data? How will this enrich our experience?
What does this mean for our personal privacy? What are some scary things that could happen?
How have early applications led us to where we are, and what do we need to do to keep advancing?

Strahl                               i work at aquia I'm a project manager                               turned program manager there which is a                               fancy way of saying that I work with                               aqua is big customers on there the big                               things they want to do in Drupal and                               mobile has become a relatively hot topic                                lately inside of the the triple                                enterprise space and I first became                                pretty passionate about this topic in                                                                                                       o'reilly talking about personal sensing                                technology and at the time i had a very                                close friend was really into the idea of                                personal sensors she was the first                                person I Bernie with a Fitbit and since                                I was able to to speak with her and get                                some feedback on this stuff and                                hopefully be able to share some                                interesting knowledge about personal                                sensing with you guys so how many data                                points you collect on a daily basis                                there are some things that are you might                                carry around the collect data for you                                probably most everyone in here has a                                phone it's pretty popular also at                                conferences to take around a pedometer                                just because people like to brag about                                how many steps they take in between                                their sessions you know you guys                                probably also have an ipad some credit                                cards in the wallet maybe you have a                                metro card or a subway card if you live                                in a big city all you probably took air                                planes or buses or taxis to get here                                today and you're probably a member of a                                social network or three these days and                                then you've probably used a mapping                                application and you know Google Maps or                                Bing or something like that from your                                cell phone or maybe from a desktop                                browser in the past week or so all of                                these things are capturing public data                                points about you so all of your search                                histories all of your social network                                interactions all the stuff has been                                captured and you're leaving little                                digital breadcrumbs around                                the internet about your particular                                browsing habits and it happens almost                                unconsciously now we've gotten to the                                point where we don't necessarily even                                really think about the fact that every                                single action we take online and with                                our devices there in our pockets leaves                                a trace of something that we did so lots                                of people thing is mobile spine you know                                there's a lot of very well-known                                capabilities i think that people are                                generally cognizant of most people know                                their phone has camera most people don't                                realize it never really turns off most                                people know that their their cell phone                                has a microphone on it which also                                doesn't ever really turn off most people                                know their phone has the internet but                                they also don't really think about the                                fact that even when they're not actively                                using their phone it's sending messages                                back and forth about what you're doing                                in your habits lots of things about you                                and then lastly there's there's GPS and                                other positioning systems within                                people's phones they're constantly                                collecting data about where you are if                                you're moving if you're stationary you                                know it's pretty easy to for a GPS to                                tell if you've just gone on an elevator                                because it will have an elevation point                                for you at the beginning it'll go dark                                for                                                              elevator and then pick up your elevation                                point again at the end um there are also                                some other not so well-known                                capabilities that the mobile devices                                have so also on on that cell phone of                                yours you have an accelerometer and                                accelerometer works just like a                                pedometer it's going to tell exactly how                                many steps you're taking it's going to                                know things about your breathing habits                                um things about you know you when you're                                sleeping all these other sorts of things                                that that accelerometers combined with                                microphone technology can pick up and                                learn about us most of them have                                thermometers now there's not a ton of                                 mobile weather stations stuff out there                                 yet but that's one of the big ideas                                 behind mobile devices is this idea that                                 we would we would be able to have                                 temperature information about you know                                 how warm how cold we are or any sort of                                 other whether based information about                                 the environment that we're in for the                                 more you have a clock it's pretty basic                                 but the clock is really key to all this                                 because your phone is a                                 to keep track of the length of time that                                 you're doing certain things and that's                                 very important for understanding the                                 action that you're taking it at that                                 given moment and the compass aspect of                                 it and that's pretty self-explanatory                                 but one thing that has been coming up in                                 mobile device land lately is the ability                                 to monitor the power output of your                                 phone so at any given time you have a                                 bunch of different applications that are                                 running on your phone and I ha was just                                 reading an article on rewrite web the                                 other day about how all of those mobile                                 applications that we all use that are                                 free to download they're constantly                                 sending data back and forth across the                                 internet and that's draining the                                 batteries from our phones and you're                                 actually able to profile the power usage                                 and power consumption on your phone and                                 understand what mobile apps you're                                 running so any application that has                                 access to monitor the battery life of                                 your phone can also know all the other                                 apps they're running on so the point of                                 this is all our phones know more about                                 us than we think even the most                                 technically savvy among us have probably                                 heard one thing that was surprising that                                 tirade about mobile devices but there's                                 there's more to it than that there's                                 also digital fingerprints that we leave                                 in in other ways we've lots of                                 application data about us and all of us                                 use mobile apps most of us use computers                                 iPads that sort of thing those all                                 through their applications or also                                 collect information about our habits                                 there's also things that we like to                                 refer as proximal data proximal data is                                 data of the people next to you um it                                 does not necessarily matter so much if                                 you forgot your cell phone today but if                                 someone else notices that you're here                                 and tags you or talks about you or                                 checks you in or you know whatever else                                 what name your you know Foursquare                                 facebook like application of choice via                                 proximal data we can also understand a                                 lot about you usually proximal data is                                 used to collaborate primary data so data                                 that you're presenting but oftentimes                                 proximal data can be used in place of                                 primary data and then lastly you have                                 environmental data so there's there's                                 lots of environmental sensor                                 it's talks not really about these things                                 but it's important to know that every                                 time you swipe your credit card most the                                 time when you're in taxi cab your get                                 photographed or you leave little digital                                 fingerprints around via your your wallet                                 and the transactions that happen in your                                 wallet so this is all pretty cool                                 actually I mean we entered with                                 tricorders I don't know how growing up                                 is a little kid watching Star Trek with                                 my dad when I was like                                                 that uh that I saw Spock with that                                 tricorder and I have one of those in my                                 pocket that is so cool um the thing that                                 I think that uh we always thought about                                 for mobile devices we always thought                                 about mobile devices delivering us                                 information we want to know more things                                 about the world around us but it's kind                                 of flip flopped um these devices now                                 instead of telling us a lot of data                                 which they do do they're actually used                                 to gather a tremendous amount of                                 information about us and i'm not sure if                                 we ever really thought about it that way                                 and until recently and we can gain a lot                                 of insights into human behavior so one                                 of the big shifts in that mentality has                                 been from this idea of active                                 participation versus passive                                 participation so when you're talking                                 about actively sharing something you're                                 making a conscious effort to log on to                                 facebook and to type something in or to                                 check in or any of those other things                                 that require an action from you to                                 actually do but now there's a whole lot                                 of passive communication that's                                 happening when all of us you know                                 download an app from the itunes store                                 you know we all we all look at that                                 license agreement for about a quarter of                                 a second before hit accept and we just                                 gave away all of our data that could be                                 captured by that program so once you opt                                 in you're constantly passively monitored                                 until you opt out again and the point of                                 that is is now that there is is data                                 being collected about you even when                                 you're not consciously providing that                                 data it gives us a lot more information                                 to work with so one of the things that I                                 don't want to dive too deeply into here                                 but it's definitely we're                                 mentioning is this is scary for a lot of                                 people because people think about the                                 idea of privacy especially people that                                 have things in their private lives or                                 controversial figures or whatnot that                                 they don't necessarily want those things                                 to be public privacy is a huge concern                                 and we have yet to solve it there's a                                 lot of bills going on in the European                                 Union right now around privacy and                                 ownership and personal data the United                                 States is also considering similar                                 things with the Obama administration so                                 there is a there's a whole lot to do                                 here and this is kind of the bike shed                                 of this talk is I don't want to dive too                                 deeply into privacy implications I'm                                 sure it'll come up and if any of you                                 have questions about it I understand at                                 least a little bit about it but I really                                 want to try to focus on something                                 different and and what that is is I want                                 to look at how this data can be used                                 within society to collect information                                 about all of us not any one of us so                                 looking at some early adopters of this                                 um I don't know if you guys have heard                                 of a us on allahi he was targeted by the                                 United States government as a watchlist                                 candidate not that long after September                                                                                                       world and it just got back to the United                                 States and was detained by the FBI for                                 for some time and he's an artist he                                 travels around and does art                                 installations and what Hassan found out                                 is that you know he was always in the                                 system from this point on and he was                                 questioned on a weekly or a monthly                                 basis about his activities and so rather                                 than wait for the FBI to come to him he                                 started going to the FBI he got the card                                 from from one of his agent handlers and                                 said you know what I'm just gonna let                                 you know where I'm at and this turned                                 into something over time I Hassan had                                 been doing this for a couple of years                                 where he would send you know oh hey i'm                                 going to senegal and by the way here's a                                 picture of me with you know a tiger or                                 something like that I don't know a pony                                 but he would start sending the FBI                                 agents his vacation photos                                 and soon it became a lot more than that                                 they were sharing all sorts of personal                                 anecdotes and all sorts of other things                                 and then his FBI handler left and so it                                 was back to that same routine of you                                 know get called in every couple of weeks                                 to go get questioned by the FBI and so                                 what he decided to do is you decide to                                 turn into an art project and he he set                                 up a website which you can view right                                 there and it's literally his entire life                                 where he is at every moment I think it                                 even has the phone calls he makes um                                 it's it's literally everything about                                 that guy in a timeline and over the                                 years he's amassed hundreds of thousands                                 of photos data points everything about                                 his life is tracked on the Internet um                                 another person that that is kind of                                 inspirational in this is a guy from                                 Microsoft by name of Gordon Bell and                                 what Gordon Bell did and this was                                 actually largely controversial at the                                 time is a when he became an executive at                                 Microsoft he started hanging around a                                 portable camera around his neck and he                                 took pictures of everyone he met with                                 everyday mundane objects like the food                                 he eats every single thing every time he                                 interacts with a piece of technology                                 he's filming what he's doing and he's                                 masked what is considered to be probably                                 the largest online repository of                                 computing and technology in existence                                 it's almost like a museum of technology                                 through this guy's eyes over many many                                 years um it's one of those interesting                                 projects to browse I highly recommend I                                 know most of you don't like to type in                                 microsoft com donate but uh I highly                                 recommend looking at that site because                                 it's a really really fascinating look at                                 technology so these guys were at the                                 forefront of understanding what mobile                                 sensing really meant and well like I                                 said I don't want to focus too much on                                 individuals I think that it's important                                 to realize that these guys are pioneers                                 in a way of understanding this whole                                 idea of mobile interaction and personal                                 sensing so this gets back to what the                                 the meat and potatoes of the talk is if                                 you will populations of people are                                 always more interesting than individuals                                 the yes there's privacy                                 concerns associated with individuals yes                                 there's individual people that we can                                 look to to try to understand this space                                 but really it's about understanding us                                 as people in a population you know                                 there's there's a lot of different sizes                                 of population you can talk about but                                 really we want to look at insights into                                 us as humans and to really understand                                 our own behavior so i'm going to show                                 you guys some examples here in just a                                 second so one of my favorite sayings is                                 a population a statistical population is                                 not just a collection of anecdotal                                 points you have to define a population                                 by a measurable group of people that                                 have common characteristics and that                                 population data should then be able to                                 be sliced and diced based on those                                 characteristics finally the the size of                                 the population is not really relevant I                                 mean you can have a population of this                                 room we're all at drupalcon we're all                                 attending this session so we can be                                 considered as statistical population you                                 probably get some interesting stuff from                                 us about our mobile sensors right now                                 but it doesn't necessarily matter if                                 we're talking about all you know however                                 many billion people are on the planet or                                 if we're just talking about the people                                 here so one of those interesting ways of                                 gathering a true population of mobile                                 sensing devices is this project right                                 here is a sponsored by Nokia and still                                 ascend data collection campaign what                                 Nokia did is they said well it's a it's                                 really hard for us to get people to opt                                 in to having their mobile devices                                 monitored by us moreover we don't really                                 have an app to sell that provides a                                 tremendous amount of value so we're just                                 going to give                                                          for free for life and the caveat of that                                 is we have to be able to collect every                                 bit of data about those people and so it                                 started in                                                       operating since then with these two                                 hundred individuals that live in                                 Switzerland and they're literally                                 tracking everything about their habits                                 at all time and they've got in a                                 tremendous amount of research published                                 around the human                                 havior habits of all these people and                                 they're not looking at any one                                 individual they're looking at the                                 collective habits how they interact with                                 each other how their friendships work                                 like what creates interest among people                                 that will allow them to actually stop                                 and talk to other people and these                                 phones are incredible because they have                                 Bluetooth sensing technology they have                                 the internet they have GPS all the bells                                 and whistles that smartphones have but                                 they also whenever two people that are a                                 part of the project come close to one                                 another they shared data and that really                                 enables a really interesting thing                                 because it creates not just this idea of                                 Nokia watching over all these people but                                 it creates this network of sharing                                 between all these people so they can all                                 learn about each other and one of the                                 big research projects was understanding                                 the relationships that they created via                                 this project and I really encourage you                                 guys I got a link to this up in the                                 upper right corner it's kind of hard to                                 read I encourage you guys to go look at                                 the research of these guys have done                                 because it's really brilliant and                                 amazing stuff so let's think about the                                 size of this data for a second zenga is                                 you know a popular casual gaming company                                 that has like six of the top ten                                 facebook games and you know i'm sure                                 everybody's at least seen words with                                 friends if not played it themselves if                                 you look at how many people use xanga                                                                                                          of them something like eighty percent of                                 them connect via their mobile devices um                                 at that rate that is so much larger than                                 all of those other things like we're                                 talking about you know a way bigger than                                 the entirety of Xbox Live way bigger                                 than all of World of Warcraft way bigger                                 than all of these things that we                                 consider to be really big technology                                 platforms and because the power of                                 casual gaming reaches out to us and                                 provides us with this little bit of                                 entertainment we're willing to give                                 xanga everything about ourselves in                                 order to play games furthermore if you                                 look at facebook facebook as of you know                                 december i think claimed                                             monthly users and of those about sixty                                 percent connected via a mobile                                 application that's not using your mobile                                 device to go to facebook com that's                                 actually using facebook mobile app                                 that is really tremendous that sixty                                 percent of people are using Facebook via                                 an app so looking at the population                                 there you have hundreds if not thousands                                 of data points that are collected about                                 people that use those two applications                                 and they do it willingly and freely and                                 almost without thought if any of you I'm                                 sure some of you guys use both Facebook                                 and a xanga game there are literally                                 thousands of data points about you                                 because of your use of those                                 applications but what is really                                 interesting is that you're able to                                 cross-reference all of these between                                 associates so you know you play words                                 with friends against other people you                                 also have other sensors so Facebook for                                 example is able to tap into a lot of                                 hardware features of your phone around                                 location and non-personal sensors so                                 when you report that you're a drupalcon                                 that is in and of itself a data point                                 even though it's not directly related to                                 the device that you're working on and                                 then there's also loads of information                                 that is unrelated to that application                                 that is collected I know that that my                                 phone collects information about my                                 music habits and that is often shared on                                 Facebook if I'm playing Spotify on my                                 phone so every Spotify song I listen to                                 on my cell phone gets linked back to                                 Facebook and other people get to look at                                 what I'm looking at all of those things                                 are again these little digital                                 breadcrumbs and we leave about our                                 behavior in habits so seriously think                                 about the amount of data that we're                                 talking about here we're talking about                                 hundreds of millions of people                                 collecting thousands of data points                                 every month that is a tremendous                                 information repository just in two                                 applications that is could providing an                                 incredible insight into our human lives                                 and our behavior and again not only one                                 person's behavior but think about the                                 ability to track things like the spread                                 of a disease because people are posting                                 about it on Facebook tracking political                                 trends tracking any of these other                                 things that you could look at by looking                                 at you know a billion points of data                                 about human beings                                 and these are some of the types of                                 questions that you could ask a data set                                 like that where were people when they                                 were playing words with friends were                                 they sitting on the toilet were they you                                 know riding a bicycle I would be really                                 hard hopefully they weren't driving you                                 know how long did they use them what was                                 the length of time that people                                 interacted with these sorts of things                                 and what does that mean about our                                 behavior you know are you are you trying                                 to close down Facebook real quick while                                 you're at work because your boss might                                 be looking over your shoulder and then                                 what actions did you take and that's                                 really where the key is is understanding                                 the actions um so again just sort of                                 rearrange I just said you're probably                                 bored if you're playing zenga or you're                                 listening to me present at rubicon but                                 anyway the idea is is that you're able                                 to model pieces of human behavior based                                 on our use of these applications so this                                 does a lot of interesting things the                                 implications for health care huge if any                                 of you have a Fitbit you guys can no                                 relative to other people that have                                 fitbit's what your exercise level is we                                 could also like I said track the spread                                 of contagions zombie outbreaks for                                 example there's a lot going on in                                 protest spaced about this i mean the                                 protester was a big topic this year                                 there this past year rather and in                                 protest you're seeing applications like                                 you shaheedi and other push based data                                 applications out there that are really                                 aggregating a lot of information about                                 protesters and it's on both sides you                                 also saw a lot of things with a not                                 necessarily protest related stuff but                                 natural disasters the earthquake in                                 Haiti is a great example of that because                                 of our ability to collect information                                 about mobile data we a through shaheedi                                 people were able to see which roads were                                 open where security centers were where                                 hospitals were still open all based on                                 the aggregation of this mobile data and                                 then other things where it could be                                 interesting is I mentioned the mobile                                 weather stations earlier but the cartel                                 project from MIT is all about collecting                                 information                                 the speed at which you're traveling                                 based on the GPS and your cell phone and                                 if you're in your car it'll know you're                                 in your car and it'll be able to figure                                 out where traffic is blocked and you                                 know any of you that that have been in                                 Boston and driven you know any of the                                 highways in the middle of town can                                 understand why the folks at MIT would be                                 interested in something like that aqua                                 is based in Boston and sometimes takes                                 you know                                                                 from downtown so those sorts of things                                 allow us to have an unprecedented window                                 into all the different facets of our                                 lives that could benefit from                                 understanding more about how other                                 people are experiencing the same thing                                 so here's a few projects i wanted to                                 point you guys too i mentioned the LDC                                 see earlier on a previous slide but                                 there it is again the open geocode or                                 project is really fascinating it's a                                 mobile device app for mapping where it                                 takes matt points and tracks your your                                 GPS coordinates and provides sort of a                                 quasi open layer like overlay where you                                 can present hey I want to know for                                 example I live in Portland Oregon I want                                 to know that I'm walking around in the                                 Pearl neighborhood in portland oregon                                 and so that open open geocode allows you                                 to say i'm in portland i know that by my                                 gps coordinates other people have tagged                                 where I am standing as the pearl so I am                                 actually in the pearl open sense which                                 is a interesting project not to be                                 confused with HTC's opening of their                                 sense UI that's different open sense is                                 all about again a mapping application                                 around personal data and sensor data                                 it's probably the most developed API                                 I've seen around being able to collect                                 sensor information so any of you that                                 are more than side of things i really                                 encourage checking that out there                                 actually some companies they're starting                                 to do some really interesting things                                 based on the open sense ideas and then i                                 mentioned cartel the the folks at MIT                                 monitoring traffic patterns so                                 eventually this all has to come back to                                 triple right we are at drupalcon                                 as much as I love to sit and talk about                                 mobile sensing technology there is                                 really a point to all of this you know                                 the important thing in Drupal is Drupal                                 is really known well for its data model                                 and there should be ways for us to look                                 at this mobile sensing information and                                 be able to aggregate that data and store                                 it in Drupal maybe not to the multi                                 hundred billion data point model but                                 being able to store aggregate data that                                 has been pre mind or pre-filtered and                                 then visualize that data so Drupal on                                 the the end of this can work in mobile                                 applications as that content store as                                 the collection of the mobile data and as                                 the visualization of that data and                                 that's a really powerful combination and                                 I think that there is a lot of                                 interesting stuff to be done in Drupal                                 around these projects and you can see                                 one of them their maps at ed gov has a                                 broadband penetration map but is a                                 visualization of broadband data now they                                 don't store their data in Drupal the map                                 is pre-rendered except you can still                                 browse it and see it in a way that is                                 really interesting using Drupal so those                                 are some ways that we as a community can                                 look at how we can interact with this                                 this new idea of mobile sensing                                 technology and hopefully jump on top of                                 it and do some really interesting things                                 so that's it if anybody has any                                 questions would be happy to take them                                 they said to go up to the microphone if                                 if you had a question or if you are too                                 shy you can shout out at me and I'll                                 repeat it for you                                 responsive design has been a big topic                                 where you're trying to you know using                                 the device to assume in the context of                                 what someone's doing and then you change                                 the website to suit that context if you                                 can you envision some ways where you've                                 got like you know the context of I'm in                                 our grade because the sensors go be able                                 like could you use extend that into                                 something like serving different content                                 so the question is let me see if this                                 works in the ideas of responsive design                                 we want to be able to create better UX                                 via responsive design for mobile devices                                 is there any way to tap into personal                                 sensing technology to enable that to                                 happen is that a fair statement so the                                 idea behind responsive design we don't                                 get to know a lot in the web app space                                 yet about devices but it's coming in                                 right now we get sometimes things like                                 orientation so a website will change                                 when you turn on ipad sideways we get                                 geo-located data often but there's not                                 really you know access to the                                 thermometer or something like that on                                 your on your cell phone I think that                                 html                                                                     to happen where we're figuring out how                                 to get at the sensing portion of the                                 device easier and in terms of the                                 responsive design idea I think that it                                 especially related to aggregate                                 populations it would be interesting to                                 be able to do ad hoc mobile usability                                 testing over a population of people so                                 you have a mobile website that is out                                 there and via some sort of data                                 collection system on a sensor you're                                 able to see how people are using that                                 site when they're using that site and                                 and understand when people want to visit                                 your site and how they're using it when                                 they're there on a mobile device and                                 what's working what is it I think that's                                 where this is really enabling that sort                                 of thing I mean the responsive idea has                                 a lot and I'm not really as burst on how                                 that might interact with sensing                                 technology other than some of the stuff                                 we get an html                                            um for lake on all these data points is                                 there anyone that's really processing                                 the this vast amount of information like                                 like on a broad scale like say the                                 entire verizon network or something like                                 that well verizon is probably doing it                                 you know one of the one of the good ones                                 that I should have mentioned but I                                 didn't twitter is archiving all of its                                 tweets in the National Archive and so                                 that right there is a vast amount of                                 people's public opinion and I means                                 probably a lot of like snooki references                                 and cat pictures but at the same time                                 like there's probably valuable things                                 about election data and about you know                                 Arab Spring a lot of that happened on                                 Twitter a lot of the organization of                                 that and so that data is out there and                                 the US government is using it through a                                 lot of open data projects and then                                 moreover twitter is using it to to                                 continue to have a basis of                                 understanding public opinion you also                                 see a lot of things in like the ratings                                 folks the the people that do like the                                 Nielsen ratings and all that sort of                                 stuff where you know you'll look at at                                 policy perceptions so a lot of                                 perception sensing across these big                                 amounts of data but a lot of it is                                 really hold up right now in an                                 individual company and a lot of it is                                 like you know the guys that own the apps                                 right so zenga probably has a tremendous                                 amount of data about everybody plays                                 words with friends or scrabble or with                                 scramble that scrambles the new Wonder                                 and then you also have places like                                 Google where Google has a tremendous                                 amount of data house within it and it                                 allows us to window into some of it but                                 not all of it because they see that data                                 as as their leverage and what they're                                 selling all right cool great                                 presentation thank you thanks for Drupal                                 today what is the best tools to start                                 aggregating and capturing this data on                                 our sites right now so um again I                                 mentioned html                                                     capture especially like geo-located data                                 a lot of it has to do with integrations                                 so using things like services and feeds                                 and pulling in data from other areas and                                 then like I said I mean Drupal can scale                                 pretty well but having billions of data                                 points is pretty tough to just all fit                                 in anything more than a table and so I                                 think that we're triple is going to                                 really shine is if you're able to have                                 some sort of of mobile data aggregation                                 service and then pulling that aggregated                                 data into visualizations that's where it                                 becomes really interesting for Drupal                                 right because now all of a sudden I can                                 see traffic patterns from the cartel                                 system over lay it on a local map and I                                 know that that's kind of been done but                                 there are a lot of interesting things                                 especially in the the disaster recovery                                 and relief space restore the Gulf is a                                 great example of that where they're                                 using a lot of open layer stuff to                                 visualize the impact of the whole                                 Deepwater Horizon thing so that's where                                 drupal really shines right now is not                                 necessarily in the the collection of                                 that data but really in the aggregation                                 and visualization of it okay thank you I                                 guess this is sort of along the same                                 lines of like implementation like with                                 drupal's back and being by default my                                 sequel do you think that would need to                                 switch that out for another database                                 system to take full advantage or are you                                 just using this as purely visualization                                 well you can do that so I mean we have                                 the ability to have a different database                                 in the back end of Drupal and so you                                 know you might store your visualizations                                 in because you don't want to build                                 the visualization every time you might                                 want to have I don't know sees another                                 dirty word Oracle as the the main store                                 for all of these data points and then                                 interface with that I mean all of those                                 things are capable in Drupal which is                                 great and again that speaks the                                 integration side of things too right I                                 mean if we ever really need to have that                                 massive data capture somewhere it's very                                 easy to integrate Drupal into that data                                 system and and use the                                 the tools available to us to collect                                 that data and then visualize it                                 yeah there's there so the question was                                 about the the nokia funded research                                 project in switzerland and gentlemen was                                 asking if there's any known effects to                                 their behavior based upon the research                                 that's being being performed with that                                 population yes absolutely there is it's                                 one of the things that they tout as an                                 interesting result of the project that                                 people's ability to identify others that                                 are in this same program has actually                                 led to more interconnectedness between                                 members then would it existed normally                                 and it goes on to explain a lot about                                 that in a lot of very in-depth research                                 II organizational behavior sort of ways                                 but uh the interesting part is the                                 ability for people to connect better                                 between themselves and to understand                                 more about common and shared interests                                 that the research is there on the site                                 you can actually read the paper it's                                 really good really fascinating anybody                                 else                                 that's actually                                 that's a fascinating question actually                                 so the question is you know what about                                 the idea of using Drupal to facilitate                                 an understanding of the data that we're                                 collecting and trying to build tools                                 that more than just visualization                                 collect perception of the data itself                                 and I think that that is a really                                 interesting space for triple because we                                 have great community features because we                                 have collaborative environment because                                 we are an open source project and we're                                 built by a lot of different people                                 understanding perceptions and attitudes                                 like that I think that that would be a                                 really interesting way to explore how we                                 could do this in gerbil and how it can                                 really make something interesting so you                                 talked a lot about the sensors and the                                 data that you collect from cell phones                                 but I just wanted to mention something                                 that I had actually been involved in a                                 little bit which is other kinds of                                 sensor mobile sensor collection through                                 devices that you actually want to carry                                 specifically for that purpose so the                                 fitbit's kind of like that but more on                                 the open source side of the ecology                                 there's a website called pack tube p ACH                                 tube                                                                 sensor data from any kind of device that                                 you can attach to the web basically so a                                 lot of people are using small hardware                                 devices like arduino xand things like                                 that and sensors in their gardens on                                 their rooftops and and that they carry                                 around with them are putting cars and                                 building sort of virtual networks of                                 people collecting similar kinds of                                 information and then displaying it                                 through pack tube which is also an open                                 source project so something else to look                                 into so with pack tube wasn't that the                                 the one where the grant proposal went                                 out to do mobile weather stations and it                                 was with the US government where we were                                 talking about aggregate collection of                                 mobile weather information based on                                 individuals that was the genesis of the                                 project and it since expanded to                                 basically collecting any kind of sensor                                 information about anything and you can                                 sort of generate your own pack to                                 profile and then say I'm going to be                                 collecting data about soil moisture and                                 temperature in the                                 big Northwest or something yeah yeah so                                 I went to Washington State University                                 where we care a lot about farmland                                 because that's all that's really there                                 and so we had a lot of this this pact                                 tube stuff with a soil moisture and rain                                 fall because the water table in pullman                                 is really really high and we have a lot                                 of artesian wells and stuff like that                                 and people wanted to be able to forecast                                 like crop planting stuff based on soil                                 moisture and it was all this whole                                 mobile sensor idea not related to a                                 person but you'd weatherize one of those                                 things and stick it out in a field one                                 of the one of the things that I like                                 most about that model of doing it is                                 that the data that they collect is open                                 so if you wanted to build a Drupal site                                 to do analysis and aggregation of a                                 specific sort of topic you could go out                                 and find other people who are storing                                 data points on pack tube and bring that                                 data into a Drupal site for analysis or                                 or representation somehow so yeah thanks                                 for ringing that up that's a great point                                 anyone else thanks a lot for listening                                 me guys appreciate it                                 you
