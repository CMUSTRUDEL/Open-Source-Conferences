kind of coordinates the community when

00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:13,250

essentially our internal client for our

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,190
drupalcon website so she makes sure that

00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:20,599
those websites are up and running and

00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,239
have the content we need and the

00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:26,780
features that we're looking for so she's

00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:29,269
our liaison to the tech team and this is

00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,060
Tina Kraus who may be new to you Tina is

00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:35,060
kind of a behind-the-scenes a wizard for

00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:37,579
us she runs our triple con registration

00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,169
and customer service so for instance if

00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:41,389
you're submitting contact us forms and

00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:42,829
you're looking for help either with

00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:45,079
finding information about your ticket or

00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:47,239
what comes with that if you have visa

00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:49,700
letter requests she's the one that

00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:52,489
issues those visa letters and she's also

00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,959
a great project coordinator she helps us

00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:56,239
make sure that we have you know con

00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,099

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,299
guide and does a lot of things behind

00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:05,900
the scenes so that is Tina and this is

00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:07,760
Tim con scene we called Tiquan he I

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,190
forgot to update the bottom line but he

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,049
works with our sponsors so Tim is our

00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,569
sponsorship fulfillment coordinator so

00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:16,549
when sponsors sign up to be a sponsor

00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:18,109
for drupalcon they get a host of

00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:19,729
benefits and Tim works with them to make

00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:20,810
sure that they get all those benefits

00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:23,030
and that they get the most out of those

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,919
benefits so he works with the sales team

00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,730
although he's not a salesperson he just

00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:28,860
helps make sure that

00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,750
the people who sign up get what they

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,070
want and find ways to kind of engage

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,980
with the community if that's something

00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:37,350
that's new to them and this is Lili

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,720
Carver she is our content writer at the

00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,070
drupal association so she if you've

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,020
received for instance like the triple

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,480
association newsletter or she's done

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,430
some amazing community spotlights she

00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,930
does a great job of highlighting what

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,970
what the drupal association is doing but

00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,220
also what the community is doing and for

00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,830
drupalcon Asia she's working a lot with

00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,420
our con communications and helping

00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,150
coordinate our marketing efforts and and

00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:02,100
being that point person for community

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,510
volunteers who want to help with social

00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,020
media and marketing and kind of getting

00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:10,140
the word out all right so jumping into

00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:12,120
the goals for drupalcon Asia so there

00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,740
were when Megan and I were on our site

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,300
visit we realized that they're just a

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,860
host of things that we could do with

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,870
drupalcon Asia but we kind of needed to

00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,760
focus in on on what the things were that

00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,970
we could realistically do with our with

00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,290
our staff and our budget and what we

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,760
were really trying to accomplish with

00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,170
with this event so the first thing

00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,820
obviously is uniting the Indian

00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:33,150
community and connecting that community

00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,800
with the world so um one of our main or

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,420
well two of our main goals for Drupal

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,330
konser to grow the community and to

00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,650
strengthen the community and obviously

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,180
by holding the Khan here we think that

00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,950
this will be a great way to strengthen

00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,050
the community both as far as like local

00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:48,780
leadership but also growing peoples on

00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,340
Drupal skills and it's a great way for

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,900
us to share knowledge and partnerships

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,360
across borders we've heard from quite a

00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,490
few people that they are beyond excited

00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,120
about coming to India for this drupalcon

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:01,770
from all over the world another primary

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,570
goal for Drupal cons in general which

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,670
definitely applies for this drupalcon is

00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:08,130
to accelerate the project and so that

00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:11,550
primarily takes the format of sprinting

00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:13,890
and India already has proven that they

00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,930
are excellent contributors to Drupal and

00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,510
so we are very excited to see what comes

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,520
out of the sprints at Triple Crown Asia

00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:22,380
we also would like to grow the developer

00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,210
talent pool on skill level so we

00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,860
definitely want to help get the word out

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,000
about Drupal but in this case we're

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,400
really talking about growing the

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,650
developer themselves their talent rather

00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,330
than trying to recruit a lot of new

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,710
developers to Drupal although we hope

00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,900
that that's a wonderful byproduct of

00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,700
having this event we also want to

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,900
connect the talent with the employers so

00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,610
one of the things we definitely heard

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,789
what we were there

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:46,819
that they're the employers are hungry

00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:49,879
for more Drupal talent and technology is

00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:50,870
a very there's it's a very open field in

00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:52,099
India there's a lot of things that

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,990
people can choose from so we want to

00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:58,370
make sure that people choose triple and

00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:59,539
connect with the right employers from a

00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,490
planning standpoint we're kind of

00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:03,229
anticipating about eighty percent of the

00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,599
community eighty percent of the

00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:09,490
attendees being domestic from India and

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:12,259
about twenty percent from out of country

00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,090
we believe that the breakdown will

00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:16,039
follow somewhat what we shown there

00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,689
seventy percent developer twenty percent

00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:20,389
site builder and then five percent and

00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:22,879
the c-suite shops and then hopefully

00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:25,219
five percent evaluating Drupal the one

00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,259
thing that we had to decide primarily

00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:30,259
from a budgetary standpoint as we can't

00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:32,419
easily cater to students um we

00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:34,669
financially just can't afford to offer a

00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:37,219
free or deeply discounted ticket for the

00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:39,199
for this triple con and we don't really

00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:41,000
have the space capacity to offer like a

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,439
job fair or an introduction to Drupal

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,690
outside of the training that will we

00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:46,129
will be offering on Thursday now this

00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,360
isn't to say that we don't want the

00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:49,520
students to attend and we don't want

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,779
them to to be invited to attend but

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,400
that's just that's an opportunity for

00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:54,800
the community kind of stuff up that

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,529
outreach and we've heard talk of people

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,849
wanting to maybe kind of subsidize the

00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:00,560
tickets for students as a way to

00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:02,060
introduce them to Drupal so that's a

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,669
really great opportunity for the

00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:07,129
community or their employers to get that

00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:08,990
next wave of Drupal talent engaged and

00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:11,240
seeing what how just how cool the Drupal

00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:13,460
community is so one of the other things

00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,560
we're not specifically catering to is

00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,180
the CMS decision makers potential

00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,949
customers we don't we don't have the

00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,930
capacity to just do a ton of outreach to

00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:22,400
try and recruit them to the event but we

00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,569
are more than encouraging of the

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,389
community to try and recruit those

00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:28,219
people to this event so we're willing to

00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:30,139
help support that however we can but we

00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:34,399
we just can't focus on that as a primary

00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:37,159
goal for us and we're also not tailoring

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,510
the programming of the con to specific

00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:41,599
groups so we're not focusing exclusively

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:44,089
on government or higher ed on you know

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,829
business or nonprofits although there

00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:47,360
will be some specific programming for

00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:50,920
that on Thursday with some of the

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,920
summits that we're going to be offering

00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,670
so some of the key people and players

00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:57,930
that we've been working with to date

00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,399
obviously we have a host of local

00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,740
volunteers who've been involved we got

00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,240
to meet a lot of really great Drupal

00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,430
community leaders while we were there in

00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,040
the site visit and so some of them have

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,379
continued to be involved and have been

00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,649
extremely helpful we will be working

00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:15,300
with an event planning firm called lexia

00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:17,069
they are helping us coordinate some of

00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,290
the production details as far as

00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:22,589
actually executing an event in India and

00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:25,110
then obviously we've been working really

00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:27,629
hand-in-hand with iit who will be our

00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:30,110
physical host our space host for the

00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:30,110
event

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:36,200
so here's a quick snapshot of what the

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:39,440
drupalcon excuse me what the drupalcon

00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,149
schedule is truthfully behind the scenes

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,920
we are working on finalizing a

00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:46,550
memorandum of understanding that will

00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,529
then allow us to essentially open up

00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:50,540
registration and formalize our payment

00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:53,959
gateways so once that's in place we will

00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:55,910
have a lot more a lot more deadlines

00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:57,440
that we can share so more on how we

00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,850
manage the project and when deadlines

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,200
would be for you know the end of

00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,720
sponsorship sales and things like that

00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,700
but this is on the website now and this

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,279
kind of gives you a high-level overview

00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,290
of the timing as far as you know when

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,350
sessions open and sessions close when

00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:15,589
ticketing price changes happen and on

00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:18,399
the right hand side you can see our as

00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:21,260
of now our plan for ticket prices

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:24,920
because we're a us-based company we do

00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:27,380
our budget in u.s. dollars although we

00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,270
will be selling tickets in rupees so as

00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:32,720
of now this is what the plan is as far

00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:34,730
as the rupee's conversion and then also

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,380
there at this point this is the text

00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,029
that we're estimating on top of that

00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,380
that's one of the things that we're

00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:41,360
finalizing in the Memorandum of

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,500
Understanding so once that's finalized

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,180
then we'll be able to publish those

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,430
ticket prices and confirm those but

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:51,680
that's about the range where they will

00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:54,290
be so this is our program plan for

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,959
drupalcon Asia if you've been do another

00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:59,240
drupalcon in Europe or North America you

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,730
know that they often span sometimes up

00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,730
to nine days we're doing a bit of an

00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:07,130
abridged program so on Wednesday we will

00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,720
be doing some set up and will open

00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,490
registration so if people want to come

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,740
and pick up their badges they are

00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,899
welcome to do that Thursday really the

00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,450
the pre-programming starts so we will

00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:18,980
have a business summit and two other

00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,510
summits that we that are yet to be

00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,240
determined and we are also going to be

00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:25,310
offering for trainings one of them will

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,700
be a free beginner training more of like

00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:31,100
the introduction to Drupal type of type

00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,649
of programming and then friday and

00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,390
saturday will really be our traditional

00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:39,110
con programming where there will be

00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:41,480
keynotes and sessions and box which are

00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:42,889
kind of conversational or topic rooms

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,279
and we will also have a sprint

00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:48,139
contribution lounge and then on Sunday

00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:50,990
we are really excited that we will have

00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:53,360
a full day of dedicated sprints so we

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,730
will be focusing on teaching people how

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,410
to contribute to core as well as

00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:59,480
providing space for people who are you

00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:05,089
know avid contributors where they can do

00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:06,199
a little bit more in-depth sprinting all

00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:07,910
right so now we're getting into the

00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:09,079
information about the session so Amanda

00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,149
I'm going to turn this over to you to

00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:13,220
kind of talk about how the programming

00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:16,630
team is structured and and how the

00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,630
session selection process goes

00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:28,270
can you hear me yes I can great so when

00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:30,700
Rachel and Megan came to India quite a

00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:32,380
few months ago they kind of were

00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,240
speaking with local community leaders

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:37,390
about what kind of content would be good

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,580
for a joke on Asia and the topics that

00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:42,130
came out of that kind of discussion in

00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,960
those surveys are these following tracks

00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,250
that we have below so if you click on

00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,320
that link you can see a track

00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,330
description about each one of those a

00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,730
little more in depth but these are the

00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:53,620
tracks that we will have each track will

00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,450
have about seven or eight sessions in

00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,940
each of them which gives us a total of

00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:04,690
fifty sessions for the con between those

00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:06,730
two days so if you've never submitted a

00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,530
session to drupalcon it's probably very

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,780
similar as if you've submitted it to a

00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:13,300
camp but basically you'll go through

00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:15,340
that link from the previous slide and

00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,530
you'll read the track description and in

00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,990
that it's a lot of information from the

00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,700
track chairs that explain kind of what

00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,440
the track is going to be about what kind

00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,080
of information they're looking for and

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,730
even some suggested topics of things

00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,110
that they're looking for sessions on

00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:33,460
that they think would be very valuable

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:35,410
to have at drupalcon so we always ask

00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,960
that you try and just create a session

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:40,540
submission that really tells about your

00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,550
topic we want to know what the topic is

00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,740
we want to kind of make sure that it's a

00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,410
exciting thing that isn't just

00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:49,270
regurgitating information want people to

00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,880
really want to know what you have to say

00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,500
and you kind of in your session

00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,080
submission need to be able to explain

00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,000
what you're going to cover and why that

00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,470
session needs to be at drupalcon you

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,620
need to make it as appealing as possible

00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:04,180
because if you followed other cons we do

00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,000
get hundreds and hundreds of submissions

00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:10,240
for only a few spots so trying to

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,680
provide as much information and explain

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,440
what you're going to teach you everyone

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,810
is very important we also ask you fill

00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,180
in your user profile this seems kind of

00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:21,160
like an easy thing and something that

00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,020
everyone would do but a lot of times we

00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,880
get sessions from people we aren't

00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,860
really sure who they are or if they've

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,170
been involved in the community or if

00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,310
they've presented before but if you just

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:32,830
want to fill out your profile it's

00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:34,300
really easy to just give us a little bit

00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,400
of information about yourself

00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,070
which helps us reach out to you if we

00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,620
have any questions and just so you know

00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:44,620
the deadline for submitting sessions is

00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,330
November second so you can also click on

00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:52,330
that link to go through the sessions

00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:53,620
submission process and just reminder if

00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,830
you have any questions about any of

00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,990
these topics feel free to post them in

00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:04,510
the questions box and we'll try and

00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:06,580
answer those as we go so just to kind of

00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:09,970
give you a quick overview of how

00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:12,130
sessions are selected when we close the

00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,810
call for papers on November second the

00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,880
selection committee will start reading

00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:19,660
over every single one of those sessions

00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:22,510
whether it's 300 or 1,000 they read

00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:24,670
through every single submission and what

00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:26,710
they're kind of looking for is what we

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,720
ask that you put in with your session

00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:31,240
submission on the previous slide is we

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,150
want topics that are fitting the track

00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,920
description that may be appealed to one

00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,450
of the topics that they suggested or

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,660
really fit into the theme that they're

00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:45,100
going for we get a lot of submissions

00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:46,420
with the same almost content we want to

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,940
make sure that we're not providing a

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,820
track with the same topic seven times so

00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,440
we are looking for kind of different

00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:56,590
categories to make sure that we're not

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,200
overlapping content or knowledge we want

00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:00,970
to see that the speaker has spoken at

00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,950
past events that doesn't have to mean a

00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:05,580
triple con it just means that you have

00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:08,380
speaking experience or you're confident

00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:10,750
in your knowledge you just want to make

00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:13,210
sure that when you get up in front of a

00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:15,220
stage of 400 drew police does that

00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:17,950
you're still excited to share that

00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,480
information and also that it's an

00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,760
exciting topic that we know that people

00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,400
at drupalcon Asia will want to hear so

00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,660
even if it doesn't show up in that track

00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,630
description and you think it's really

00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,430
exciting and definitely submit it one

00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:32,200
thing that people get a little nervous

00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,720
about sometimes is they're not sure

00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,130
which track to submit it to but we're

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,660
constantly reading through the

00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,970
submissions and so if you submit

00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,710
something to maybe site building and we

00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,660
think maybe it would be better in coding

00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,070
and development we don't just discard

00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,980
your session we definitely move it over

00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:50,830
and have the coding and development team

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,750
evaluate that so each selection

00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:56,230
committee has three people who are going

00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:57,820
to see on the next slide but it's at

00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:01,300
least three people and that really helps

00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,920
eliminate biases and by the 23rd of

00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,810
November after they've read through all

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,210
of these sessions and kind of ranked

00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:09,880
them to put together the best program

00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:12,400
per track possible all speakers will be

00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:15,760
notified by November 23rd when we

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,500
publish the selected sessions we get a

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,050
lot of questions of course about session

00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,150
selection and this is only a few seconds

00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:24,250
explaining it so if you want to know the

00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:26,890
real in-depth process feel free to click

00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:30,310
on the next link which is a lot of

00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:32,860
information about how we get from

00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:36,700
opening the website to selecting the

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:38,980
sessions all the steps we also wanted to

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,470
give you a heads up that the selection

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,970
committee as the sessions come in you

00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,500
can click on the proposed sessions you

00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:47,020
can see which ones have been submitted

00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:49,960
they're already reading through them so

00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:51,910
we encourage them as sessions come in to

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,610
kind of look them over to kind of have

00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:56,320
an idea what's coming in and if they

00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:58,420
have any questions we encourage them

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,850
also to reach out to the speaker that

00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:03,160
would be you if they may be want you to

00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:06,370
provide information or clarify something

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,440
so so keep an eye on your email or your

00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,970
doodle contact information just because

00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,520
we want to make sure if they're reaching

00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:14,410
out to you to try and make your session

00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,270
submission better that you get that

00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:21,880
email because it definitely could be a

00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:23,890
make-or-break kind of question so our

00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:27,070
session selection team is made up of

00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:31,210
kind of two prongs we have locals who

00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:33,220
are from basically the timezone of India

00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,070
and provide some regional oversight into

00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:39,730
the content that would be relevant for

00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:42,250
an Asia con we also have Global's who

00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:44,320
are people who have worked a drupalcon

00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,600
like this before and they kind of

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:50,140
provide some experience and guidance on

00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:54,400
the process not so much the specific

00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:56,620
nuances of each community's content but

00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,700
they provide a lot of help when it comes

00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:03,040
to the steps to pick this in

00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,020
shins and kind of Franken styles and

00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,270
just kind of when you get into a tough

00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,400
tough situation they've definitely done

00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:13,360
it at least once before and our great

00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:16,690
mentors in that aspect so these are the

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,870
local team as I mentioned when Rachel

00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:22,930
and Megan came to India a couple months

00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:24,400
ago during that survey and kind of

00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,950
discussion points these are people that

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,100
kind of rose to the top as people that

00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:31,750
would be great leaders for these

00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,520
different tracks and so they've been

00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,190
working really hard for over a month now

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,720
and they're really excited to be on the

00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,100
track team and helping select the

00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:45,880
sessions that will make up drupalcon

00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:49,570
Asia great uh so this kind of jumps into

00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:52,960
our Thursday excuse me our Thursday

00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:55,660
caught activities so we are planning on

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,700
having for training sessions one is

00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,780
again the Drupal in a day type training

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,280
something that's a little bit more

00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,320
entry-level there's not going to be a

00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,660
charge for that training and then there

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,800
will be two intermediate or skating

00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,710
three intermediate and advanced

00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:12,880
trainings for about 50 people each we

00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:15,610
are accepting training session proposals

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,590
right now so if you are a trainer or

00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,710
have a great idea for a training please

00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:23,290
go to the website and submit your

00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:26,050
training proposal and Amanda works with

00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:28,570
a training selection committee Amanda

00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:30,280
and Tina do and a man did you want to

00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,020
talk about how the the training

00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,920
selection works if it's different or

00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:38,650
similar to the session selection yeah

00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,970
it's very similar actually we definitely

00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:43,330
don't get as many submissions as

00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:45,580
sessions but we ask that people submit

00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,740
for trainings as you see we have the

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,050
different kinds of trainings and we work

00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,180
together with a committee that also

00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,440
involves the drupal association during

00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,840
training selection the drupal

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,780
association plays no part in selecting

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,460
the sessions besides notifying people

00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:04,630
but in the training selection because we

00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:06,700
are part of the group that is charging

00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,490
for the trainings we do get partial say

00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,810
but right now we have MIDI on the

00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:12,490
committee and we're working to find

00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,460
additional training selection committee

00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,409
members

00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,450
this is a little more difficult because

00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:20,419
we want to make sure that we have a

00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:21,740
selection person that is not going to

00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:23,750
submit a training we want to make sure

00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,970
we eliminate all of those biases so

00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:28,250
we're working to still flush out that

00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:30,649
training selection committee but we go

00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:34,520
through and if you look through the

00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:37,429
training link there you can see what

00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,980
kind of criteria were looking for so

00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:41,690
when we go through with the selection we

00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,600
have the whole training committee on the

00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:46,640
phone and we make sure that we identify

00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,610
the trainings that meet those

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,409
qualifications as well as don't overlap

00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:54,409
content wise we don't want to have to

00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:56,600
trainings on front end theming or two

00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:58,909
trainings on the same thing so we just

00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,440
really work out the content that we

00:21:58,909 --> 00:22:04,490
think would be best for the Asian

00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:09,380
community as well as finding for that

00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:12,320
work cohesively together great and we

00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:14,570
also are planning on three summits we

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,390
are committed to a business summit and

00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:19,970
Rahul Dhawan is our lead for that and we

00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:22,460
are looking at possibly having a higher

00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:24,320
ed summit and a government summit rap

00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,630
sheet and Ani have been very passionate

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,399
about those and are working on proposals

00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:31,070
for those two summits if anyone has any

00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:35,450
other summit proposals feel free to get

00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:38,510
in touch with Amanda or I so this is our

00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:41,360
general program plan for the schedule

00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:44,539
for the days we this made shift a little

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,429
bit obviously but at this point we're

00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:48,260
starting on a little bit later start

00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:51,350
time than what we would do in North

00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:53,260
America or Europe but but essentially it

00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:57,890
follows a similar structure to how we

00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:59,179
how we operate the other cards so again

00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,980
you can just kind of see Thursday the

00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:02,899
training in some it's Friday and

00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:07,870
Saturday that the con programming and

00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:11,110
then Sunday the sprints so

00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:13,210
oh speaking of sprints we have quite a

00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:15,340
bit of detail on our website during the

00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,650
con we will have our contribution lounge

00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:20,530
so people can sprint throughout the four

00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:22,540
days and on Sunday we are really

00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,980
focusing exclusively on Sprint's so we

00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:27,670
have a first-time sprinter workshop

00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:30,400
which is really aimed for people who

00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:32,530
maybe have not contributed back to the

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,600
project yet so it go it covers

00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:37,030
everything from setting up Drupal on

00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,930
your machine to identifying issues and

00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:40,720
what the different types of

00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:43,120
contributions can be there's also a corm

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,250
entered sprint which is for maybe people

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,660
who've contributed a little bit but are

00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:48,640
just kind of you know dipping their toes

00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:50,920
into into that world and so there are

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,530
sprint mentors available to help them

00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:55,840
answer questions and find kind of that

00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:57,970
next level of engagement there and then

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,620
there's the general sprints which is for

00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:01,990
people that are just there to sprint and

00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,460
just kind of dive right in so that

00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:05,620
that's something that kind of our more

00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:08,770
veteran sprinters will participate with

00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:10,570
and I know that the local community is

00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:12,820
looking into possibly finding some space

00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:15,610
for extended Sprint's which is great so

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:17,770
possibly there's there may be additional

00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:19,630
sprinting opportunities before and after

00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:22,920
the con for those that want to extend

00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:26,230
their their time at drupalcon Asia and

00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:29,080
as far as the Sprint leads go there's

00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:30,700
similar to how the program team is

00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,880
structured there's locals and Global's

00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:36,580
the Global's can provide insights as to

00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:39,340
how Sprint's have operated in in other

00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:42,250
locations and then the locals are you

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:44,110
know helpful for executing it on site if

00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,020
you want to get involved with Sprint's

00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:48,340
there are a ton of ways to do that

00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:51,400
simply by showing up its prints as well

00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:53,530
as one way but you can also be signed up

00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,870
to be a sprint mentor and if you're

00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:58,090
interested in helping organize the

00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,890
Sprint's feel free to sign up as a

00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:01,390
course Corps mentor there's a link there

00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:03,250
and I'll be sending out the slides

00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:05,920
afterwards so you can access easily

00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:08,530
click on all the links and then there's

00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:12,360
also a mentoring group that you can join

00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:12,360
to participate in the sprint planning

00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,789
alright

00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:18,470
so as far as volunteering for the con

00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:22,130
there are still a lot of ways to

00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:23,600
volunteer we have set up a web form here

00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:25,730
for people that are interested in

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,490
volunteering but maybe don't know

00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:31,070
exactly what what volunteering role

00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:33,470
speaks to them yet you can sign up at

00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,880
that web form and stay in communication

00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:38,149
with us we will let you know as

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,090
volunteer opportunities arise the Drupal

00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:43,909
cons across the world really depend on

00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:45,399
volunteers so anything that people are

00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:47,620
willing to contribute as far as

00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:50,840
providing their time is really helpful

00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:52,309
and our main community contacts are

00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,580
listed there if you're really interested

00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:58,070
in community activities or social media

00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:02,779
or promotion or a cheat onion par thur

00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:03,950
are the people to reach out to and at

00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:05,809
the end I'll go over some other ways

00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:08,419
that people can can kind of get involved

00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:12,559
your find ways to help help promote the

00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:14,779
cons so one of the great things about

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,450
Drupal cons is we offer grants and

00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:19,100
scholarships drupalcon is often

00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,990
something that people are very eager to

00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:24,260
attend but may not financially be able

00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:26,539
to afford to and so we have set aside

00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,460
some funds for drupalcon asia to make

00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:30,289
sure that people have access to the con

00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,269
that may not be able to afford to go on

00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:35,649
their own one of the things that was

00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:39,260
important to us is really supporting the

00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:41,210
area she's mean india and the area

00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,769
immediately around in india we really

00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,929
want to kind of focus on the south asia

00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:46,760
region so about eighty percent of those

00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:49,309
funds will be dedicated to people from

00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,080
that region and coming to india as a

00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:53,659
dream for people across the world so we

00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,730
wanted to make sure that people outside

00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:58,159
of just that South Asia region also have

00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:59,570
access to that so for twenty percent of

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:04,669
the funds will be dedicated to people

00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:06,470
coming in from abroad the you are open

00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:09,080
the scholarships and grants are open for

00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:11,240
applications now those will close on

00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,970
November second so there's a about a

00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:16,279
month and a half left to apply and we

00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:17,720
recommend that you do so before then

00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:22,590
because we really don't have any ability

00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:23,880
to extend that all right mark

00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:27,210
so I'm going to turn it over to Lee

00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:29,970
Carver to speak about her me yeah we can

00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:33,000
go ahead Lee sorry I didn't mean to cut

00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:35,690

I'm in charge of marketing I'm actually

00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:40,500
sort of the representative of the

00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:43,409
marketing go back sorry here we go

00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:45,659
that's okay but I'm representative of

00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:49,260
the whole marketing arm of the drupal

00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:50,909
association so um I'm the associations

00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,770
content writer we have other marketers

00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:55,830
who are n communicators who are on board

00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:57,210
I'm Phil is also probably going to be

00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:01,590
working on drupalcon a little bit as

00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:03,690
well he is my supervisor so the who's

00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:06,779
who of the marketing team for this

00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:09,149
drupalcon and we have aside from myself

00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:11,760
we've four main touch touch point people

00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:15,320
so the first is Paul Johnson he is based

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:17,399
out of the UK and he is a veteran at

00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,350
volunteering for drupalcon on the

00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:21,480
marketing side he runs all of the

00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:24,149
drupalcon social media accounts and

00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:27,149
really does a fantastic job and he and

00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:31,080
Ani will be running the drupalcon Asia

00:28:27,149 --> 00:28:33,870
social-media handles together parth is

00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,850
going to be handling a lot of what we're

00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:38,909
calling guerrilla marketing internally

00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:43,020
so he's going out to various events in

00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:45,029
the local region and I'm trying to drum

00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:47,010
up some noise and enthusiasm he has a

00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:50,130
number of raffle tickets that he'll be a

00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:52,350
of conjugates that he'll be raffling

00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:55,950
away and he's working with a whole bunch

00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:58,590
of local volunteers to just um drum up

00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:00,779
excitement in person and last of all we

00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:03,299
have Priyanka who is working with in

00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:05,520
this way they're partnering with us to

00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:10,470
do some more enterprise level marketing

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:14,010
so she'll be focusing on one creating

00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:16,580
content for the audience that we're

00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:19,230
trying to draw the drip akan so mainly a

00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:21,659
Indian audience member some Asian

00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:23,669
audience members as well because that's

00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:25,649
just frankly a part of the world that

00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:26,730
were not all that familiar with so she's

00:29:25,649 --> 00:29:29,070
going to be helping with that she's

00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:31,740
going to do some outreach to Drupal

00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:33,090
businesses throughout Asia as well and

00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,509
we're really excited to have her and

00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:39,239
then from a standpoint of

00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:41,879
content that is created and goes on the

00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:43,589
drupalcon Asia site that will mainly be

00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:48,239
coming from us at the drupal association

00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:53,999
so branded emails blogs and a variety of

00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:55,409
social and pains will be us so because

00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:58,199
I'm a very visual person I went ahead

00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:59,309
and put together a diagram of who our

00:29:58,199 --> 00:30:01,979
volunteers are and what their

00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:03,509
responsibilities are so as you can see

00:30:01,979 --> 00:30:05,369
there's those of us at the drupal

00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:08,159
association at top creating content and

00:30:05,369 --> 00:30:11,519
that feeds down into the drupalcon asia

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,259
site and so Paul and ani are Manning

00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,179
what I think of is the tweet cannon so

00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:18,059
they're they're sending all that content

00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:19,469
out through social media priyanka will

00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:21,479
be working on business interest and

00:30:19,469 --> 00:30:24,239
again advising us in helping us create

00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:25,799
regional specific content and that

00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:28,529
actually does feed back into the drupal

00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:30,239
caucasian site and then last of all is

00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:33,269
parth who is doing the guerrilla

00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:35,519
marketing and he will be just going out

00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:39,029
and being the face of how excited we are

00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:42,989
and working with locals to really drum

00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:46,589
up some excitement all right great

00:30:42,989 --> 00:30:48,539
thanks Lee you're welcome so as far as

00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:50,609
sponsorship goes megan is selling

00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:52,139
drupalcon Asia sponsorships and we want

00:30:50,609 --> 00:30:54,149
to say a special special thank you to

00:30:52,139 --> 00:30:56,609
raul priyanka onion red sheet who have

00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:58,559
been helpful and helping us connect with

00:30:56,609 --> 00:31:02,129
people that want to sponsor drupalcon

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:04,440
asia we've had a really strong pick up

00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:06,690
of sponsorships so far and that's really

00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,669
wonderful we have a variety of price

00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:10,319
points for people that are sort of yet

00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:12,749
to sign up and are still interested and

00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:18,429
the prospectus is on the website under

00:31:12,749 --> 00:31:20,610
the become a sponsor section so

00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:24,669
as a little bit of the behind-the-scenes

00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:26,559
process India has a complex tax system

00:31:24,669 --> 00:31:27,850
which I'm guessing if you've done

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,369
business in India you're probably

00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:32,169
familiar with so we're we're finalizing

00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:35,259
our memorandum of understanding and that

00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:37,139
really will kind of dictate the tax laws

00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:39,580
as they apply to both sponsorships and

00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:43,360
registrants people paying ticketing

00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:46,269
prices so that will dictate how how

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:51,850
those taxes are applied and will include

00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:54,009
any local district wide Texas so the

00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:56,129
drupal association is investing in this

00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:59,499
event as a mission-driven initiative

00:31:56,129 --> 00:32:02,499
similar to how drupalcon latin america

00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:04,929
was set up we are operating this as a

00:32:02,499 --> 00:32:09,249
negative net revenue because it directly

00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:10,629
supports our mission and so that's kind

00:32:09,249 --> 00:32:14,049
of a bit of a behind the scenes as far

00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:15,580
as how financially the budget is

00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:17,350
structured both from a from a

00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:19,419
sponsorship and ticketing standpoint and

00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:24,480
then expenses so we were really excited

00:32:19,419 --> 00:32:27,940
to come and and invest into this region

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,529
so the there are a host of ways that

00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:33,669
people can get involved kind of on an

00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:36,249
individual level here it are the ways

00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:38,080
that are easy to jump in right now so

00:32:36,249 --> 00:32:39,850
submit a session or a training we we

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,590
again are looking for those session

00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:45,009
submissions that we can use to build a

00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:46,840
really strong program and as far as

00:32:45,009 --> 00:32:48,940
trainings go I was lucky enough to sit

00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,619
in on a training and at drupalcamp Delhi

00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,929
and so I know that there are fabulous

00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:55,299
trainers and trainings happening all

00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:57,129
over India so feel free to submit away

00:32:55,299 --> 00:32:58,779
and the other thing I would really

00:32:57,129 --> 00:33:00,820
recommend is not just yourself

00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:01,929
submitting a session but if you if you

00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,549
heard a really great session by a

00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:05,889
speaker or if you attended a really

00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:09,220
great training reach out to those people

00:33:05,889 --> 00:33:12,490
and invite them to to submit frequently

00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:14,169
people who are invited to submit will do

00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:17,350
so and so that's a really great way to

00:33:14,169 --> 00:33:18,970
spread the word also you can as I said

00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:21,340
you can apply for grants and

00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:23,289
scholarships through November fourth we

00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:26,200
we have those funds available to make

00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:27,789
sure that people who got the cost of

00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,929
travel may be prohibitive we want to

00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:31,359
make sure that we can lower those

00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:32,290
barriers wherever we can if you're

00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:33,370

00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:35,800
supporting Sprint's you can sign up for

00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:37,120
now to be a sprint mentor and if you're

00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,560
just interested in volunteering you're

abreast of any new opportunities and

00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,660
most importantly just ask so if you are

00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,190
really eager to get involved with one

00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,200
aspect of the con but you don't quite

00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:54,970
know the best way to jump right in just

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,530
contact one of us on the staff or

00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:58,570
anybody that you saw mentioned in this

00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:59,800
presentation kind of a correlation we

00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:03,490
have a lot of really great local

00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:05,080
volunteers and point people you we can

00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:07,300
make sure that you get connected with

00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:09,460
the right person and find the way to be

00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,929
involved in Triple Crown Asia and of

00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,000
course when in doubt use the contact us

00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:15,160
form on the website that sends an email

00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,720
directly to Tina and she is happy to

00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:21,310
route you to the right person so we

00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,020
talked a bit about what are in our

00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:25,570
budget and in our plans and some of the

00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:29,770
things that are not in our budget and in

00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:30,880
the the DA's direct plans are as follows

00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:32,860
and these are things that really the

00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,210
community could champion and run with

00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,970
and we would be happy to support however

00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:38,560
we can whether it be by you know

00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:39,970
promotion or marketing getting the word

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,510
out but they're just not something that

00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:45,850
we fiscally can support or logistic Lee

00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:47,110
can support so true trivia night is a

00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,340
great example that's something that if

00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,540
you've been to another drupalcon is

00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:51,400
something that people get really excited

00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:53,410
about and we would be happy to help

00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,640
support that with connecting to the

00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:56,590
people who have run trivia and I in the

00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:58,300
past but we just don't have it in the

00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:01,300
budget at this point to be able to

00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:02,890
produce the event ourselves extended

00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,690
sprints I mentioned earlier that local

00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:06,280
community leads are already looking for

00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:08,950
ways to possibly extend that sprint

00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,010
experience for people so allowing people

00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:14,230
to sprint either before or after the con

00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:16,210
another great thing that that happens at

00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:19,350
other Drupal cons as cultural events so

00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:22,050
i remember in amsterdam there were a

00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:24,940
museum pass for one night of the week or

00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:27,580
you know an evening hosted by the local

00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:30,070
amsterdam community to kind of get to

00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:31,960
know the city so those things are we are

00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:34,120
very welcome for the community to

00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,040
organize and we are happy to promote I'm

00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,650
another thing that's really exciting is

00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,420
for the Drupal gamers ideas so the

00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:43,510
Drupal gangers is really essentially the

00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:46,000
the partners or spouses of Drupal errs

00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:48,850
who come along to the events and are

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,980
either you know going on tours or maybe

00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:53,950
going to a museum together or getting to

00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:55,960
know a city as a group so if anybody has

00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:57,580
any of those ideas or would like to kind

00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:02,890
of put together some recommendations

00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:04,690
that that's really wonderful so kind of

00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:07,300
in summary just where we are and what's

00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:09,220
next so the triple Association we really

00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,230
we provide the drupalcon project

00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:13,210
management in the process we kind of

00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:16,120
provide the structure of how to how to

00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:17,920
get this big event done but really the

00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,740
community fills the program and so the

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,530
community is you know obviously provide

00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:25,380
leading the sessions participating at

00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:28,530
the Sprint's leading those friends and

00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:31,900
and kind of providing those community

00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:34,240
activities that that fill the con and

00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:37,180
really make it what it is so we we help

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,550
kind of organize make sure we get you

00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:41,410
know food there and have have everything

00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:43,870
kind of ordered and everything organized

00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:45,460
for the event but again really I just

00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:47,110
want to reiterate like it's the

00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:49,180
community leads the process and selects

00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:50,740
the sessions and and fills those seats

00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:53,680
and it's just really a wonderful

00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:55,720
community event again anyone can be

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,940

from a from a planning perspective I

00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:07,180
think drupalcon Asia activity from the

00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:09,760

00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:11,950
