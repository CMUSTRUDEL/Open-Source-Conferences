Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: INTRODUCTION TO PANOPOLY AND DRUPAL DISTRIBUTIONS
Publication date: 2014-06-04
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: dsnopek
When you first install Drupal, it's a blank slate - it doesn't really do anything yet. If you want a personal blog, company website, intranet portal or e-commerce store - you need to start installing modules and actually configuring your website into one of those things.

That's where Drupal distributions come in! A Drupal distribution is Drupal plus some modules, themes and configuration, so that when you first install it does something right out of the box.

In this presentation, David Snopek (one of the Panopoly co-maintainers) is going to talk about (and demonstrate!) a Drupal distribution called Panopoly. Panopoly has many great features for site builders and users right out of the box:

- In-place page building
- Responsive layouts
- WYSIWYG
- Media support
- Improved admin experience
- Improved content editing experience
- Awesome reusable widgets
- ... and more MAGIC!

Panopoly allows you start building your website from the 10th floor, rather than the ground up!

We'll also touch on one of the more advanced uses of Panopoly: building your own distribution on top of it! If you find yourself building several similar sites, you may want to consider creating your own distribution so you don't have to do the same configuration over and over again. While building a new distribution from scratch can be challenging, Panopoly can serve as a "base distribution" and handle much of the heavy lifting for you.

hi everyone before we get properly

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,470

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,660
understand who you guys are and try and

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,790
make this better suited to your needs

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,740
who here considers themselves a

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,130
developers you write PHP or JavaScript

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:20,310
code who here considers themselves a

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,630
site builder so you configure sites

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,680
install modules but don't necessarily

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,260
write code

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,590
how about users so you use a site that

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,000
someone else built okay well I'm really

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,859
glad I asked cuz there's far more

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,070
developers here than I was expecting for

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,660
a site builder track presentation how

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:41,460
about how many people consider

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:45,480
themselves a beginner beginner site

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:52,129
building I guess Drupal yeah okay how

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:54,809
about intermediate and advanced okay so

00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:57,360
this presentation is definitely mostly

00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:00,570
geared towards site builders on the

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,600
beginner and intermediate end definitely

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,729
this stuff for users you know if you see

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,010
something that you think is awesome here

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,750
and you can go bug the person who built

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,290
your site say hey Drupal can do this

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,760
thing why can't our site do that and

00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,979
definitely the the second half of the

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,080
presentation is is more advanced we're

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,630
gonna be talking in general about what

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,950
Drupal distributions are maybe you

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,500
should consider using one maybe you

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,570
should consider creating one and then

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:35,100
we're gonna look in specific at panoply

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:37,290
which is a Drupal distribution okay so

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,060
I'm David snow Peck I'm a freelance

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,310
Drupal developer I'm one of the co

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,790
maintainer of panoply and twenty or so

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,960
other Drupal modules on one other thing

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,840
I want to say if you if you have a

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,610
question just like hold up your hand or

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,409
yell it out and I'll repeat it to the

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,060
microphone unless I forget and then also

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,610
yell that out that I should repeat it

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,979
into the microphone that helps me

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,509
understand if you guys are understanding

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:05,820
what I'm saying if I should slow down

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:07,469
and explain something better so we've

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,239
been at Drupal camp tool as our Drupal

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:11,910
con for the last couple of days talking

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,650
about things you can do with Drupal what

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:18,120
are some of the types of sites

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,620
that you can build with Drupal come on

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,750
guys yell something out what's a type of

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,829
site you can build with Drupal I'm sorry

00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:31,590
Commerce signed an e-commerce site what

00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:34,290
else a blog company Internet yeah what

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,390
was the last one yeah like an events

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:41,909
calendar and some sort of event planner

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:43,709
I put a couple of those on my slides but

00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:46,019
really like the possibilities are

00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:48,389
unlimited I'm not really aware of a

00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,340
class of site that you couldn't build

00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:51,750
with Drupal I mean sometimes there's

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,760
other considerations that might make

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,560
another platform better in a certain

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,010
situation but you can build pretty much

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,079
anything but what does Drupal give you

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,900
out-of-the-box immediately after install

00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:05,069
who here is installed Drupal 7 or at

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,560
least seen what it looks like out of the

00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:11,959
box sweet so for those of you who

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:14,879
haven't seen it you get this blue thing

00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,970
which is sort of a simple blog with a

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,340
not-so-great content editing experience

00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:22,319
the thing is nobody actually wants this

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,329
thing you know when you're hoping and

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,250
dreaming about your new website you're

00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:29,250
not thinking of this you know this meets

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,650
no client requirements document ever you

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,030
couldn't go live with this you know

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,849
you're gonna have to dig through the

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,889
twenty six thousand modules on

00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:40,650
drupal.org find the things you need

00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:42,060
install them configure them mold it into

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,489
the site that you actually want and

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,590
that's the power of Drupal right you

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,079
know whatever you want to do there's a

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:53,129
module for that but that work is up to

00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:55,590
you out of the box what most people

00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:58,440
actually want is something that sort of

00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:01,769
feels like a website this screenshot is

00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:04,319
from a Drupal distribution called open

00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:07,319
public for creating local government

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,479
websites after you install it it's a

00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:12,419
website for a local government right

00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:14,159
with demo data all you have to do is go

00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,169
through there replace the demo data with

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,760
actual information about your local

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:21,900
government and you could go live with

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:24,180
that in a matter of hours yeah you need

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,639
the core functionality for your site

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,310
this

00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,590
screenshot is from commerce kickstart

00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:34,909
which after you install it has a product

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:36,439
catalog checkout shopping cart all the

00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:40,849
basic functionality of an e-commerce

00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:42,800
site and you know it's built on Drupal

00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:44,449
commerce which is a fleet of modules for

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,340
creating sort of infinitely flexible

00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:49,189
ecommerce systems you could create

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,319
anything with it not just you know as

00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:52,969
shop with products but it's so much

00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:55,639
easier when you're starting out to

00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:57,710
install something that works and modify

00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,060
it rather than starting from scratch and

00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,080
having to build it up when you're

00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,639
beginning you know if you're already a

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,800
Drupal commerce expert the story is

00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:09,050
different in short people want something

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,659
that is as close as possible to their

00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,240
end goal out of the box you know if

00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:15,529
you're building an e-commerce site you

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,300
want to worry about the products you're

00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:19,550
gonna offer the deals you're gonna do

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,740
not creating basic shopping cart

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,060
functionality if you're creating a blog

00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,500
you want to be thinking about the

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,960
articles you're gonna write not

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,969
implementing you know basic comments and

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,919
social sharing and all that stuff you

00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:32,960
want to worry about the unique value

00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:35,379
proposition of your site and not you

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,229
know monkeying around with the plumbing

00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:42,319
and if you work at an organization with

00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:44,419
lots of sites or you're a freelance site

00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,009
builder or work at a Drupal shop you

00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:48,349
know and you're creating sites every day

00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:50,779
there's probably some configuration you

00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:52,580
do on every single new site would it be

00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:56,750
great if Drupal just came out of the box

00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:59,389
that way so this is where Drupal

00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,800
distributions come in who here's

00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:03,050
familiar with the idea of a Drupal

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,810
distribution already oh sweet lots of

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,610
people so for those who haven't heard of

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,310
this before a Drupal distribution is

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:13,810
Drupal prepackaged with a set of modules

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:17,060
and themes and also some configuration

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,650
so you install it just like Drupal but

00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,759
out of the box it actually does

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:24,830
something and the great thing is that it

00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:27,050
still is Drupal right so if the

00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:29,569
distribution does X but you really need

00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:32,120
X plus y you can still dig into that

00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:36,250
pool of 26,000 contribs

00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:38,449
extend it so here are some popular

00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,440
open-source distributions these are

00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:41,450
projects you can

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,230
download off of drupal.org and install

00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:48,140
right away commerce kickstart we already

00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:50,330
talked about open public open atrium for

00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:54,940
building an internal collaboration tool

00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:57,200
for an organization to be your intranet

00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,640
Drupal Commons for creating an online

00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:03,380
community if you want to have your own

00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:04,600
Facebook Open Academy University

00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,440
Department sites

00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,610
júlio school and high school web sites

00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,700
demo framework this is a really

00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:15,590
interesting example Acquia makes demo

00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,690
framework I'm sure everyone's familiar

00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,950
with arc we have here not they're one of

00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,050
the biggest Drupal shops

00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,030
Driss the founder of the Drupal project

00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:26,450
works there also the founder of Acquia

00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:28,100
anyway when they go to a client to try

00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,930
and sell them on the idea of Drupal to

00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,270
give them a demo of Drupal they don't

00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,490
show them Drupal 7 out of the box

00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,410
instead they take this Drupal

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,840
distribution which has a lot of the

00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:41,600
common modules you can set it up for

00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,250
common use cases already built out for

00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,720
the way you would see in actual

00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,720
production site and show them that

00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,350
herbal it's an internal project

00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:53,810
management and customer management tools

00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,190
so if you ran a Drupal shop and you

00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,260
wanted to manage all of your projects

00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:01,070
internally using a Drupal site you

00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:03,740
totally could with herbal and panoply

00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:08,590
which we'll be talking about in some

00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:10,669
detail very soon so those were all

00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:13,310
public distributions those are like

00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:15,520
products you can download and use but

00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:18,500
lots of organizations also create custom

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,960
distributions for use internally just to

00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:24,770
make their own lives easier here's some

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,780
big examples but you know who knows how

00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,550
many others right no one's under any

00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,490
obligation to tell us that they made an

00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,770
internal distribution it they can keep

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,469
that private and these are some big

00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:38,539
examples but even small to medium sized

00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:40,849
organizations can benefit from creating

00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:43,310
an internal distribution as a freelance

00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:44,360
Drupal developer I've created internal

00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:48,620
distributions for a number of

00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,700
organizations on the smaller end so

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,380
here's some reasons why you might want

00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:56,620
to do that you know if you're a drupe

00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:59,260
shop you probably don't create entirely

00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,330
unique sites every time you probably

00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,740
operate in some niche so you could

00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,660
create a distribution that does all of

00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,090
that same setup you're doing on every

00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:12,370
site out of the box reduce the work you

00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:13,750
do if you have a number of sites like a

00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,150
university or government where you're

00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,830
launching new sites all the time you

00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:21,390
build out your distribution once and

00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,390
then deploy as many times as you'd like

00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:27,700
so an alternative to creating a

00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:29,740
distribution is just cloning sites right

00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,170
you build out one site and then you're

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,950
about to launch site number two which is

00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,720
going to have some of the same

00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,760
functionality so you just clone the

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,960
first site and then modify it right and

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,880
that could work except when you have to

00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,530
change some of that shared functionality

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,330
between both sides now you have to login

00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,890
to site number one and change it and log

00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,200
into site number two and change it and

00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:52,690
maybe with two sites that could work too

00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,540
right but not with ten sites or 50 sites

00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:58,030
or hundred sites instead if you create a

00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,400
distribution you can just update the

00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:04,650
distribution and then that will deploy

00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,650
to all your V all of your existing sites

00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:11,650
so what is panoply panoply is at least

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,240
three things which makes it a little

00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:16,180
hard to explain and certainly a lot

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,610
harder for us to develop the first thing

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:21,490
is that it is a Drupal distribution

00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:23,170
itself but it's a starter distribution

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,660
it's a blank slate like the way that

00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,520
Drupal 7 core is a blank slate it

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,010
doesn't you know impose in a use case on

00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,080
you but we think of it as an improved

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:35,020
blank slate it includes a number of

00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,990
things that a lot of people want for

00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:40,210
example WYSIWYG media support responsive

00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,280
layouts and some panel stuff which we'll

00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:45,280
talk about a little bit later but if

00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,440
you're just getting into Drupal you're

00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,260
just getting into site building starting

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,540
with panoply I think can be a better

00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,610
place to start then with vanilla Drupal

00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:57,480
7 I hope I'll be able to convince you of

00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:01,510
that when we get to the demo portion

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,370
panoply is also a base distribution who

00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:07,060
here is familiar with the idea of a base

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:09,580
theme okay about half

00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:12,130
so a theme in Drupal is what controls

00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,870
the visual appearance of a site so when

00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,810
you want to make your site look unique

00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,640
you create your own theme you can create

00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,350
your own theme from scratch starting

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,840
from the beginning or instead you could

00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:25,390
start from a base theme some common

00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,730
examples are Zen Omega adaptive theme

00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:30,160
and that allows you to take advantage of

00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,930
some of this shared work that the

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,610
community is already done and allowing

00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:37,390
you to focus more on what makes your

00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:39,160
design unique so panoply is a base

00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:41,350
distribution in the same way you know

00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,690
Zen is a base theme and you can build

00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,940
your own distribution on it and save

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:49,120
some of the you know low-level work some

00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,470
of the decision about approach and just

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,300
focus on what makes your distribution

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:58,240
unique who hears familiar with the

00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,890
features module who hears actually

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,920
created a feature with the features

00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:04,600
module okay if you're a site builder and

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,830
you're at the sort of intermediate level

00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,140
and you want to take your game to the

00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,710
advanced level definitely go learn about

00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,880
the futures module it's super useful

00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:15,130
with the features module allows you to

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,840
do is to take some of the configuration

00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,090
you did in your Drupal site so the

00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,790
pointing clicking you know configuring

00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:24,010
content types creating views and export

00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,680
that automatically into a module and

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:29,080
then you can take that module and enable

00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,910
it on another site and it will make that

00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:35,310
configuration happen on that other side

00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:38,470
so it's a way of reusing configuration

00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:40,480
between different sites and panoply is

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:43,240
actually made up of about a dozen or so

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,070
features modules that provide like each

00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,200
of the individual things that panoply

00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,330
does so there's like a panoply admin

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,850
module which does the admin improvements

00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:54,400
a panoply WYSIWYG module that sets up

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:56,710
the WYSIWYG so if you wanted to take

00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,660
just a piece of what panoply does and

00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,430
put it on your vanilla Drupal site you

00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,870
totally can like if you liked the

00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:04,000
WYSIWYG stuff and wanted that on your

00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,340
Drupal site you can just download the

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,470
panoply WYSIWYG module run the make file

00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:13,270
and install it so yeah to try and

00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:16,000
summarize this rather complicated slide

00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:17,380
you know it's the set of modules when

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,720
you install the distribution you're

00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,740
basically getting them all at once but

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,390
you could also take them

00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,740
piecemeal and you can use that as a

00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:28,510
basis of creating your own distribution

00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:30,850
if you wanted so one of the main focuses

00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,530
of panoply is improving the user

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,660
experience and you'll see a lot of this

00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:36,790
when we get to the demo portion but

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,740
right away I just want to explain some

00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:43,060
of the user experience principles that

00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:45,070
we use in panoply so first of all we try

00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,140
to do a lot of the obvious user

00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,820
experience improvements that pretty much

00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,440
everyone is already doing anyway

00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,150
right if you're an experienced site

00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,950
builder there's a set of modules and

00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,330
things you do on every site and all

00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:58,740
experience site builders are doing

00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:01,300
roughly the same thing for example

00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,700
installing one of the modules that puts

00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,740
a filter on the modules page I mean we

00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,450
could argue over which module should we

00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,400
use to do that but I think we could all

00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:12,480
agree that having a filter on the

00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:15,250
modules page is objectively better or

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,690
replacing the out-of-the-box content

00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,280
list page with the one that comes from

00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,340
the admin views module I don't know

00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:23,620
anyone who prefers the built-in one you

00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,810
know the the one in admin views is

00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,610
objectively better so rather than

00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,500
everyone having to relearn all of these

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,940
sort of best practice obvious UX

00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:35,470
improvements we just put them in there

00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:37,630
out-of-the-box so we want to keep users

00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:40,770
and site managers on the front end of

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:43,450
the site and off of the back end so

00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:45,460
rather than them seeing a page and

00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:47,380
having to sort of figure out what is

00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:49,510
that page is that a view is that a panel

00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:51,040
and having to go then dig into the back

00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,990
end to the appropriate place to change

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,250
it learn how to use that and change it

00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:59,560
you know we want to allow them to change

00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:01,870
this content on a page while being on

00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,220
the same page that they're viewing it so

00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:06,520
editing things were they're displayed

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,560
rather than digging into the backend we

00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,050
want to keep the drupal isms behind the

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,270
scenes so any internet literate user

00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:15,220
should be able to easily understand the

00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:17,470
concepts that they need to know in order

00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,270
to customize their site they shouldn't

00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,250
have to know what a view or a block or a

00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,960
panel is in order to do the type of

00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,120
customization that we want to allow them

00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,560
to do and this applies to users and site

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,210
managers right because if you're the

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,890
site builder you're stuck with Drupal

00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,960
isms you know you have to know these

00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:34,680
things but we don't want to require our

00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,680
users to

00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:41,170
yeah and trying to show live previews

00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:44,350
and previews wherever possible

00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:46,030
you know we shouldn't have the action of

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,670
changing something really far removed

00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:51,640
from seeing its effect you know for

00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:53,740
example to change a block on a page

00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,020
you'd have to go to admin structure

00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,520
blocks you know add a new blog set up

00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,680
some configuration press save and

00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,180
nothing happens right you have to go all

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,340
the way back to the front-end to see it

00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,410
happening so trying to show users the

00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:12,250
effects of their changes as quickly as

00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:13,450
possible so panels has a lot of love and

00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:16,810
a lot of hates there's a lot of strong

00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:19,600
emotions about panels who here has used

00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:24,240
the panel's module before Wow who here

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:26,650
loves panels who here hates panels

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,450
awesome then this slide is a purpose who

00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:32,940
here has mixed feelings about panels

00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:36,220
that's pretty much everybody yeah so I

00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:38,440
started out in the hating panels camp

00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,270
definitely I'm a developer so for me

00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,920
panels is just another pointy clicky

00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,330
thing and I don't want to do pointy

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,220
clicky things I want to write code right

00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:47,830
and a lot of site builders don't like

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,540
panels because it's complicated there's

00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,130
a whole bunch of new terminology and

00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,710
concepts you need to learn there's a

00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:55,360
learning curve the page manager which is

00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:57,190
the default user interface for working

00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,030
with panels is confusing it's

00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:03,550
complicated but it was panoply that

00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:06,070
really won me over into the the loving

00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:08,670
panel's camp and I think it's because of

00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:11,199
the way that we have chosen to use it

00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:13,270
we're not just including panels in the

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,360
page manager but the best of the panel's

00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:18,339
ecosystem so about a half dozen other

00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:21,939
modules that improve panels that extend

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:24,490
it here are a couple of the big ones we

00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:26,680
also try to hide the nastiness from

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:29,890
users which is mainly the page manager

00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,930
the golden rule of panoply is that users

00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:34,330
and site managers will never see the

00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:36,960
page manager instead we give them an

00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:42,040
alternate interface called the IPE

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:44,770
so if your only experience with panels

00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,090
is with panels in the page manager what

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,500
you're going to see in the demo with

00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:51,460
panoply is going to be

00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:53,260
new to you and the way that we use all

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,170
these things together allows you to

00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:59,410
create really amazing experiences for

00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:01,510
your users and site managers and you can

00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:03,400
create these experiences even without

00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:05,170
writing any code you know you can do it

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,940
using views using feel double panel

00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:09,400
panes which is really just another way

00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,080
of saying entities and fields and we'll

00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:15,400
talk about that a little bit when we get

00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:17,980
to the demo so actually here comes the

00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:22,440
the demo this can be a mixture of slides

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:25,900
and actually looking at a panoply sign

00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:29,580
so the first thing that panoply does is

00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:31,720
it enables a bunch of super popular

00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,950
contributors if you've done any site

00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,140
building in the past you probably

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,910
recognize a lot of these maybe some of

00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,200
the ones towards the middle are panels

00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:43,740
specific stuff you might not recognize

00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:45,940
but you know views pathauto WYSIWYG

00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:49,870
jQuery update I mean these are modules

00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:53,290
that everyone is using and panoply will

00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:54,880
also update all of these modules if

00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,560
there's a security update you know we

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,060
try to make a panel of monopolies

00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,100
release on the same day that a security

00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:02,530
update comes out we also try to take

00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,630
care to select the correct versions of

00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:06,760
the modules so they work together there

00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:09,250
can be some interesting interactions for

00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,930
example between media and WYSIWYG and we

00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,940
take care of all of that for you so if

00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:15,580
you're using monopoly you no longer have

00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,710
to worry about managing this set of

00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:21,630
really popular modules you just update

00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,630
monopoly will take care of that for you

00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,790
layouts so every website has to deal

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,770
with layouts somehow usually an

00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:33,190
individual site has a couple of layouts

00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:34,810
you know three or four the traditional

00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,400
way in Drupal to do layouts is through

00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,290
the theme system but there's a plethora

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,980
of other ways you can you know use

00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:44,080
context and beans you can use panels

00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:47,700
Dena Polly uses panels and through

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:50,530
panels we provide this set of layouts

00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,720
they're all responsive they're all cross

00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:55,750
browser tested the work and most themes

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:59,110
and the user can switch between the

00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:00,679
layouts arbitrarily and move pieces of

00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,720
content between them

00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:04,730
in real-time on the page they're looking

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:11,570
at always a big style and I'll show you

00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:15,980
that right now so this is a fresh

00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:17,690
install of panoply 1.6 when you're

00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,749
installing panoply you get the option to

00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:22,429
install the demo data and that's where

00:20:20,749 --> 00:20:24,830
all of these vegetable pictures and this

00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:26,840
initial content is coming from if you

00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,399
disable that module later it'll remove

00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:33,619
all of that content so there's really no

00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:50,480
risk and enabling it hang on I have to

00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:52,009
log in right yeah so that the demo

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,399
content is provided by a module called

00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:56,690
panoply demo and during install it will

00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:59,059
ask you if you want to enable it and

00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:01,369
it's just a checkbox so you don't have

00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:02,990
to but if you do once you uninstall it

00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:04,100
it'll remove all this extra content so

00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:07,340
you don't have to worry about it adding

00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:09,470
junk to your site so these two buttons

00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,999
down at the bottom this customize this

00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,519
page and change this layout buttons are

00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:17,419
from the panel's IPE

00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:18,950
let's try changing this layout this is

00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:24,590
the current layout selected let's switch

00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:26,269
that to sidebar on the left BAM so now

00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:28,220
the the front page has a sidebar on the

00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:33,740
Left rather than on the right this page

00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:36,649
is already live done let's try clicking

00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:39,049
customize this page and here we can grab

00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:41,299
individual pieces of content on the page

00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:43,600
and move them around so we can take this

00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:47,059
content demo item move it to the sidebar

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:50,059
you'll notice over here this image got

00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:54,590
smaller it resizes to the amount of

00:21:50,059 --> 00:22:02,470
available space it has and if we click

00:21:54,590 --> 00:22:02,470
Save BAM this page is now live yeah

00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:19,359
hmm

00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,640
hmm

00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,540
no but I can answer the question right

00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:39,360
now so so the question was the when the

00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:40,890
image resizes like that is it just

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,720
resizing in CSS or is it actually

00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:45,750
resizing it on the server it's basically

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,540
the question yeah so we do use an image

00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:50,910
style to reduce them so we won't have

00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:52,530
like a gigantic image we have sort of a

00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:55,050
maximum size that the image style

00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:57,450
outputs and then after that it resizes

00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:59,790
it in CSS we do not have real responsive

00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:01,650
images we are talking about integrating

00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:03,420
the picture module which is a back port

00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,770
from Drupal 8 which does do responsive

00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,320
images but we we haven't gotten to that

00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:09,720
yet there is a feature in the WYSIWYG

00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,240
where if you resize the image in the

00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,160
WYSIWYG it will create a resized version

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,320
on the server and serve that but just

00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:22,050
not for the general output of images

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:25,440
everywhere else yes absolutely yeah that

00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:28,190
I was about to show so here we'll do it

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,190
we'll do it straight away

00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,280
so you can see here we reduce the width

00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:42,700
a little bit and already you can see

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,500
some changes the menu items become big

00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:47,050
finger push buttons this is probably

00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,030
like a tablet size you can also see that

00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,290
the images in the content also got

00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:54,400
smaller to deal with the amount

00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:58,030
available space that they have if we

00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:01,240
reduce it even further you'll see the

00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:04,690
menu go behind this hamburger icon there

00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,790
and the content switched to a single

00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:10,090
column layout so this would be the full

00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:11,740
mobile version the layouts are all

00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:13,810
responsive all the ones that come with

00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,880
panoply are the theme that we bundle is

00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:18,310
responsive Bartek which is actually a

00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:22,470
back part of the Drupal eight Bartik

00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:25,470
theme which is fully responsive so yeah

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,470
yes

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:40,710
mmm-hmm like really specifically so in

00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:42,570
panoply right now we have a custom grid

00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:44,160
system that does this we're in the

00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:46,110
process of switching to a set of

00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,930
identical layouts called radix layouts

00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:50,520
which use the bootstrap grid system but

00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:53,480
that's that's coming soon not quite yet

00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:57,630
Oh question over here

00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,700
how soon so you can already use radix

00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,830
layouts which will replace the panoply

00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,090
layouts with identical ones that use the

00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:06,180
bootstrap grid system

00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:11,600
we just haven't removed ours and bundled

00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:11,600
it in in the core distribution yeah

00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:19,649
hmm

00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:37,460
so so the question was if you want to

00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:39,860
have more stuff happen when responding

00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,330
such as different pieces of content

00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,650
disappearing or turning into an

00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:45,680
accordion or whatever how would you

00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:47,330
accomplish that and I think the answer

00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,740
is just the standard sort of Drupal

00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:51,140
answer there's a lot of ways to do that

00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,150
and what we're doing certainly wouldn't

00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:55,010
prevent you from doing anything you

00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:57,140
otherwise could do in Drupal if you want

00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:58,070
to do it at the theme layer you totally

00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,480
could

00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,490
you know replacing the templates and

00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,640
injecting the classes I think there

00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:06,440
might be some like panels plugins that

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,970
allow you to say that this pain will

00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,860
disappear when the screen gets below a

00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:13,090
certain size but we don't do anything

00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:15,410
that will hurt or help you doing that

00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:24,850
beyond you know what you can do a normal

00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:24,850
triple yes mm-hmm

00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:33,590
right so you don't have to give your

00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,300
users access to all of the layouts

00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:37,160
if you chose for your site to your

00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:40,610
distribution just to support a subset of

00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,840
layouts you totally could yeah if you

00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,890
wanted that level of control I guess

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,710
that would be that would be the way to

00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:48,170
go the layouts come from a module called

00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:49,940
panoply theme which really just provides

00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:51,140
those layouts so if you didn't want them

00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,000
at all and just like address that

00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,620
problem yourself you would disable that

00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:02,210
module or not included in your

00:26:54,620 --> 00:27:04,570
distribution back to the slides for a

00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:04,570
moment

00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:15,169
so search the core Drupal search is

00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:17,510
designed to run on as many platforms as

00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:19,010
possible including like $5 a month

00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:21,200
hosting it's not designed to be

00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:24,380
particularly feature 'full or performing

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,820
so panoply replaces the built-in drupal

00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:28,519
search with a suite of modules called

00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:31,429
search api which out of the box gives

00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:34,549
you a faceted search you can see on the

00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:36,590
right sidebar the filter by type and

00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:38,809
also allows you to easily swap out the

00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:40,490
search back-end for Apache Solr

00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:42,470
which is a real search engine if you had

00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:45,380
big search needs yeah like like I keep

00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:47,539
saying if you didn't want the search

00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:50,389
customizations that we do you could just

00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:52,840
disable this module and do your own

00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:55,789
thing right or in your own distribution

00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:58,789
all of our modules come with their own

00:27:55,789 --> 00:28:01,309
make file so if you didn't include

00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:03,169
panoply search in your distributions

00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:04,669
make file it wouldn't even download the

00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:06,289
dependencies for it it wouldn't pull in

00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:08,090
search api and all of that junk so you

00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:10,240
can slim it down to just the things you

00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,240
need

00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:17,600
WYSIWYG so whether or not WYSIWYG is

00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:20,529
actually a good idea and there's a lot

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:24,320
of valid arguments on both sides of that

00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:26,899
users love it some users expect it and

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:30,710
it's going to be in core in Drupal 8 so

00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:33,919
panoply does provide a WYSIWYG

00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:35,779
configuration in Drupal 7

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,730
you know just turning on WYSIWYG is

00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:40,340
actually quite easy like just getting

00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:43,519
the WYSIWYG editor to appear but in

00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:46,130
practice there's a plethora of problems

00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:48,320
that appear the first one is you know

00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:50,779
which of those buttons in the toolbar to

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,130
include turning on the buttons in the

00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:53,480
toolbar is super easy there's like a

00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,639
hundred options you just check a check

00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,580
box for each of them but some of them

00:28:55,639 --> 00:29:00,529
are a terrible idea

00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:02,480
for example letting them change the font

00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:05,120
you know they'll put everything in Comic

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,620
Sans destroy you know the all the time

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,639
you put in to perfectly selecting the

00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,340
fonts for your site

00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:12,710
yeah or letting them change the font

00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,840
size you know they'll make one line be

00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:17,269
fifty point and another line be fifty

00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,799
two point there'll be no consistency in

00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:20,450
any way you don't want them you know

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,640
changing font size for headers you want

00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,270
the

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,730
you know using semantic headers anyway

00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:28,950
so carefully selecting which buttons to

00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:31,650
include is difficult but just removing

00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:33,450
the button doesn't make it impossible to

00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:35,220
put that content into the WYSIWYG if

00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:37,440
they copied something from another web

00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,420
page or from word it will put it in the

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,280
WYSIWYG editor even if the buttons not

00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:44,460
available so you also have to set up

00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:46,050
filtering rules to remove the things

00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:48,480
that you don't want to be in there and

00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:50,670
then beyond filtering for control you

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,070
also have to filter for security there's

00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:55,110
a number of tags namely the iframe tag

00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:57,360
and the script tag that attackers could

00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:59,510
put in there to spy on your users or

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,430
steal their personal information and

00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:04,200
even beyond that you know some of the

00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:06,090
features that users expect in WYSIWYG

00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,830
don't come with WYSIWYG out of the box

00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:09,480
so you need to install additional Drupal

00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:12,060
modules additional libraries to get that

00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,190
to work so even though turning it on is

00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:16,920
pretty simple really tuning it and

00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:18,390
getting it right is rather difficult so

00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,070
let me show you what the WYSIWYG

00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:22,970
configuration that we've set up in

00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,970
panoply looks like

00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:37,070
so the first thing is by default we just

00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:38,180
show these simple WYSIWYG buttons and

00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:40,490
you have to click this other button to

00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,930
see some of the more advanced options so

00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:48,020
we don't overwhelm the user with too

00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:50,240
many options let's look at media

00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:52,010
inserting images which is something that

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:58,670
WYSIWYG doesn't do out-of-the-box and is

00:30:52,010 --> 00:31:00,470
relatively difficult to get set up yes

00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:05,080
we use the media module we use a very

00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:07,730
specific check out from the 2x branch

00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,710
and we try as much as possible to keep

00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:12,860
updating it as new versions come out but

00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:15,440
that is problematic for everyone but the

00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,700
version that we bundle is well tested so

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,550
you don't have to worry about dealing

00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:21,740
with media's bugs we have a couple of

00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:24,770
patches applied we have a extensive

00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:27,980
b-hat test suite that does test media to

00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:32,510
a certain degree so using our media will

00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:39,440
be less work to be stable than going

00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:42,260
your own a feature we just added

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,680
recently being able to manually crop

00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:49,670
things so you just wanted the kittens

00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:55,030
super-cute face that's from the manual

00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:55,030
crop module but let's not show that

00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:04,500
and you're able to choose an image style

00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:09,680
before you insert whether you want the

00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:13,350
original image or quarter size and

00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:15,840
returning to an earlier question if you

00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:18,270
resize the image here we have the image

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:22,710
resize module enabled so it will

00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:26,660
generate it on the server side if you

00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:29,010
have images you'll need image captions

00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:40,110
another extension to WYSIWYG that we

00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:43,130
include whoa my computer just turned off

00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:43,130
hold on a moment

00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:56,100
what's that yeah I used up my battery

00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,840
too much before coming to this

00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:01,040
presentation I'm sorry guys I'll get

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,040
this back online in a moment

00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:18,150
okay.what while we are waiting are there

00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:18,150
any additional questions sure mm-hmm

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,020
it's definitely on on the roadmap I

00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:26,530
don't know who was able to tell but that

00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:28,230
was tiny MCE we have a patch in the

00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:30,850
issue queue for switching to ckeditor

00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:33,730
it's something that we would like to do

00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:36,179
to get in line with Drupal 8 and to

00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:39,190
allow you to use the edit module it's uh

00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:49,960
from spark allowing you to edit fields

00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:52,539
in line yes mm-hmm so in in the empanada

00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,520
out-of-the-box I'll repeat the question

00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:55,780
the question was about SEO tools in

00:33:54,520 --> 00:34:00,010
panoply out of the box

00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:02,470
we don't bundle any SEO tools but there

00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:04,179
is a panoply SEO module which is

00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:08,409
maintained by the community which

00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:09,970
includes meta tags and a couple of

00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:12,879
others I can't recall off the top of my

00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:14,200
head but there is an add-on module for

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:17,950
that and it's actually provided as an

00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:19,510
app which you can like go into the app

00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:22,050
section on panoply and just say I want

00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:22,050
to install that

00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:40,500
any other questions sure

00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:48,690
so the steps the question was about how

00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:50,940
is it different to upgrade to

00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:52,470
distribution the steps are a little bit

00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,059
different for upgrading a distribution

00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:55,319
than you would with just like your own

00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:57,329
site with a collection of modules

00:34:55,319 --> 00:34:59,400
actually it's a lot like updating Drupal

00:34:57,329 --> 00:35:01,950
core you can basically follow the same

00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,140
instructions you would for going from

00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:06,150
like seven point two seven to seven

00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:09,150
point two eight with panoply the thing

00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:11,280
that you should not do is try to update

00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:13,859
the modules that panoply provides

00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,780
individually because we do keep them at

00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:17,910
very specific versions that are tested

00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:20,819
to work together and so if you update

00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:23,460
something it could break things but we

00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:24,950
do very regularly update what we have

00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,930
and test it make sure everything works

00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:32,430
and for security releases we will update

00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:35,940
as soon as possible the modules will be

00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:37,380
under profiles panoply modules so there

00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:41,010
being a physically different place which

00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,520
makes it a little easier I'm really

00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,619
sorry guys

00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,280
I should have plugged this in as soon as

00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:46,280
I got up here

00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,329
any other questions yes

00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:20,360
yeah so i'm a member of the drupal

00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:22,010
security team and my main goal of being

00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,480
a member of the drupal security team is

00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:25,820
to keep tabs on the security issues that

00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,830
affect panoply so we know about them

00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:30,560
before everyone else does which allows

00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:33,140
us to have our release ready for the

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,880
same day that the security issues come

00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:37,310
out I can't guarantee that we will

00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,860
always do that but we try really really

00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:41,630
hard and since we've started operating

00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:44,800
that way we have released on the same

00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,800
day as all the security issues

00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:05,980
in an unrelated question what desktop

00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:07,690
environment using an ocean it's a fork

00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:15,670
of ion allows you to do everything

00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:17,860
without touching the mouse see what

00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:21,210
loads faster LibreOffice with my local

00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,210
copy or Google Docs

00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:34,940
hmm yes for your custom work you would

00:37:32,569 --> 00:37:36,770
still put any custom modules or custom

00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:38,359
themes and decides all themes or the

00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:41,839
specific site directory if you worked

00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:44,119
that way we only bundle one additional

00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:46,099
theme responsive Bartok there are a

00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:48,619
number of themes designed specifically

00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:53,000
for panoply kala theme that the column

00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:58,250
owner guys created and radix Jobin

00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:00,770
atrium uses radix ra di X and those are

00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:09,619
based themes to allow you to create your

00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:11,599
own theme for panoply know the question

00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:14,119
was does it only work on on Pantheon um

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:17,150
and it'll work everywhere I'm personally

00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:19,010
not affiliated with Pantheon uh the lead

00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:20,630
maintainer Matt Chaney is also a founder

00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:23,569
of Pantheon and the names are sort of

00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:30,230
similar right but there is no dependency

00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:36,140
between panoply and Pantheon yeah in use

00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:37,250
for the OpenShift site or you mean it

00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:41,270
runs on OpenShift

00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:44,290
yeah yeah there's a cartridge to run

00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:44,290
panoply on OpenShift

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,480
okay sorry for the massive delay let's

00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,480
catch up to where we left off

00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:18,329
I think we're still looking at features

00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:18,329
of WYSIWYG all right oh come on computer

00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:27,490
I'm super sorry guys we'll end up having

00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,890
to to cut off probably the end of the

00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:33,160
demo once I finally get going again but

00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:34,480
if you have any additional questions who

00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,480
want to see more come talk to me we're

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,730
also doing a sprint a panoply sprint on

00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,820
Friday if you want to help out anyone

00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:43,990
can help even if you're not a developer

00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:47,020
you know just coming and testing and

00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:49,329
reporting bugs is super useful writing

00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:51,099
documentation is a new user also super

00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:53,670
useful I can never look at panoply as a

00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:57,690
new user ever again

00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:57,690
so please come join us

00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:17,360
okay maybe I'll move on to a later slide

00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:21,410
and come back to the live demo once my

00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:26,240
VM starts oh geez

00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:29,860
but all those slides kind of depend any

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,860
other questions possibly yes

00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,260
mhmmm

00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:06,090
mm-hmm so so the question was about the

00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:08,550
workbench module working with panoply

00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:11,970
and I guess like configuring the panel's

00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:14,490
part of a page yeah I think that might

00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:16,710
be more of a feature that will need to

00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:18,600
be integrated into panelizer I don't

00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:20,520
think it creates revisions for the

00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:23,340
changes that you make to an individual

00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,810
page I don't know we don't have any

00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:27,420
plans to work on that that's a really

00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:29,990
interesting problem though are you doing

00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:32,700
an internal distribution or a public one

00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:34,590
okay yeah I know that there's been a

00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:37,410
bunch of work by the open atrium team to

00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:39,870
make a workbench work well with open

00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:42,570
atrium which is based on panoply so it

00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:44,190
should work but yeah there is there is

00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:45,900
currently no way to connect their

00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:52,110
content revisions with the revisions

00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:53,370
you're making in the IPE oh really you

00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:58,320
should report the bugs to the issue

00:41:53,370 --> 00:42:01,280
queue Oh awesome awesome and come to the

00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,280
sprint and help us fix them

00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:26,440
okay there's one more feature I want to

00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:28,060
look at the WYSIWYG and then we'll look

00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:30,130
at the content editing experience the

00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:33,250
more details about managing the layout

00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:36,369
sorry again for the for the technical

00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:38,170
problems so another module that we

00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:40,810
bundle additionally with WYSIWYG is the

00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:42,700
linkit module a number of users have

00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:44,800
trouble with links and URLs like they

00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:48,040
don't even know what they are so with

00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,260
link it you can just type some keywords

00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:52,390
in a piece of content on the site it'll

00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:54,220
give you a couple of options you just

00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:56,020
select it and insert the link so the

00:42:54,220 --> 00:43:01,359
users never have to deal with URLs for

00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:03,609
the local site so yeah basically you

00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:05,170
know why create your own WYSIWYG

00:43:03,609 --> 00:43:07,240
configuration from scratch when you can

00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:08,800
take ours which we've already put a ton

00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,839
of thought into what to include and how

00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:15,520
to configure it so let's take a look at

00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:18,790
the content editing experience I will

00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:26,589
take a look at a new node so who here

00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:28,839
has our sure yes yeah so the question

00:43:26,589 --> 00:43:31,240
was about the admin menu and yeah we are

00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:33,160
using a back port of Drupal 8 toolbar

00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:35,020
menu which is called navbar in Drupal 7

00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,730
so there's sort of a theme of we're

00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,770
trying to use a lot of the stuff in

00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:41,530
Drupal 8 which we won't really be able

00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:43,119
to use Drupal 8 for another year or two

00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:47,319
so you get to enjoy some of the

00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:51,010
improvements in Drupal 8 in panoply so

00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:55,240
who here has seen the default Drupal 7

00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:57,280
add content page okay so there's a

00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,260
couple of people who haven't seen it and

00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,290
I'm due to the running out of time

00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:04,240
otherwise I'd show it to you but we've

00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:09,130
made a number of customizations to the

00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:11,470
content add page first of all we we put

00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:12,970
it in two columns the way Drupal 8 will

00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:15,730
also be putting the content add page

00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:18,700
into two columns we've removed some

00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:20,290
confusing and useless stuff from this

00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:22,690
page trying to get it down to the bare

00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:24,670
minimum that is necessary for example we

00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:27,010
don't have the promote to front page

00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:29,770
check box under publishing options

00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:30,490
because that check box only actually

00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:32,890
does something

00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:35,170
if you don't replace the default front

00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:36,670
page but everybody replaces the default

00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:38,410
front page so

00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:40,180
now all of you users at the end of time

00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:43,990
are stuck with a check box that does

00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:46,119
nothing right we also installed the save

00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:47,920
as draft module to get rid of the

00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:51,160
published check box now users have this

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:53,500
publish and save as draft button we've

00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:55,510
also put a lot of thought into changing

00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:58,210
the size and order of things based on

00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:59,950
importance so the title is big and at

00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:02,470
the top of the page like a title should

00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:04,030
be below it you have you know the URL

00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:06,640
that the page is supposed to live at

00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:10,680
which is also important but we make it

00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,680
super tiny so it doesn't get in your way

00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:19,210
so that's content you know Drupal does

00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:21,609
awesome at content like if you want to

00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:22,780
create a content type add a bunch of

00:45:21,609 --> 00:45:24,369
fields and then create a hundred

00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:26,140
instances of it that's Drupal's

00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:28,000
bread-and-butter right like if we made a

00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:30,220
presentation content type had a

00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,170
description had a link to the slides

00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:33,910
date and time that the presentation took

00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:35,890
place create a bazillion of them and

00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:38,049
make some views like Drupal rocks at

00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:41,380
that what Drupal does less good at is

00:45:38,049 --> 00:45:43,079
unique one-off landing pages and there's

00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:46,660
a couple of solutions to that in

00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:47,260
contribute X and beans panels is one of

00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:50,260
the solutions

00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:52,599
the problem with even panels is that to

00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:54,790
do that to create a landing page you

00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:56,319
have to use the page manager and the

00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:58,240
golden rule is users should not touch

00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:02,920
the page manager it's too confusing

00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:05,890
so in panoply you can go to the add

00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:07,690
content page and select landing page

00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:10,150
this isn't a real content type it's sort

00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:12,160
of like a pseudo content type but users

00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:14,349
are already used to the flow of going to

00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,849
add content to create contents that also

00:46:14,349 --> 00:46:17,849
come here to create landing pages and

00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,770
underneath this is actually creating a

00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,720
page manager page but rather than taking

00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:30,880
us to the page manager it takes us

00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:34,440
straight to the page view we will then

00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,440
customize it with the IPE

00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:44,059
actually first let's give this page a

00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:44,059
layout

00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:55,540
give it a sidebar everybody loves a

00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:57,730
sidebar and when you go to customize

00:46:55,540 --> 00:47:00,430
this page and click the Add button you

00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:01,869
get a menu of things that you can add to

00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:04,480
the page and they're all basic just

00:47:01,869 --> 00:47:06,579
internet things like add links add file

00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,950
add image you know there's there's

00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:11,079
probably a million ways in Drupal to add

00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:13,420
an image to just one page on the site

00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:15,220
and they're all really complicated right

00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:18,190
like you could do it with blocks but

00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:20,050
you'd go like admin structure blocks add

00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:21,339
your block you'll put it in one of the

00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:22,750
regions you don't really know what those

00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:24,700
regions are you just have the names

00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:26,140
right you put it in the region you set

00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:28,780
the visibility settings it's only

00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:30,160
visible on this page click Save and who

00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:33,760
knows if it even worked right

00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:37,359
but with monopoly you just come here

00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:40,030
click Add image but we're gonna step it

00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:42,960
up we're gonna add a video and I would

00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:42,960
have had this link ready

00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:54,620
so this is again with the media module

00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:59,450
you can put in either the URL or the

00:47:54,620 --> 00:48:01,280
embed code and as soon as you make a

00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:03,020
change in the settings on the left you

00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,440
see an immediate preview on the right

00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:08,950
any of the changes we make so add a

00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:14,090
title the title immediately appears

00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:15,650
let's make it a link to Google I'm

00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:19,570
hovering over the link you can see it's

00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:21,620
already well let me put HTTP on there

00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:23,950
you can see it's already a link to

00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:23,950
Google

00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:33,109
and we already have a video live you may

00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:36,109
have noticed I had checked to make that

00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:38,359
a reusable pane now we can come back

00:48:36,109 --> 00:48:42,319
here and see this reusable content tab

00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:44,180
and I can click Add and have that same

00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:46,280
video so this isn't a tool really for

00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:48,410
you for site builders this is a tool for

00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:51,020
your users they can create you know you

00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:52,970
reusable pieces of content that then

00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:56,410
they can use in several places on their

00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:56,410
site there a question

00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:09,370
yeah yes the question was about where is

00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:10,630
the reusable content available is it

00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:21,220
just on the page or on the whole site

00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:23,530
and the answer is on the whole site so

00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:25,300
the response the videos are responsive I

00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:26,860
think we're just doing it in CSS though

00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:39,550
so if I put it in the sidebar you'll see

00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:41,020
the video gets smaller yeah yeah yes the

00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:46,420
question was how two blocks work with

00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:48,610
this you can use blocks in panels and I

00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:50,200
personally also use blocks to do the the

00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,220
header and the footer but you don't have

00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,860
to do that does that answer your

00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:55,090
question we can talk about it more

00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,400
afterwards I want to try and get through

00:49:55,090 --> 00:50:08,680
more of this before I run out of time

00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:12,340
yes so they're not blocks they're

00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:15,040
they're pains from the panel's world but

00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:16,960
yeah when you say like make reusable and

00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:22,810
give it a name then it is like a pain

00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:25,560
that you can reuse somewhere else it's

00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:30,060
actually I don't want a video let's do a

00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:30,060
carousel everybody loves a carousel

00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:39,620
we'll make it the cutest carousel ever

00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:48,640
so you can see as I'm creating this

00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:56,260
carousel it's already appearing up here

00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:57,100
in the preview area what are you

00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:00,160
complaining about

00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:09,790
ooh we found a bug during a live demo

00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:12,040
surprise one kitten is cute enough let's

00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:15,070
add a content list to the sidebar so

00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:16,960
this widget is actually a view who here

00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:19,210
is used views before is familiar with

00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,710
creating views awesome so if you're a

00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:22,960
site builder and you haven't used views

00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:25,540
go learn it it's like the number one

00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:28,480
Drupal module it's useful for a million

00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:29,890
different things so this one's provided

00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,240
as a view and a lot of the settings you

00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:33,760
see on the left are actually view

00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:35,770
settings like we can say let's switch

00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:38,680
from being fields to content and now we

00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:41,800
see teasers or the full content or make

00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:45,610
it into a table we can control which of

00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:48,840
the views fields are displayed you can

00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:50,830
see it changing up here in real time and

00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,330
when you're creating the view you

00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:54,460
actually can say like which of these

00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:56,890
settings do you want to allow users to

00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:58,870
configure when adding it as a pain so

00:51:56,890 --> 00:52:00,520
you could say like well I still want

00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:02,200
them to be able to change like how many

00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,790
items are displayed but I don't want

00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:06,190
them to change the display type you can

00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:08,080
choose any of those view settings so you

00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:10,300
would be creating these views for your

00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,980
users for their specific use case and

00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:14,590
giving them whatever controls you wanted

00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:16,930
them to have actually this content type

00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:19,930
select box up here this is actually the

00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:22,090
exposed filter from the view so you can

00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:23,500
take any of the exposed filters on your

00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:25,060
view and say I want them to appear as

00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:27,190
paint settings or I want them to appear

00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:29,800
actually at the top of the widget like a

00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:31,780
normal expose filter so this allows you

00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:33,730
to create really powerful tools for your

00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:36,000
users that are specific to their use

00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:36,000
case

00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:44,030
so yeah after a couple of minutes we

00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:45,890
have something that you know sort of

00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:48,950
already looks like a front page right

00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:50,720
not a very good front page but we were

00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:58,730
able to very quickly put that together

00:52:50,720 --> 00:53:01,099
so another thing you're able to do is to

00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:03,290
provide your users with a menu of styles

00:53:01,099 --> 00:53:06,349
to apply to these widgets if you click

00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:07,970
the little paintbrush guy here you get

00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,950
the available styles these three are

00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:13,250
provided by the panoply demo module they

00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:16,130
all look terrible and we can make it be

00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:17,300
blue light blue lime-green that's

00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:20,060
probably the most terrible we can make

00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:22,460
that look but these are things that you

00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:24,170
create for your users you can create

00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:26,180
them in your theme you can create them

00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:27,710
in a module there's a module called

00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:30,320
stylize err that allows you to create

00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:33,829
these styles using a point-and-click

00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:36,109
interface and so you are able to give

00:53:33,829 --> 00:53:38,420
your users some control which they like

00:53:36,109 --> 00:53:45,230
but limit it to things that you know are

00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:46,910
going to look good so yeah like I was

00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:48,920
saying earlier the things that panoply

00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:50,630
provides our basic Internet stuff like

00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,900
it's a blank slate but if you're

00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:55,130
creating like a distribution for

00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:57,740
musicians you would add your own things

00:53:55,130 --> 00:54:00,050
here like a discography you know add

00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:02,300
album listing like you're able to

00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:05,440
customize this to be the type of

00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:05,440
experience you want to provide

00:54:13,829 --> 00:54:22,039
returned to the slides for a moment geez

00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:30,200
yeah so the most advanced use case of

00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:32,390
panoply is creating your own custom

00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:34,220
distribution and we won't be going into

00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:35,390
that today since this is more of a

00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:38,089
beginner session but if you're

00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:40,130
interested in it come talk to me or come

00:54:38,089 --> 00:54:42,560
to the the spinned on friday but we'll

00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:47,359
speak to it briefly right now you know

00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:49,250
panoply guides distribution development

00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:50,960
it provides a set of best practices for

00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:54,560
the low-level stuff like creating your

00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:57,560
make file you know how to structure your

00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:59,690
modules how to build your features how

00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,970
to create your custom things and

00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:03,650
integrate them into the same

00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:06,829
customization platform that monopoly is

00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:10,010
using this slide is sort of a thought

00:55:06,829 --> 00:55:13,190
exercise for the more experienced site

00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:16,190
builders here this distribution is open

00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:17,300
Academy which is built on panoply but

00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:20,180
let's pretend for the moment that it

00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:21,950
isn't right so this distribution allows

00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:25,430
Department websites to list you know

00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:28,369
what courses are available news events

00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:31,839
and it provides this view this course

00:55:28,369 --> 00:55:36,560
view if this were a normal Drupal site

00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:38,510
with this view how and the user wanted

00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:40,339
to customize it how would they add some

00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:45,800
text you know up here between the course

00:55:40,339 --> 00:55:48,710
title and the actual listing yeah so

00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:51,730
you'd go into views edit it create a

00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:55,339
header area and put the text there right

00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:57,140
that assumes that the user who's using

00:55:55,339 --> 00:55:59,240
this knows that this is a view first of

00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:01,700
all right and then it assumes that they

00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:04,160
know how to find where to edit views and

00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:06,020
add that header area right and that's

00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:08,240
that's workable you know you could train

00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:10,220
your customers up enough or your users

00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:12,650
on how to use views to do that but like

00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:14,869
what if they want to add a video here

00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:16,369
right like show some video their

00:56:14,869 --> 00:56:19,280
students smiling you know come take our

00:56:16,369 --> 00:56:21,109
courses you know it's accelerates to a

00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,180
point where you know it's difficult to

00:56:21,109 --> 00:56:26,510
explain to them how to do that in the

00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:29,000
panoply model which open academy

00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:31,190
actually does instead of creating views

00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,170
pages you would create all of your views

00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:36,560
as content panes and place them on a

00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:37,910
panel so then for people to extend it

00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,500
like all of that stuff comes from

00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:41,390
panoply they just come here

00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,830
the customize page throw some text in

00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:45,170
there throw a video in there you know

00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:47,600
remove some of the fields so it allows

00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:49,910
them to customize the changes that you

00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:54,470
create for them within the same sort of

00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:56,840
WYSIWYG model so here's some

00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:58,220
distributions built on panoply we talked

00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,630
about a number of them earlier demo

00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:01,730
framework actually only uses like a

00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:04,760
module or two from panoply but that's

00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:06,710
totally valid use Open Church for

00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:08,750
building Church websites restaurant for

00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:11,270
creating restaurant websites push tape

00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:14,870
for musicians MVP creators a pet project

00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:16,730
of mine these last two are really

00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:20,060
interesting examples there are both

00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:21,860
internal distributions I don't know like

00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:24,140
if web experience toolkit would be

00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:26,870
useful to you not being the Canadian

00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:28,820
government right but it's really cool

00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:30,560
that they open-source their code to let

00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:35,240
us see you know how they went about

00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:38,630
creating an internal distribution quick

00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:41,720
shoutouts Matt Chaney is the original

00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:44,780
creator of panoply and co-founder of

00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:48,140
Pantheon systems Tom Kirkpatrick

00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:51,380
co-founder of system seed you know we're

00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:53,150
the maintainer x' right but a lot of the

00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:54,710
credit goes to the panoply community we

00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:56,690
have a really active community on the

00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:58,550
issue queue our job is really to review

00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:03,230
and commit the stuff that everyone else

00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:06,020
is creating yeah so please join us on

00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:07,580
Friday for the sprint if you can sort

00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:11,230
again for rushing through the end of

00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:13,580
that and all the technical problems oh

00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:17,810
and I'm supposed to tell you to evaluate

00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:22,430
my presentation on the Austin Drupal con

00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:25,750
website please be kind and we have time

00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:25,750
maybe for like one more question

00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:41,859
mm-hmm so there are right the question

00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:44,290
was about panoply apps and there are a

00:58:41,859 --> 00:58:46,119
couple of apps available it's not a very

00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:48,430
developed ecosystem we'd like to develop

00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:51,090
it more actually I'd intended to call on

00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:51,090
someone over here

00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:05,259
mm-hmm so when panoply was originally

00:59:03,249 --> 00:59:07,799
when it was originally being created

00:59:05,259 --> 00:59:11,349
there wasn't WYSIWYG in Drupal 8 yet and

00:59:07,799 --> 00:59:14,559
tiny MCE was used and still is used by

00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:15,969
wordpress so the initial WYSIWYG was

00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:18,670
modeled after the experience that

00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:21,190
WordPress gave since they do have a very

00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:24,119
good content creation experience ok

00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:24,119
