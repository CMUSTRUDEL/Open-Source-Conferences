Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: FROM CONTENT STRATEGY TO DRUPAL SITE BUILDING - CONNECTING THE DOTS
Publication date: 2014-06-04
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: ronald_istos
Content strategy is, undoubtedly, a hot topic these days. A lot is being said that spans the range from concerns regarding the ability to display content on any device to the ability to drive engagement and increase traffic through better content creation and social media strategies. In this presentation we will connect the dots between these issues and practical Drupal site-building concerns with tools that are readily available now.

We will show, through specific examples and references to available modules, how different approaches to content strategy can be practically implemented on Drupal sites. The aim is to equip Drupal site-builders with a handy toolkit that will allow them to both implement a content strategy for their sites as well as better exchange information with content strategists.

The examples will include:
- Different approaches to building content types so as to empower content creators to create a range of different structures.
- Best practices in using vocabularies (fixed, open, user-generated, moderated, etc) or where alternative categorization methods may be relevant.
- Building menus and navigation.

We will also discuss:
- Editorial calendars and scheduling.
- The true benefit of workflows (and how, sometimes, they can be a disadvantage).
- Analytics and how the ability to measure the effects of any strategy is as important as defining the strategy itself.

Attendees will go away with practical examples and techniques that they can apply to their sites as well as a better understanding of what content strategy really is and how they can use it to improve their sites.

The examples are a result of our own experiences in helping both clients develop their content strategy as well as applying it on italymagazine.com, an in-house product of ours. We grew italymagazine.com to a relevant online digital brand with a strong community by expressing our content strategy ideas through the tools that Drupal 7 made available to us. The resulting ~250% increase in traffic over 3 months is a testament to both the value of a content strategy as well as the power of Drupal to allow you to flexibly and iteratively support it.

obligatory no presentation start up

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,389
exercises raise of hands how many of you

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:17,400
call yourselves we're done just raised

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:23,460
his hand how many of you call yourselves

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:25,080
drupal site builders okay cool how many

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:33,780
of you call yourselves content

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:36,899
strategist wow so this talk is is mostly

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,309
for the site builders if you're a drupal

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,559
site builder you'll hopefully learn a

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,469
bit more about content strategy and how

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,690
content strategists think if you're a

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,370
Content strategist hopefully you'll

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,129
learn a bit more about how Google site

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:53,149
builders think and you know how you can

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:58,170
talk to them and explain what you need I

00:00:53,149 --> 00:01:01,800
am actually neither which is might be a

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,589
problem you'll let me know what I do is

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:09,450
an SMS ETO blue spark and blue spark

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:12,409
does kind of sites for large

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:17,250
organizations you know multiple

00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:20,250
stakeholders universities and we are

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,990
also a bit weird because we spent a lot

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,869
of time don't just do consulting for

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:28,080
other people we spend a lot of time

00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:30,659
building our own products so one of them

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,829
is room if I if you're into travel

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:38,040
bookings you need to check this out and

00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:42,180
the other one is Italy and Italy is an

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:46,229
online digital brand I live in Italy so

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:50,090
it kind of works out and I'm going to be

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:54,049
using Italy as the example in a lot of

00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:58,560
things I'm going to be talking about

00:01:54,049 --> 00:02:02,549
okay so the first thing is defining

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,920
content strategy and there is if you

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,799
look it up online there is all sorts of

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,310
different definitions the way I like to

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,300
think of it is content strategy is

00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:15,720
adapting your content

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:20,100
to the context and I have an elaborate

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:23,040
example to illustrate this so the

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:26,550
example is Austin right so we're in

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:32,370
Austin and blue spark comes along to

00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:35,850
allston that's blue spark or there you

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,770
go that's blue spark and you know we

00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:41,850
want to say we're blue spark in Austin

00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:44,520
though it's a different context so take

00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:53,310
that away change our trying to figure

00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:59,340
out how this works hold on that's a bit

00:02:53,310 --> 00:03:02,160
better right that is blue spark in

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:07,320
Austin adopting your content to your

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:10,380
strategy but I'm just going to take a

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,500
break here because there was a huge much

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,570
better intro to this and my remote thing

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,700
didn't make it work so you're going to

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,700
bear with me because this is important

00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:25,670
that's blue spark you see the effect

00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:36,450
that's blue spark in Austin okay thank

00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:41,209
you no more effects I promise it's all

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:44,239
going to be serious now not really okay

00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:46,470
so content strategy has been becoming

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,020
increasingly more important for people

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,000
you know it's been growing and you hear

00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,100
more and more about it and people

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,360
calling themselves content strategist

00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:59,820
and so on and one of the main reasons is

00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:04,590
this right smart phones smart phones

00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:07,440
have been the thing that made the need

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,660
for content strategy very evident

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,459
because you could literally see your

00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,340
content in a completely different

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:16,859
context and it was very obvious that

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:22,080
very often it doesn't adapt to that

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:25,720
context but content strategy isn't just

00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:28,300
about you know smart phones

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:32,500
and how many of you have heard mobile

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:36,760
first right everyone likes mobile first

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:39,490
I have an issue with mobile first um I

00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,530
think it's you know sure mobile first

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,450
but a few years from now it's going to

00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:46,090
what is it going to be glass first you

00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:49,720
know adapt it to your glass is it going

00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:52,210
to be self-drive car first really what

00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,280
it is is content everywhere right you

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,340
need your content to show up in whatever

00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:00,430
context it's going to be and do that

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:02,830
properly so mobile first is great it's a

00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,680
great way of thinking about it but it's

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:11,530
not you know the Vandal and Bill of

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:14,440
content strategy this is a great

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:17,320
definition of what content strategy can

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,510
can really be the practice of

00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,610
understanding what content is needed to

00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:24,340
meet both users needs and organizational

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:27,250
goals producing it and creating

00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:31,210
realistic publishing and governance

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:37,720
plans to keep it that way and that's a

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:42,190
great book content everywhere so if

00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:45,460
you're interested check it out now the

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:48,100
problem with that is there is a lot

00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,660
going on you know in order to put all of

00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,120
them together you have to work with

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,060
information architects user experience

00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,760
this content management is editorial

00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:01,150
management their site building you have

00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:04,120
to tire of this to business goals so one

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:09,070
of the challenges is that the content

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:12,310
manager is kind of all the things we

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:14,229
love this in blue spark like this is one

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:20,800
of our favorite we need to do all the

00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:25,300
things so you know another way to think

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:28,990
about what content strategy is is think

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,520
about what it does to your side to your

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,370
business you know what does success look

00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:37,419
like what does it mean I've done it

00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:39,010
properly and this is a great list that

00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:39,470
I've kind of put together from a number

00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,960
of different

00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,880
sources so the first thing as we're

00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,700
talking about before content is not

00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:50,030
bound to a page right it's flexible its

00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:54,350
future ready we can provide the content

00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:57,830
the best chance it stands to satisfy

00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:03,170
what the user will need finding using

00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:06,350
the sharing is easy the message and

00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:08,510
editorial vision are clear and that's

00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:11,300
you know that's that's complicated you

00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,800
have to think about who you are and what

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:17,390
do you want to say and how do you want

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:20,780
to say you actually have to help content

00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:22,550
creators know so that they can focus and

00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:28,520
enjoy the process and not fight with

00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:31,370
their CMS and we need to know it works

00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,560
because we measured it as opposed to you

00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:39,560
know we we think it works and I'm going

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:42,860
to be talking a bit more about that so

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:46,280
that's content strategy wats Drupal site

00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:49,400
building and okay this is the Drupal

00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,500
site building track a lot of your drupal

00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,650
site builders so i realize this may

00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:59,180
sound to perfuse but there's a point to

00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:01,340
this actually one on drupal.org and roof

00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,020
of the Lord says Drupal site building is

00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:08,080
implementing business functionality and

00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:11,990
features into your Drupal site just that

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,140
it's you know thinking of the structure

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:17,120
and creating the content types

00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:20,840
vocabularies views panels menus you're

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,850
going to need and really you know what

00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,919
we end up doing is kind of figuring out

00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:27,440
of all of this thousands of

00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:31,430
possibilities on drupal.org in terms of

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,620
modules what is that ideal magical set

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:38,940
of modules that's going to build the

00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:41,490
perfect site for us so what

00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:45,120
drupal look like with content strategy

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:47,490
as i said i live in italy this is the

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,640
italian equivalent of drupal it's

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:54,990
everywhere it's everything to everyone

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:58,860
right and you know people use it in lots

00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:00,630
of different ways so that's drupal with

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,730
your content strategy you kind of figure

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:06,450
out how is it going to carry your

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:10,290
content from point A to point B and the

00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:12,510
choices you make are very important it's

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:15,930
going to influence you know what sort of

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:18,630
content you can put into it and you only

00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:22,860
you can I guess try to go for a certain

00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:28,260
demographic or you can make choices you

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:33,930
will regret so you know we have to think

00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:36,390
this through and this is this I think is

00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:38,550
is very important and I know a lot of

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:42,180
Drupal site builders are feeling me

00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:44,040
right now you have all this other people

00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,760
you know your content strategist and

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,750
your user experience experts and your

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,060
information architects and your

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,670
designers and the business people and

00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,410
they talk and talk and they say this is

00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,590
what we need this is what we have to do

00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:03,330
any kind of shows up and it's okay build

00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:05,460
it and the truthful site builder is the

00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:09,150
person that's actually going to build

00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:10,740
this that means taking any number of

00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,920
decisions that will never actually

00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:17,310
follow so the Drupal site builder is

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,050
really kind of an unrecognized architect

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:22,080
mainly maybe we should do that maybe we

00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,970
should you know petition drupal.org to

00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,339
take away the world site builder and

00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:29,130
replace it with architect because that's

00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:31,589
really what site builders are they make

00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,330
all sorts of decisions about how all

00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:36,690
this stuff is going to be implemented

00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:39,330
and they have to do that in a way that's

00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:47,000
going to support the needs of today and

00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:47,000
you know the needs going forward oh yeah

00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:56,970
so yeah content strategy and drupal site

00:10:54,239 --> 00:11:03,540
building together can be quite intense

00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:10,610
but it's a lot of fun you know I'll stop

00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:14,519
now okay so what's the first thing a

00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:17,759
Drupal site builder what's the first

00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:21,839
thing they they need to do it's modeling

00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:24,389
the world in Drupal and and I think this

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,249
is this is really the strength of Drupal

00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:28,470
and this is the part that you know

00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:30,689
Drupal site builders need to think a lot

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,279
about what are their tools for modeling

00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:35,579
the world this is what they're really

00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:38,189
doing their architects and this is what

00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:41,540
content strategists need to understand

00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:45,869
in order to speak to site builders and

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:49,649
the reason I'm here kind of took talking

00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:57,470
about Drupal is is because of the

00:11:49,649 --> 00:12:01,649
strength of its modeling tools so was

00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:03,629
think 2006 and I've been working on

00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:06,480
Italy as I mentioned there the website

00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:11,699
for about a year it was a complete mess

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:14,009
of 10 wordpress blog don't ask me why

00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:17,459
there was ten different wordpress blogs

00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:20,490
there were two joomla sites in there

00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:23,009
doing specific things there was some

00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:28,019
custom script for property management

00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:31,230
and there was a vbulletin forum all for

00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:32,939
one site and the question was you know

00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:36,029
what do we do next this is clearly

00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:39,990
unsustainable we need to change it and

00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:43,110
he kind of got down to ruby on rails it

00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:45,959
was it was cool at the time and drupal

00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:48,449
and Ruby on Rails everyone was talking

00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:51,629
about it I mean if you wanted to be the

00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:54,360
hipster of 2005 you had to be doing

00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:56,920
ruby-on-rails say was I just so much

00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,110
wanted to do Ruben reigns

00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,420
but they had Drupal and Ruben was

00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:04,399
talking about nodes as this generic

00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:08,600
content type and fields that the

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:12,500
attached to nodes and taxonomies and

00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,839
vocabularies and in a previous life i

00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,300
was in academia and i was doing semantic

00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:19,760
web technologies so saying wow this is

00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:22,329
also this people are way ahead of the

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,220
curve here so we went with Drupal and

00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:29,959
it's that's that's Drupal strength

00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:31,490
modeling your kind of domain in it and

00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:36,380
it gives you all sorts of tools to do

00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:40,870
that now as you're modeling things you

00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:45,519
know it's a continuous game of balancing

00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:48,320
abstraction modularity and when it's

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:53,829
when it's done right it's a beautiful

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:56,420
thing when it's done differently it's

00:13:53,829 --> 00:14:03,319
it's still beautiful but it's just not

00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:05,690
that useful so and I was talking about

00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:09,019
this with some of my colleagues this

00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:12,560
morning there's actually no mathematical

00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:15,110
proof now coming from academia candid

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,079
inference logics and constantly trying

00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:22,040
to attain the world and just write that

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:24,260
perfect equation that proves what we

00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,910
wanted to do and there is there isn't

00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,889
anything like that there is no

00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:30,829
mathematical proof about what is a

00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:33,529
correct content type or the correct

00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:38,060
structure of the site so what you are

00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:40,940
not doing is depending on best practices

00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:44,060
core principles and I think what's very

00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:46,639
important in terms of kind of building

00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:50,569
that set of best practices is to focus

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:54,139
on a specific set of tools and learn to

00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:56,170
use those tools very well because if you

00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:59,389
just keep changing your tool set so

00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:01,899
change is healthy but if you keep doing

00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:04,459
it all the time you never have the time

00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:06,410
to actually develop a set of best

00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:08,270
practices and then the other thing

00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:11,300
that's very important is built

00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:13,100
prototypes test them break them build

00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,990
them again usually when we are

00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:19,190
discussing you know how should we build

00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:22,340
the site in Drupal blue spark will end

00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:25,460
up with two maybe three competing

00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,900
approaches and then someone's going to

00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:29,210
say okay I'm going to go away and build

00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,160
this and we'll see how it works and

00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:35,810
that's another place where drupal is

00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:41,540
great it's a great prototyping to me as

00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:43,610
you're building things please please

00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,790
keep in mind who you're building it for

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:51,050
and and and this is this is this is kind

00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:55,040
of always a tricky point there's how

00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:56,720
many of you use de Velde generate there

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,420
you go I mean it's kind of the lorem

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,000
ipsum all of Drupal and it's great right

00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,820
this is an actually lorem ipsum can be

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,730
great as well but at some point you have

00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:10,040
to step away from that and use the real

00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:11,990
content give it to the person that's

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,470
actually going to be producing this

00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:17,810
stuff and let them play with it and it's

00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,700
not necessarily that you're wrong and

00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,420
how you build the content type or

00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:25,280
whatever it's just that they will never

00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:28,040
have thought of all the things they need

00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:32,020
before they actually got the chance to

00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,020
use it and build something with it

00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:44,490
so Drupal as I said has a great set of

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,649
tools for model in the world and I'm

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,800
just going to quickly go through these

00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:53,130
things in in Drupal 6 it was just note

00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,140
nodes in Drupal 7 it's entities right

00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:57,589
and you really need to be thinking of

00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:03,870
your Drupal site as a set of entities

00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:07,199
with the associated fields and then

00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:10,230
everything else builds on top of that so

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,449
you have nodes comments files users and

00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:16,770
terms these are really all just entities

00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:19,650
and then the quicker you start thinking

00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:22,770
of things like that as opposed to just

00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:25,380
note and notre one thing and they can

00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:27,209
have fields and the others don't the the

00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:30,870
faster you would be able to build more

00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:34,170
complex models of of your domain in

00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:37,710
Drupal because you have this stuff that

00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:40,410
comes out of Drupal core and then we

00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:43,710
have another set of entities products

00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:47,910
profiles beans which is really turning

00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:50,910
blocks into entities and then you can

00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:55,140
actually build your own custom entities

00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:56,730
right and all this is your world and the

00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:02,540
fact and it's it's a great balance

00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:05,400
between abstraction and modularity

00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:07,200
because you can think of everything just

00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,480
as entities and fields and anything you

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,510
do at the entity and field level applies

00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:17,370
to everything else if you get into kind

00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:20,070
of some of their higher levels one more

00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:23,490
effect that's it so once you get into

00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:26,550
custom data structures that's that

00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:28,850
begins to be a problem right because the

00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:33,480
model of your world starts to break down

00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:37,640
it's no longer just entities and fields

00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:41,640
so be very wary of kind of thinking

00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:43,620
maybe directly in terms of my sequel

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,570
tables and their structure and so on

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,929
Drupal is supposed to take care of that

00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,350
and you have to think of the world the

00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:51,510
way to

00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:55,320
who views it so you don't fight you for

00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:59,850
you work with it right now once you have

00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:01,850
your world photo like this you can start

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:06,390
you know breaking that down and making

00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:08,700
models of the world and literally you

00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:12,840
don't I mean Drupal zebra is a great

00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:15,059
prototyping tool and you can go away and

00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,429
immediately do content types but it's

00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:19,470
worth initially to just break things

00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:21,870
down and say okay what is it that I'm

00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,909
going to be doing here so I'm going to

00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,710
be writing stories those stories might

00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:28,020
have a location they might have a topic

00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:30,240
there is an author what is that author

00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:34,289
is it actually a Drupal user do I want

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:36,390
that what fields am I going to have if i

00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:38,760
have an image is that just something

00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:41,280
that people upload and that's the end of

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,799
that image or is it something that I

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,900
need to take care of so it's another

00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:47,549
entity and it can have its own fields

00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,240
and its relationship to other things and

00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:52,919
it can be reused throughout the site and

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:57,360
then you can take advantage of all the

00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:59,970
tools that Drupal has to bring all this

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,340
stuff together right so when you're

00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:04,950
thinking feels you're thinking well what

00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:08,150
sort of fields is it just a numeric

00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:11,309
field do I need to have a widget like

00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:14,190
hierarchical select it's just a drop

00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:18,539
down is it the text area and it's all

00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:20,909
this decisions that are going to impact

00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:24,330
the behavior of your Drupal site and

00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:26,730
it's all these things that define what

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:29,010
the content strategists are then going

00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:32,700
to be able to do with that content right

00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:35,760
this decisions impact how and where you

00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:38,220
can display your content so you know

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,710
thinking of stuff like field collection

00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:44,250
so that you conceptually group things

00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:51,809
together and make them over a sub part

00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:54,750
of another entity I'm I'm not going to

00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:56,010
go through all this modules and so on i

00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,500
just put them up there and then i'll

00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:00,390
share the slides and you probably know

00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,460
quite a few of them maybe some you don't

00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,640
one of the great things is you know how

00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,200
many

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:09,170
any field modules that are out there

00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:13,170
then you have stuff like field group

00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:14,870
where you can decide how to group fields

00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:16,950
together in terms of the user interface

00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:19,370
feel collection which literally

00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:22,440
semantically kind of group them together

00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:26,010
any others there's all sorts of modules

00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:29,970
and this is this is the Drupal site

00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:32,610
builders job right to know how many

00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:37,640
things there are out there that can help

00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:37,640
them develop a site model their world

00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:50,220
then you have another tricky decision

00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:54,840
how many use custom text formats for

00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:56,790
their sites this is a very very powerful

00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:01,170
tool and it's you know it's not that

00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:03,750
many because you have this continuum

00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:07,320
between absolute freedom you know full

00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:10,500
HTML actually you know drupal even lets

00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:14,720
you do PHP but we we don't talk about

00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:17,370
that so you can have absolute freedom

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:21,270
you can have your absolute austerity

00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:24,000
it's like just text that's it or you can

00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:28,230
find some sort of balance between all of

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,510
this and it's it's very important to to

00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:33,810
think every time the text gets entered

00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:36,840
somewhere in the site to which level of

00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:39,810
flexibility are you going to allow that

00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:43,980
text to be I kind of entered in right

00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:47,370
and we'll talk a bit more about this in

00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:53,310
the example again some some useful

00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:56,580
modules are and we need to keep this in

00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:58,440
mind and its its its attention so on the

00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:00,600
one hand you have the the content

00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,880
strategist that needs to be able to do

00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:07,680
absolutely everything right so we break

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:10,370
everything down into discrete pieces of

00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:13,620
information than we can manipulate in

00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:15,450
wonderful ways and then you have the

00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:19,230
content creators that go

00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:23,820
to you know notes large ad and it oh my

00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:26,880
god there's like 50 fields here there is

00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,399
no easy answer there's lots of things

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,179
that one can do thinking of the user

00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:36,299
experience hiding things automating

00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:44,429
things but ultimately it's just finding

00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:47,010
that right balance okay so that's kind

00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:49,950
of in terms of building your content

00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:53,039
types and defining you know what pieces

00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:55,889
make up your world another thing that's

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:58,440
quite interesting to to spend time

00:23:55,889 --> 00:24:00,409
thinking about is what are the different

00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,149
ways you can categorize continent

00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:05,490
obviously vocabularies and taxonomies

00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:08,010
are one of them but it's actually quite

00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:10,440
a few variations within that and it

00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:14,669
begins even before vocabularies you know

00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:17,309
you can have stuff like just simple list

00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:19,769
and they have their benefits of time

00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:24,840
it's limited choice it can't be changed

00:24:19,769 --> 00:24:27,450
easily but it ensures consistency and

00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,610
for a few limited cases it makes a lot

00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:32,940
of sense so kind of step through those

00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:35,279
options and always do advantages

00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,710
disadvantages discussion to figure out

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:41,580
you know what makes sense so you can go

00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:43,590
from list to tags and this is using

00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:47,190
vocabularies and this will be you know

00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:50,519
open-ended and this is great because

00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:52,380
it's very simple but it does mean you

00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:54,929
can end up with thousands and thousands

00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,429
of tags and you need some strategy in

00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:59,970
terms of how you're going to manage all

00:24:56,429 --> 00:25:02,850
this and again we'll talk a bit more

00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:05,039
about this then you have fixed

00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:08,399
vocabularies that are great they give

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:12,330
you fine-grained control you can also

00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:16,169
introduce fields to taxonomy terms and

00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:17,580
that's extremely useful but then you

00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:19,380
also have other things you know

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:22,519
categorization is not just about

00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:26,570
vocabularies you can use flags to allow

00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:28,130
content editors users whoever to build

00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:30,680
lists or

00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:33,500
things maybe that's what makes sense

00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:37,580
it's kind of think you know think of the

00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:41,540
options even organic groups in a way is

00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:43,880
a way to categorize content because you

00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,860
can group content based on a certain set

00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,650
of permissions they should have organic

00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:51,560
groups let lets you define what users

00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:53,720
can create within a group you can group

00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:58,100
it for community to say this is the

00:25:53,720 --> 00:26:01,310
content that this group of people did so

00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:08,750
it's it's yet another tool to model the

00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:11,030
world in Drupal and I think maybe of all

00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:13,100
the kind of different tools tools for

00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:15,500
taxonomy are really important especially

00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:18,260
for large site you know you want to

00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:20,090
periodically if you have tags clean

00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,790
things up so something like taxonomy

00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:27,710
merge that just lets you bunch things

00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:30,130
together it's very useful taxonomy tool

00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:35,780
provides a whole series of useful things

00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:38,860
go check that out and don't forget it's

00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:41,720
not just about people feed the machines

00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:44,480
that's that's how i got into content

00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,160
strategy it's thinking about how can I

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,890
break the content up so that I can

00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:51,290
annotate it annotate it and feed it to

00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:53,750
the machines and again Drupal is is

00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:57,710
great for this so you have rdf a kind of

00:26:53,750 --> 00:27:04,250
incorp there is support for facebook

00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:08,420
graph or schema.org and so on okay that

00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:12,080
said modeling Italy than if you can see

00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:15,140
that so that's fine we have all these

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,510
tools to to model the world what are we

00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:19,160
going to do about it and how we're going

00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:21,050
to use it so I just wanted to step

00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,890
through a practical example and just

00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:28,070
show you you know how we went about

00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:32,060
implementing content strategy in for

00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:34,100
Italy now the first thing we did was

00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:37,250
actually you know because this is a site

00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:39,500
that had years and years of content we

00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:41,440
did a Content audit trying to figure out

00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,120
what are the things that work

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,320
what are the things that don't work and

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:50,649
it's slow and it's boring and it's

00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:54,129
painful but it's extremely useful right

00:27:50,649 --> 00:27:55,990
because it gives you a sense of where

00:27:54,129 --> 00:27:57,730
you are now how much do you have what

00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:04,570
what makes sense what can you throw away

00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:07,240
and so on so after our audit we spend a

00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:10,269
lot of time talking about you know what

00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:13,389
do we want to achieve as Italy what do

00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:15,250
our users want to achieve building user

00:28:13,389 --> 00:28:16,870
profiles and I'm not going to go into

00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,490
the detail of that this is kind of

00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:22,600
forward to preside building rather than

00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:25,659
content strategy but this this exercises

00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,639
are extremely useful because they

00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:30,820
obviously they give you the definition

00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:32,649
of what you need right too so once you

00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:34,659
do all of this and you have a sense of

00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:36,940
where you are and where you want to go

00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:40,570
you can start thinking okay how do I

00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:45,370
need to model my content in order to get

00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:48,100
me where I needed to be and you start

00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:52,090
doing content models this is literally

00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:54,909
kind of one of the early drafts of the

00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:57,909
content model for Italy magazine and I

00:28:54,909 --> 00:29:06,629
will spare you the details it was very

00:28:57,909 --> 00:29:10,210
exciting convey the the main issue is

00:29:06,629 --> 00:29:14,169
thinking of content both in terms of

00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:16,259
content categories or someone I heard

00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:21,250
yesterday said you know types of types

00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:23,049
so you have in it on Italy magazine we

00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:26,980
have stuff like editorial those are

00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:29,710
stories that journalists right we have

00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:33,309
resources these are things that are in a

00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:36,009
way much more evergreen recipes language

00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:39,789
lessons and so on we have listings that

00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:41,409
actually advertisers generate and then

00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:44,919
we have things that the community

00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:49,899
generate right so this gives us a way to

00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:52,240
group the different types of types and

00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:54,370
treat it in different ways and then

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:59,440
think of you know how them

00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:59,440
the navigation is going to reflect that

00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:05,990
something that I was extremely important

00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:11,750
for Italy is you know the the objective

00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:13,460
is to model Italy now Italy has model

00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:15,140
Italy for people who are interested to

00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:18,260
go to Italy for holidays and kind of

00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:19,510
enjoy Italy if we're going to model

00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:24,530
Italy let's say from the political

00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:26,510
perspective I would quit so yeah from

00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:31,610
the lifestyle perspective it's awesome

00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:35,200
so you have things like culture and food

00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:39,380
and drink and art and everything is

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:41,330
essentially based on two main axis one

00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:43,760
is location you know where is the thing

00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:46,550
you're talking about and the other one

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,770
is the big cross section is this about

00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:52,100
culture is this about art it's about

00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:56,480
food and drink then you have subtopics

00:30:52,100 --> 00:31:00,110
so it could be things like I know sports

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,970
or fashion or property and so on and

00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:04,070
then you have tags and tags are

00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:06,680
open-ended and one of the things we

00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:10,190
needed to do with tags is sit down with

00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:13,520
the content creators and discuss what

00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:15,650
are the rules in terms of how tags gets

00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,660
created and know when do you create ads

00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:20,930
because we'd have all sorts of weird

00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:22,580
things and essentially in the end we got

00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:26,660
down to something like you know its

00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:31,880
people its events it's kind of big items

00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:35,450
like that so once you have your

00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,950
different content types and you have

00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:40,190
your vocabularies that tie all these

00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:43,430
things together you dive into building

00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:45,980
the sketching out the details of this

00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:48,800
and one of the more interesting ones is

00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:51,710
recipes because recipes and it's kind of

00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:54,230
the content strategy example because

00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:56,270
it's both complicated and easy to

00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:58,730
explain because everyone knows that

00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:02,870
recipes has a list of ingredients and it

00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:06,260
has a time and a difficulty and what's

00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:07,860
what's interesting here is thinking of

00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:10,200
the structure of your

00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:12,530
type in a way that's going to open up

00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:17,429
possibilities for you so for example

00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:20,520
what I have there is a field collection

00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:23,940
to enter the ingredient and the quantity

00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:26,730
right and this is an open-ended

00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:30,170
vocabulary so it's essentially tags but

00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:33,990
just for recipes so every time a new

00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:36,120
ingredient gets added to the system we

00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:37,770
have a page that says you know are you

00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,280
interested in cooking something with

00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:43,169
prosciutto or mozzarella or whatever you

00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:47,610
can go to that page and see all the

00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:50,040
recipes that have that from the content

00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:53,160
creators perspective it's relatively

00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:56,340
simple you know the main rule there is

00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:58,650
please try not to duplicate ingredients

00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:01,620
and there are tools and ways to make

00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:06,480
sure that that doesn't happen and you

00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:08,220
both get a breakdown of your content

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:13,020
into all sorts of different categories

00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:15,780
and you also have a way to to enter that

00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:17,910
and finally the other thing is because

00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:20,309
we're kind of pulling different things

00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:23,429
together you can see one recipe and see

00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:25,650
the related recipes and see things like

00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:30,710
cooking schools because all that falls

00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:30,710
under our food and drink cross-section

00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:41,970
there is there's an interesting cutoff

00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:45,150
point between you're creating content

00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:48,419
types for content creators that belong

00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:50,720
to your organization so you can get mean

00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:54,120
with them and say why didn't you do that

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:58,500
told you not to type just anything in

00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:00,870
there you know go fix it and users that

00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,380
you actually have to be nice to it's

00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,380
annoying

00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:11,860
but you know we didn't want to miss the

00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:14,409
chance on Italy magazine to not be able

00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:17,020
to categorize our content that gets

00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:20,770
generated by users so they approached

00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:23,050
and we're still developing exactly you

00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:25,720
know what's the best balance is to a

00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:29,770
make it very simple so they just have

00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:31,750
like simple text box they can enter the

00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:34,899
question they can just drag and drop

00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:38,800
images but then on the kind of the next

00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:40,840
page we say you know please help us out

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,640
here you're part of this community if

00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:45,429
you actually add a topic and you add a

00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,110
location it's going to be so much better

00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:48,700
for everyone because other people are

00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:50,409
going to be able to find your question

00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:52,630
and answer it and you're helping

00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:56,890
everyone out and that was extremely

00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:59,110
useful and it's surprising I think it's

00:34:56,890 --> 00:35:02,500
something like ninety percent of

00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:07,300
questions have topics and locations

00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:08,470
added to them i was i was literally

00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,630
expecting you know everyone to be

00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:18,540
jumping that page but you asked nicely

00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:22,390
and people respond so you do all that

00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:26,010
you do all that set up and then you can

00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:31,420
just sit back and enjoy the returns and

00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:33,940
that's kind of the this is when you

00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:37,750
start seeing that content strategy is

00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:40,540
working for you you there's a lot of

00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:42,130
upfront discussions a lot of debate you

00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:45,460
know how are we supposed to model our

00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:47,650
world how granular do we need to make it

00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:50,500
and so on but once you've done of that

00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:54,100
and you've implemented it then you can

00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:56,560
kind of enjoy the results and you know

00:35:54,100 --> 00:36:00,790
some of the things that we do in italy

00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:04,210
magazine is we generate streams of

00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:06,220
content dynamically based on rules

00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:08,170
because we have so many different ways

00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:11,050
of saying you know go get me something

00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:13,870
from property that is in this section of

00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:15,020
italy go maybe find the related recipe

00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,970
go find something for

00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:19,100
community and kind of put it all

00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:22,600
together and only two magazine we use

00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:26,420
node q to put the streams together and

00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:28,100
they can be updated both manually so an

00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:31,310
editor can go in and say you know it's

00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:35,150
very important that we have a specific

00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:38,230
story in a specific position but it can

00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:41,090
also be updated automatically so you can

00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:43,010
kind of look at how your statistics are

00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:49,990
doing and just go grab that content and

00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:53,990
put it in the right position we can

00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:56,630
because we have all this division and

00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:59,620
tagging and so on we can have an archive

00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:04,220
and we have content essentially from 99

00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:07,130
but really from let's say from 2005 it's

00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:09,860
much more structured so that's nine

00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:12,980
years of content there is a lot going on

00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:16,010
there and we we use solar in the back

00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:17,480
end to parallel searches and because

00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:20,210
there's such good integration between

00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:24,500
Drupal and solar we can build up all

00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:26,330
sorts of different archives of you know

00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:30,380
where content and people love it they

00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:32,810
use it a lot we can do things like you

00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:35,810
know just the recipes we've we spent the

00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:39,230
time to set up the content type for

00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:40,970
recipes to do all that all those fields

00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:43,550
and create the tags for the record for

00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:45,560
the ingredients and so on and now you

00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:51,710
can say you know okay I want sweets I

00:37:45,560 --> 00:38:01,640
want primis accounting zone we do

00:37:51,710 --> 00:38:04,190
location pages Italy has 8300 kind of

00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,620
different locations and those are just

00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:09,380
like the official ones and Italy

00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:14,030
magazine has a page for each one of

00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:17,750
those and we pull together content from

00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:19,760
across the site building essentially

00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:21,800
this mini sites where you know you go to

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,910
Sicily and you can see Sicilian recipes

00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,200
and properties and experiences and it's

00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:31,660
no effort

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:36,260
because the content strategy up front

00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:39,200
led us in this direction so this this is

00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:42,980
a kind of the things that are extremely

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:45,109
useful and why it makes sense to spend a

00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:47,210
lot of time to think about what you need

00:38:45,109 --> 00:38:49,329
upfront think about the ways you're

00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:53,030
going to describe it and let's say

00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:57,829
Sicily is actually a taxonomy term page

00:38:53,030 --> 00:39:02,119
right so it's it's just that cross

00:38:57,829 --> 00:39:04,940
section and we attached the fields to

00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:07,339
the taxonomy term because it's an entity

00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:10,940
and that works the same like everything

00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:13,130
else and then we went to Wikipedia with

00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:15,650
that term and said okay give me all the

00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:18,290
information like longitude latitude and

00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:21,380
so on and that's the the mapping info

00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:24,349
page there and got to put a screen shot

00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:28,030
in and that kind of you know brings that

00:39:24,349 --> 00:39:28,030
cross section of information together

00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:33,859
then we let with flags as I said it's

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,190
another way to categorize things we let

00:39:33,859 --> 00:39:40,880
our users create lists of stuff they

00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:42,890
like and for the time being it's you

00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:48,740
know I'm thinking of buying that I don't

00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:50,720
know yeah so yeah you can kind of have

00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:52,550
your users generate lists and then you

00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,400
can group all that together so you can

00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:57,680
do things like most favorite properties

00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:05,720
in Tuscany and you know all of that

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:10,190
stuff and of course you can feed the

00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:13,270
machines so right now we're working on a

00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:18,470
mobile app for the property section and

00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:23,710
it's it's kind of absurd how simple it

00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:28,069
is we're using titanium appcelerator and

00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:32,810
we're just providing you know Jason from

00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:34,410
the Drupal site putting that together

00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:37,970
it's

00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:42,480
there's a presentation before about

00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:44,849
building products in Drupal and startups

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,339
and it's kristef if anyone knows

00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:50,069
cristoffen something that kristef said

00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:54,180
struck me said it's amazing you know the

00:40:50,069 --> 00:40:56,940
amount of work and technology that goes

00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:59,640
into us being in this room watching this

00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,609
and it's it's very much like that you

00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:07,140
know we take certain things for granted

00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:11,940
but it's an extremely staggering level

00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:15,000
of complexity that comes together and

00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:19,260
lets us just do these things very simply

00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:22,680
as long as we take the time to think of

00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:25,260
the model of our world like our domain

00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,480
so everything else is taking care of us

00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:29,369
the tools are there it's all there we

00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:35,339
just need to spend the time to think of

00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:38,670
how we're going to model our world okay

00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:42,960
so I'm just going to talk briefly about

00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:44,460
producing and sharing content and the

00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:49,049
first thing I'm going to do which is a

00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:51,390
great shortcut is tell you that there's

00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:54,119
a great presentation Adrienne did which

00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:58,230
is our technical director on you know

00:41:54,119 --> 00:42:03,329
showing the author some love best

00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:06,270
session title ever right and this is

00:42:03,329 --> 00:42:09,270
just all the things you can do to make

00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:11,299
it easier for content creators well

00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:15,059
maybe not all the things a lot of things

00:42:11,299 --> 00:42:21,510
you can do to make it easier for content

00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:23,640
creators to create content now as I

00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:25,680
mentioned at the start content strategy

00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,359
is you know thinking about the

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,640
organizational goals thinking about the

00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:32,190
user goes thinking about the content you

00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:35,099
need to satisfy those goals it's also

00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:37,710
thinking about how you're going to send

00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:39,520
up content out into the world and it's

00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:42,280
also thinking

00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,650
out you know what what is that process

00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,710
was that workflow and the one thing I'm

00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:51,610
going to say about workflow is the less

00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:54,700
of it you need the better and challenge

00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:58,210
challenge your organization's about

00:42:54,700 --> 00:43:00,160
exactly why it has to go through five

00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:02,680
different people that have to take some

00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,220
box that are so busy busy that they're

00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:10,260
not actually going to read it and just

00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:14,170
think about how you can simplify your

00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:15,400
your work chrome and this I'm I can't

00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:18,640
believe I'm going to do this but I'm

00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:21,070
going to plug WordPress right here so

00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,740
that I suppose from years ago I watched

00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:25,540
this interview where you had trees and

00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:30,730
Matt all right and they were talking

00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:33,160
about WordPress and Drupal and I agree

00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:35,290
you know Drupal all the way right but

00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:39,340
there was one thing matt said which was

00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:42,130
actually quite interesting so they were

00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:44,320
asking about you know using content in

00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:47,350
large organizations and dress with

00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:49,090
Robles is saying Drupal is fantastic we

00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:53,320
have you know you can have any workflow

00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:55,000
you need what Matt said is when we go

00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,250
into organizations when we go into

00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,220
newspapers and they talk to us about

00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:03,280
workflow what we say is why do you need

00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:06,040
that workflow and I think that makes

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,560
sense and it may be that you actually do

00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:11,320
need that workflow but think about it

00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:14,710
you know ask that question don't just go

00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:21,670
ahead and implement a very complex state

00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:25,350
diagram that can does that then the

00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:31,300
other thing to do is study user behavior

00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:34,450
and this is if you're working how many

00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:36,760
are kind of creating content for in sort

00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:42,220
of a media setting like newspaper

00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:44,620
magazine and so on okay so you guys know

00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:46,510
what I'm talking about I think if you're

00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:49,660
if you're doing it internally in the

00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:50,920
organization it's slightly simpler but

00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:55,260
if you're doing it

00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:57,460
for users out there it's so much fun

00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,290
because you have to think of everything

00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:02,260
right you have to think how am I going

00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:06,369
to write this thing on Twitter so that

00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:08,559
it gets the right response and you know

00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:12,040
we're all in undated nowadays with stuff

00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:15,640
from buzzfeed and occupy or whatever

00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:17,079
that's called which is most amazing

00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:20,079
thing ever you won't believe what

00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:22,599
happened next and that's all you know it

00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,700
works for them that's studying user

00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:26,280
behavior and kind of figuring out what

00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,150
people are going to respond to

00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:32,440
unfortunately those things are you know

00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:34,599
lowest common denominator but it's and

00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,160
you don't need to do it that way but

00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:38,829
that's very important you have to think

00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,839
of you know when are your users online

00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:42,880
so that you actually tell them the thing

00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:46,839
you want to tell them prepare an

00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:49,059
editorial calendar it's it's kind of a

00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:51,760
shame that Drupal right now doesn't have

00:45:49,059 --> 00:45:54,430
an editorial calendar solution and

00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:57,369
that's something that hopefully we will

00:45:54,430 --> 00:46:00,130
be working on we were kind of thinking

00:45:57,369 --> 00:46:01,930
of how to structure that but having an

00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:03,730
editorial calendar having something that

00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:05,740
says these things are going to be

00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:07,690
published on this date these people are

00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:09,640
responsible this is how it's going to go

00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:12,819
out on social media and so on is

00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:15,280
extremely important on Italy where only

00:46:12,819 --> 00:46:19,000
you know like pushing out maybe I don't

00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:23,520
know 10 15 pieces of content a day of

00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:26,680
which seven are significant or maybe six

00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:30,250
being able to manage that is a task if

00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:33,099
you go to larger media outlets they're

00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:36,520
doing fifty sixty a hundred pieces of

00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:40,119
content a day putting all that into a

00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:41,770
calendar is extremely important as

00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:43,780
you're doing that with Drupal kind of

00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:47,349
from the technical side you have to

00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:50,079
think of how that's going to impact you

00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:52,599
know the way you you publish things so

00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:56,260
it may be that you know you have some

00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:59,619
caching in place that means that even

00:46:56,260 --> 00:47:01,900
though the continent eater hit save that

00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:03,280
thing is not actually visible or they

00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,960
changed it and they thought you know

00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,380
they had fixed the problem

00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:11,109
maybe they have the wrong title but

00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:13,030
caching didn't fix that and and it's

00:47:11,109 --> 00:47:15,010
actually pretty simple to fix these

00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:17,740
issues you just have to make sure you

00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:21,280
think about it and same thing with

00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:24,250
sharing tools they can be very annoying

00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,349
although they're very useful so you know

00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:31,750
stuff like Facebook likes and tweets and

00:47:26,349 --> 00:47:35,589
Pinterest and Instagram and I hate all

00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:45,730
this stuff by the way but it's extremely

00:47:35,589 --> 00:47:52,210
important and useful measure everything

00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:56,800
I so I love Monty Python and whenever I

00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:58,930
talk about you know why are we doing

00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,420
things it is the Spanish Inquisition and

00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:06,880
I wish I could bring some torture tools

00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:10,150
as well tell me why you know you have to

00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:12,730
ask the right questions anecdotal

00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:18,520
information is great but that's all it

00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:21,810
is use graphs and we the way we

00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:25,180
integrate a lot of additional

00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:28,480
information on Italy and so just to give

00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:32,349
you one example with your quizzes right

00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:36,940
this is something that our users love so

00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:39,520
this quiz is figuring out what pizza it

00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:46,150
is right so you see an image what pizza

00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:48,550
is that margarita well done and what we

00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:52,119
did and it was actually very painless is

00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:55,359
we integrated event tracking with google

00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:58,150
analytics so we literally know how many

00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:00,220
times people clicked on the various

00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:02,010
pizzas you know and how many got it

00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:05,200
right and how many call it wrong and

00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:08,200
this because you know this is all kind

00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:11,290
of a javascript thing so there's no page

00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:13,300
reloads and stuff like that but it gives

00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:15,820
you two things you can actually go back

00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:17,560
to whoever is controlling the budget for

00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:20,650
content creation

00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:23,290
say look this is the engagement for my

00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:25,690
quiz I built it in a way that you don't

00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:28,450
have page loads because that's better

00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:31,000
for users but I can still show you that

00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:34,030
there is engagement there is value in

00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,670
this and I'm not doing it just because

00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:40,600
someone said oh this is a great thing

00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:44,560
I'm going back to you with numbers right

00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:46,840
and proving that it's a great thing so

00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:49,390
as you're building everything together

00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:57,150
make sure you think of what are the

00:49:49,390 --> 00:50:01,410
things that you're going to measure now

00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:06,400
I'm just going to close by saying that

00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:09,970
you know content strategy is not kind of

00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:15,730
all there is to it and this is something

00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:18,760
that Rick sizzle that over there is is

00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:20,320
working on which is of engagement

00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:24,850
strategy kind of taking it one step

00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:29,710
higher and saying what are the things

00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:32,050
that are tie everything together you

00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:33,580
know as we go out and talk to users what

00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:35,530
are the channels we talk to them through

00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:37,750
what are the actions on the side that

00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:41,650
lead to goal is being achieved and so on

00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:44,170
so you're kind of you need to place your

00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:47,620
your content strategy within maybe a

00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:49,450
slightly higher level perspective of you

00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:52,720
know overall engagement so not just

00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:54,460
creating content but how you you engage

00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:57,390
people without content and where you

00:50:54,460 --> 00:51:00,040
engage them with that content and so on

00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:04,080
ok I think we're also almost up with

00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:04,080
time one more time

00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:09,569
thank you very much

00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:19,340
any questions

00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,520
either module is that the question was

00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:32,020
where can I get that module list I'll

00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:36,580
have the slides up as quickly as

00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:41,740
possible not today because we're having

00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:43,450
like a huge barbecue contest later so

00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:48,070
maybe not even tomorrow but as quickly

00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:50,880
as possible okay cool I think that's it

00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:50,880
