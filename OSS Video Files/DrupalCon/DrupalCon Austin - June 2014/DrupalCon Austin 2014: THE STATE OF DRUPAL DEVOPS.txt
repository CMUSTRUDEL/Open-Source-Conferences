Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: THE STATE OF DRUPAL DEVOPS
Publication date: 2014-06-03
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Please help support this session by taking the 2014 State of Drupal DevOps survey. You will have the thanks of the community for your time. You could also win an iPad. http://cyberswat.limequery.com/index.php/81259/lang-en The Survey runs until May 5th 2014. DevOps is a cultural conversation supported by technology. It is ambiguous and hard to define, but this has not stopped it from becoming the Golden Chalice for all things tech. For executives, it has become the ticket that solves their internal software management issues while keeping harmony between Stakeholder, Product, Sales, QA and Engineering. For developers, it gives them control of systems and better methods for integrating their work while protecting them from disgruntled decision makers. It gives operations the consistency and predictability to be able to support their systems while the rest of the organization makes decision after decision that affects them. I've heard DevOps enough to know that it is here to change the world, but what the hell is it, why should I care, and where does Drupal fit in? Perhaps Drupal's version of DevOps is represented in the host of quick start virtualization projects that exist for Developers. Or maybe it's mired in the debate between Waterfall, Agile and Kanban. Don't forget that DevOps just isn't the same without a few provisioners and orchestration mixed in. I must be DevOps if I can stack my Containers in a way that gives my Chef the ability to deliver exactly what the butler named Jenkins wants. Feeling confused yet? You are not alone. This session will help us understand what DevOps is and how it relates to the projects, management styles, and systems that our work touches. Armed with this knowledge, we will evaluate Drupal as a community to identify what is working, and what is not. We will address the fragmentation in this space and encourage a conversation that helps us move forward as a community. DevOps, when applied correctly, allows people to shift their focus from the technical challenge of delivering their message to the message itself. This is an important paradigm shift with profound implications ... let's discuss.

they don't have wireless mics for us so

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,700
I'll be basically doing a little bit of

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,340
podium hugging today I apologize in

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,070
advance I guess we can go ahead and get

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,750
started this is the state of Drupal

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,490
DevOps if you're in the wrong room

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:21,570
you're going to realize it really quick

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,949
a lot of people have all kinds of

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,660
interesting responses when they hear the

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,970
word DevOps some are good some are bad

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,410
some are confusion some are you're crazy

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,840
summer you don't know what you're

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,399
talking about and everything in between

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,739
the best one though is when the

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,780
operations people stand up and say I've

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,040
been doing this my entire life why are

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,270
you calling it something I've never

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,370
heard so it's a neat little balance this

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,550
is drupalcon austin if you were confused

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,920
about that I cannot help my name is

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,350
kevin bridges on the internets I'm kind

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,940
of known as cyber SWAT I director of

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,070
technology at a company called new media

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,590
Denver new media Denver is a very

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,180
interesting place we are specializing in

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,090
DevOps implementations we are

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,820
specializing in consulting management

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,380
workflow issues deployment issues things

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,659
that we have seen in the enterprise

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,350
repeatedly have been able to isolate and

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:17,159
help people with so let's get right into

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,080
it basically cyber SWAT does not mean

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,909
what you think that it does I know that

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,009
lots of people have neat connotations

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,770
that they associated with that but it's

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:28,470
not what you think I'm not a drupal

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,060
developer or a devops engineer that's

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,100
going to be shocking to a lot of people

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,380
I used to be quite good at Drupal I am

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,659
no longer quite good at Drupal but I can

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,340
help out with implementing it I can help

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,430
out with deploying it and I can make it

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,520
run really well I'm an open-source

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,340
technologist pure and simple DevOps is

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,470
not equivalent to open source so if you

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,790
walk into a DevOps conversation and you

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,619
think that somebody is going to

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,869
immediately start having the same

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,049
conversations that a typical open-source

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,310
developer will have you are wrong

00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:00,829
there's reasons for that I think a lot

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,299
of that has to do with the fact that

00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:06,270
DevOps kind of spring from the

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,759
enterprise and reality drupal knows

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,129
about DevOps specifically because we

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,710
have people that had to maintain our

00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:15,270
success so as developers we got

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,310
larger we were doing bigger sites

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,800
eventually those bigger sites started

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,110
working with more ingrained operations

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,390
teams those teams had to figure out what

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,160
this Drupal thing was they had to figure

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,110
out what memcache was they had to figure

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,490
out what a whole host of things were

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,200
that were specific to our environment

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:35,340
our code is not written very performant

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:40,950
tends to take a little bit more

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:42,570
resources to operate in most systems I'm

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,120
also the director of technology at new

00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,710
media Denver basically covered that as

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,840
far as drew polls concerned I've worked

00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:51,360
on some pretty interesting sites he

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,220
worked with a lot of really good people

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,930
along the way and was able to do a lot

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,310
of really neat things one of the first

00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,800
big ones I think for the Drupal

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,170
community in general was popular science

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,060
we launched that very early on it was a

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:06,360
one of the very first Drupal 6 sites

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,700
they hit the airwaves and it was well

00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,500
received we did some very extensive

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,090
write-ups about it really tried to use

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,580
open source to help people understand

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,770
how it we did what we did and what they

00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,810
needed to do to reproduce what we did

00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,970
and I think that's the first time that

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:24,110
anybody wrote a case study to that

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,310
magnitude or for that goal on drupal.org

00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,670
another site that I was heavily involved

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,500
in was examiner.com basically we

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,380
launched examiner.com a couple months

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,410
before Drupal 7 was released had a very

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,150
interesting team of people working on it

00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,730
some very talented individuals as well

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,690
we started introducing things like

00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:49,020
MongoDB at that time basically examiner

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,660
com is a top 50 website property in the

00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,250
United States it was a high traffic

00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,670
scenario it involved many servers many

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,170
people and a lot of organization

00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,790
basically became a release manager to a

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,220
certain point during that process to be

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,990
able to to start bridging that gap

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,030
between what we needed to do to keep the

00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,710
site running what we needed to do to get

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,960
our releases out there and and

00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:12,660
everything in between that also involved

00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:16,470
things like talking to a very focused

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,900
and very opinionated development team

00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,640
that very much had things that they were

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,190
accustomed to doing that needed to

00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,380
change to be able to grow so it was a

00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,150
combination of managing technical and

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,479
managing people and

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,720
two totally different things and then I

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:37,380
moved right into the top secret space

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,449
yeah that is a bit of a pain point for

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,509
me because I can't talk about what it is

00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:44,639
that I do as a result of that and I'm an

00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:47,310
open-source developer I didn't get in

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,680
this to be top secret I got in this

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,229
because I enjoy talking I enjoy teaching

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,900
I enjoy doing what I do and I'm doing it

00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:57,870
to make the world a better place when I

00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:01,560
have a top secret project it doesn't

00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:04,500
tend to necessarily align with all of

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,690
those like I think principles that I'm

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,250
looking for I've worked at SUNY

00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,889
companies along the way a company called

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:13,260
ping vision very early on definitely not

00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:15,000
the same company today worked at a

00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,800
company called bonheur corporation banya

00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,900
corporation it will two hundred and

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,229
fifty year old Swede Swedish company

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,750
basically help them set up a system as a

00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:26,370
result of doing pops I to migrate all

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,460
the rest of their magazines from

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,410
java-based CMS platforms over to Drupal

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,560
so lots of vignette lots of data

00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,910
migrations lots of repetitive work it

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,169
was a very interesting project to be

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,080
involved with met some really cool

00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:42,260
people there too ended up working for

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,020
another company called clarity digital

00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:48,120
people might or might not know who that

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:52,370
is but it's a large company as well and

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,659
then worked for ironically a hawk wheel

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,949
so I've also done some things with

00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:57,900
drupalcon I've served as the code of

00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:59,310
contract chair and a DevOps track chair

00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,250
for multiple Drupal cons I've been

00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:05,810
involved since drupalcon Denver on a

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:09,960
drupalcon level I am no longer involved

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:12,120
that that's a hard pace to maintain each

00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,830
project basically led me more into dev

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,440
ops and further and further from open

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,180
source and and again that's just a huge

00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,490
pain point for me I don't understand

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,680
that it just drives me crazy and we'll

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,080
get to that a little bit more I'm on my

00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,539
way back to open source and I'm bringing

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,220
DevOps with me so basically the intent

00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:30,780
of what I'm doing why I'm presenting

00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,130
this data why I'm standing up here and

00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,020
talking about DevOps even though

00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:36,840
everybody hates the word DevOps is

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,460
because it's a necessity somebody has to

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,740
do it we have to talk we have to

00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,569
communicate we have to

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:46,150
working together and if we're not then

00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:48,710
we're missing great opportunities so

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,360
mandatory we're hiring plug if anybody

00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,099
likes what I say if you don't like what

00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,979
I say if you can do what I'm saying

00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:56,780
better come talk to me please because I

00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:58,970
want to work with you if you can

00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,889
contribute to this conversation even if

00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,360
you're running another company come talk

00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:04,819
to me there's things that we can do

00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:08,720
together to make this whole system a

00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:10,130
better thing so this is going to be done

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,430
a little bit differently basically we're

00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,990
dealing with a lot of data so I'm going

00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,150
to do it the open-source way which is a

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:21,080
little bit different here's an example i

00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:23,389
sent an email to a gene kim joon kim is

00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,199
a very prolific blogger he works at

00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:28,520
puppet labs he wrote the Phoenix project

00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:29,810
which is an awesome book if you guys

00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,120
haven't read it if you need to

00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,099
understand the principles of DevOps go

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,110
out and buy that book basically what

00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:38,240
they do in that book is they equate what

00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,940
we do in the technology space what we

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,099
think is so new unique to old-school

00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:46,250
industry practices so they literally

00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:48,380
took a 1920s manual that talked about

00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:51,139
how to move a production line from point

00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,789
A to point B and how to find bottlenecks

00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,830
in that production line how to identify

00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:57,139
weak points and how to get your team to

00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,610
work together this is not rocket science

00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:00,680
this is stuff that the human race has

00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:03,469
been doing for a very long time they

00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,960
basically replaced a box with a computer

00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:08,780
and we wrote the book it's very

00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,030
interesting all of the data that i'm

00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,590
going to show you is up on this project

00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,750
page right now so if you go to

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,580
drupal.org project devops underscore

00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,349
survey you will be able to download the

00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,120
database it's a scrub database of all

00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:22,340
the respondents there's a PDF document

00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,889
that has a lot more data that's in the

00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,449
slide you will be able to dissect it and

00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:27,979
the data scientists in the room will be

00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:29,539
able to tell me everything that I did

00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:30,759
wrong with what I'm about to present and

00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:34,339
I look forward to that conversation

00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:37,099
please make use of this data on the goal

00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:39,110
is that we need to track metrics we need

00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:41,659
to be able to identify where we have

00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,370
come from what we are doing and where we

00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:45,140
are going and until we can do those

00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:49,550
three things as a community then we're

00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:51,050
just kind of lost another one this

00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,030
presentation if you don't like the way I

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,430
talk you can download this presentation

00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:57,880
from github com new media Denver /

00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:00,650
presentations it's already up and online

00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,020
everything that I do goes into the

00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:05,240
public space because our organization

00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:07,460
has identified that if you want to be

00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,860
truly successful you need to be able to

00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:12,020
separate what makes you you a unique

00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,760
snowflake and what the structural

00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:17,270
components are and you need to develop

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,460
workflows that help your engineers and

00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:22,580
your operations people and everybody in

00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:24,740
between become public facing figures if

00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,570
you're doing devops correctly if you're

00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,850
separating your data from your structure

00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,770
and you're not being forced into a

00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,660
business situation where you have to cut

00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,880
corners you have to keep that snowflake

00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:37,100
data then you're basically going to

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,780
instill a workflow where you have the

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,280
ability to get more efficient at what

00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,350
you're doing you're starting to work in

00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,900
very structured ways and it changes

00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,240
everything it's it's very slow at first

00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,700
it takes a little bit to get going but

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,490
it's worth the effort um basically think

00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,170
of it like Pilates right so the first

00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:56,060
time that you start doing Pilates or at

00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,950
least for me I thought it was just

00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,630
ridiculous couldn't move couldn't do

00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:02,750
anything I didn't know what the hell was

00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,920
going on ended up started doing it for a

00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,160
couple weeks stuck with it I'm a

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,540
stubborn person I don't quit very well

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,270
eventually it got to the point where it

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,070
started being okay wasn't totally

00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,750
comfortable with it but eventually I got

00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,370
to that point where it was like why

00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,440
haven't I been doing this my entire life

00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:20,690
I mean I'm losing weight i'm more active

00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,220
i'm thinking better this just makes no

00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:24,950
sense that i wasn't doing this thing

00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:27,140
before devops is that devops is very

00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,700
painful at first you have to understand

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,260
it you have to define it and then you

00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,510
have to look at yourself you have to do

00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,920
introspection you have to find out what

00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,600
your organization is what your

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,100
organization is trying to accomplish and

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,810
then you have to give it the right tools

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,850
the right workflow and the right

00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:43,010
methodologies to accomplish it if you're

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,620
not doing those in an open space then

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,210
you're recreating the wheel and your

00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,700
organization is investing a lot of money

00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:51,050
in you doing that so basically what ends

00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,690
up happening is the moment that you

00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,610
think that you're you're unique you're

00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:58,070
really not and you're spending a lot of

00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:00,020
money and you're not being as efficient

00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:03,170
as you could be it's a very interesting

00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:04,920
paradigm it it just starts to resonate

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:08,500
after

00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,850
so um again back to i'm going to say a

00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,760
lot of crazy things during this

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,710
presentation i expect people to tell me

00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,240
where I'm wrong I look forward to it

00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:19,180
because I know that everything that I'm

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,860
saying is likely wrong I'm only a person

00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,180
I'm just trying to figure this out I

00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,040
have a little bit of data that I've been

00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,320
able to collect to help make some points

00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:30,400
but show me where I mess up and let's

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:33,040
talk in room 10 be blink reaction this

00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:36,010
Thursday 1045 to 1145 I have off

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,620
scheduled there's some conversations

00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:41,320
that I want to engage in there so let's

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:44,860
get down to it what is DevOps survey

00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,900
says oh that one day id do this there's

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:50,680
a survey going on the same time from the

00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:52,570
devops people i have not entered that

00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,280
because i do have a lot of respect for

00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:57,090
DevOps but i had no idea what they were

00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:02,050
talking about I've no right like oh

00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:04,750
that's yeah so that's what Drupal thinks

00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:07,390
of DevOps basically through and through

00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:09,220
and it's an interesting paradigm because

00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,140
the people that can benefit the most

00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,030
from using DevOps are the people that

00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,850
have no idea what's going on with dev

00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:18,850
ops and the challenge that I've been

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:21,640
finding is that it's a very tactful and

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:24,880
and deliberate conversation to be able

00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:27,640
to have somebody understand number one

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,680
that they need devops number two how to

00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,600
do it and the number three how it can

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,330
impact them directly what tends to

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,580
happen it is something totally different

00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,680
but let's get back to the presentation

00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,620
what is DevOps we need to define that

00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,450
right I mean that's why we're here so

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:49,570
let's ask everybody that took the survey

00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:54,070
what is DevOps survey says what the

00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:58,930
was that so basically what that was was

00:12:54,070 --> 00:13:00,970
a devcloud our word cloud of everybody's

00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:02,350
response the people that claim to know

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,600
DevOps the people that claim to

00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:07,030
implement DevOps they can't even tell

00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,130
you what DevOps is because DevOps is not

00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:11,980
a thing it's a buzzword it's a marketing

00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:14,170
term it is designed to get you to think

00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,610
about what you're doing in a different

00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,740
way than what you're accustomed

00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:21,100
doing it's the same thing as agile all

00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:23,589
over again it's quite interesting most

00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,300
people throw devops around like it's

00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:27,310
just a thing i'm sure most of you have

00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,829
seen the devops in a box video if you

00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:33,100
haven't google for it it is phenomenal

00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:35,050
it is its people are making a joke of it

00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,880
now so they're their schools of thoughts

00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,440
that say I will not even consider your

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,720
company if you say that you're hiring a

00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,980
devops engineer I will not consider you

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,170
if you say that you are a DevOps

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,450
practitioner because you don't get it

00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:50,829
and I disagree with that but we'll get

00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:52,839
to that later so why are we here because

00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:56,130
we all need virtualized dev environments

00:13:52,839 --> 00:14:00,519
I read the session proposals for

00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:03,040
drupalcon many times it tends to be a

00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:05,410
natural first step for development shops

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,630
to want to virtualize their development

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:10,269
environments so here's typically how

00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:15,070
that that happens and in this tweet I

00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:19,180
just all oh my goodness um I'll slow

00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:21,040
down for a sec so this tweet is a very

00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,610
typical tweet from a very smart person

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,050
who I admire greatly he is trying to get

00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,880
started in Bay great development he's

00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,290
associated with Drupal he doesn't say

00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,899
that he wants to do drupal here he's

00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:35,620
just staying local David development so

00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:37,720
what immediately happens is you get all

00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:41,829
kinds of cool comments that are really

00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:45,940
helpful yeah again helpful and then you

00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:49,449
get some even more knowledgeable people

00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:51,130
in the virtualization space basically

00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:52,990
schlepping their their solution that

00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:56,350
they've been using for X amount of time

00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:58,149
without ever asking the original poster

00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,160
why you wanted to use vagrant in the

00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:02,680
first place or what he was trying to

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,160
accomplish from it or what his long-term

00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,240
vision was or anything like that so

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,220
immediately start getting

00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,820
recommendations oh that I should jump in

00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:14,230
and download this he's already starting

00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,240
to feel a little bit overwhelmed he

00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:19,449
needs a session a drupalcon I think

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,890
that's a great idea but what are we

00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:22,630
going to talk about I mean all that I've

00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,970
heard is vagrant and virtualization how

00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:27,420
does that apply to anything and it goes

00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:31,990
on and on you get you know

00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:33,339
yeah sorry about that but basically what

00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,839
ended up happening is there are a lot of

00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:35,980
good solutions out there there's a lot

00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:37,600
of people working on this problem

00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,339
because all of us are dealing with it

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,470
every single day if you're running a

00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:43,060
development shop I'm sure that and I

00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:45,100
have the data to back it up that you've

00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,050
realized that virtualization is becoming

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,790
a thing docker is going to come up

00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,170
pretty soon core OS is going to be

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:52,449
evolved there's a lot of neat stuff

00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,009
happening in this space right now people

00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:56,709
need to use this stuff but where do you

00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:58,360
start what do you do it's pretty

00:15:56,709 --> 00:16:02,829
interesting and basically what it leads

00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:05,860
to is eventually this complete and total

00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:07,629
option paralysis you have no idea what's

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,730
going on you think you're happy because

00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:11,139
you just learned a lot of stuff and in

00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:13,839
the end you're laying on the floor not

00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:16,329
doing anything um so it's pretty

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,089
interesting I don't know maybe I'm

00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:20,949
stretching i don't know but i don't

00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:23,110
think that i am so let's try it again

00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:26,319
why are we here maybe we'll get it right

00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:28,529
this time it's real simple we're here

00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:31,389
because of culture automation

00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:34,180
measurement and sharing those of you in

00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:36,730
the DevOps space know this is camps this

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:39,490
is the simplest definition that you will

00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:41,529
ever get doesn't even say DevOps

00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:44,439
anywhere doesn't even have those letters

00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:46,149
in it but this is everything that DevOps

00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:47,980
is this is everything that we accomplish

00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:50,110
through the agile movement through being

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:53,170
able to communicate more efficiently

00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:55,420
there's schools of thought that say that

00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:57,129
silos are bad but silos you know as

00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,319
Kevin Barrett said in a recent

00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:01,509
presentation have been around since the

00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:03,399
days of Plato get over it they're going

00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:05,380
to be an enterprise you need them to

00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:06,970
succeed in enterprise if you don't

00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,569
understand that then you're probably

00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:12,220
missing a couple of points so what does

00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:14,319
that bring us back to it brings us back

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,000
to sharing the enterprise's the

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,829
company's the organizations that are

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,010
capable of understanding what their

00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:23,140
snowflake business model is and what

00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:26,650
their structure is are the ones that are

00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:29,230
going to be successful so we still

00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:31,080
haven't really quite nailed down DevOps

00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:36,309
as it relates to the Drupal community

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:38,950
this is notorious in so many ways but

00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:40,160
basically for this story I'm going to

00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,170
tell you

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,950
basically just think of DevOps as

00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:47,450
bananas right pretty simple they're

00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,920
really sweet they're really good they're

00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:52,820
really nutritious they have a lot of

00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:57,410
value to certain types of people those

00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:59,690
types people tend to be monkeys these

00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,850
monkeys like their bananas a lot they

00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:04,520
basically find out eventually that in

00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:07,430
order to succeed in order to survive you

00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,740
need to be bananas because it's the only

00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,970
food on the island if you're eating your

00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,310
bananas you're able to do other work

00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,990
you're able to do other things

00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:17,270
eventually that monkey gets smart he's

00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,560
like man these bananas are good so I'm

00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,570
going to tell my friends about these

00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,370
bananas and these little monkeys are all

00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,900
starting to get together they're

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,580
starting to share their starting to talk

00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,190
they're like Hades bananas they're so

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,600
great I can do XY and z with them here

00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,730
let me show you how to do that and it

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,380
starts to grow it starts to spread but

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:36,440
what ends up happening along the way is

00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,940
monkey started getting bigger eventually

00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,090
you get a couple little gorillas in

00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,890
there so those gorillas now are pretty

00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:45,140
good at moving bananas around they're

00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:46,670
pretty adequate at what they do they

00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,190
understand the value in what they are

00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:51,080
doing so they're helping out more and

00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,940
more monkeys it's still a little

00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,370
innocuous it doesn't really mean

00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,110
anything right now it's just a couple

00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:59,420
monkeys helping each other but

00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:02,150
eventually Loki's turning to gorillas

00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,560
and at some point you have a couple of

00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:06,230
gorillas that are pretty dominant in

00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,910
space and what ends up happening in a

00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:10,040
scenario like this if you look at it

00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,960
very carefully you have a lot of monkeys

00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,210
that are pretty happy they're doing some

00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,480
pretty neat stuff they're impressive

00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:19,610
they are really working well together

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,640
but you have a couple of gorillas on top

00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:24,350
of it that are progressively hiding what

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,920
it is that is making these monkeys so

00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:29,570
good there in essence becoming a barrier

00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,790
to those bananas because they're

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:33,830
standing in the way they need more

00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:35,900
sustenance they need more fuel they need

00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:37,820
more everything so they're bigger

00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,860
they're larger they're meaner and

00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,510
basically what ends up happening is they

00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:44,030
stop you from getting to those bananas

00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:46,550
and you can't share them you can't talk

00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:48,620
about them because the perception is

00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,630
that those bananas are basically the

00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,870
business model so if I give you my

00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,760
business model how that

00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:57,270
how am I going to compete how am I going

00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:00,690
to you know pay my employees if I can't

00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:03,059
have something that's unique so let me

00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,400
ask you a question just kind of will go

00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:08,820
back to technology for a minute how many

00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,000
of you have installed Apache okay

00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,730
everybody in the room except for Jeff

00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,320
but that's cool because I know he has

00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:19,950
how many of you used a config file when

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:22,710
you install the patchy everybody in the

00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:25,170
room so basically the act of putting a

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:28,620
config file in place for Apache to read

00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:30,360
is not unique it's not there's a number

00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,400
of ways of accomplishing that so let's

00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,350
break that out let's say hey if you're

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,420
working with Apache guess what you're

00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,670
going to need a config file guess what

00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:41,130
it should probably look like this hey

00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:43,020
here's one step further I have tests

00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:45,929
that will support it I have tests that

00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:48,030
will work in XY and z these tests

00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:50,640
abstract what it is that I'm talking

00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:52,470
about and because we have slowed down

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,570
and broken cycles we're doing

00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:56,580
test-driven development now we have the

00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,830
ability to say in plain English what

00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,570
this thing does so the next time that

00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:02,880
lets say a business person comes along

00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:06,780
who knows nothing about technology they

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:09,720
can query your tests and get a clear

00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:12,510
plain english definition the Apache put

00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:15,030
that file in place and that files needed

00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:17,400
to configure apache done I know what the

00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:21,179
system does now why don't we have that

00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:23,010
for Drupal I mean seriously we all do

00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:25,890
the same stuff we use vagrant we use

00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:28,110
some of us use vagrant we use all kinds

00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:31,410
of caching technologies we use a PC we

00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:33,330
use PHP we use apache we use engine X we

00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,010
use all kinds of stuff and we tend to do

00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:39,210
it pretty consistently so why are we all

00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:41,340
reinventing the wheel gorilla attraction

00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,590
form silos plain and simple the nice

00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:46,050
thing about or the interesting thing

00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:48,179
about that particular silo is that those

00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,620
monkeys are so ingrained with supporting

00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:51,900
those gorillas that they will never be

00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:56,940
able to go anywhere else so it's

00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:59,190
effectively a trap it's unfortunate open

00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,960
source changes silos that's why I got

00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:03,570
involved with Drupal that's why I'm here

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,680
today not because I'm supporting silos

00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:07,540
but because I'm supporting open

00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:12,670
source it changes the world we need to

00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:14,830
start doing it so why a survey this is

00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:17,440
very interesting to me how many of you

00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:20,280
have heard of DevOps days a couple

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,020
people on DevOps days is a global

00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,640
conference much like drupalcon except

00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,800
that it happens more frequently it's

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,050
done on an open source model anybody can

00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,730
step up organize a quick event and it's

00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:32,290
kind of like drupal camps they're

00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,120
getting a lot of penetration this

00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:37,000
happens to be one of the organizers of

00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,100
DevOps days his name is Chris boys art

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,250
on this is him approximately two years

00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:44,230
ago Martin posted a post asking people

00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,610
what they thought about voting on Drupal

00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,710
concessions because there's this

00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,600
interesting stigma that it is almost

00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:51,010
impossible to present for a drupalcon

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,440
because you have to be one of those

00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:55,410
phenomenal rock stars to be able to do

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,970
anything and let me tell you right now

00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:59,830
my experience from doing the number of

00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:01,210
code reviews that I have and working

00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,830
with the teams that I have is that if

00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:06,070
you have somebody that is in your team

00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:09,550
that is a rock star then your code needs

00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:12,190
to be fixed plain and simple um there is

00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:15,220
no need for a rock star anywhere it's a

00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,660
code smell but this gentleman spent a

00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,250
little bit of time trying to penetrate

00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,430
the Drupal community he is now the

00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:24,490
DevOps chair for the European track and

00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:26,620
if you look real carefully at how North

00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,960
America and Europe are organizing the

00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,900
DevOps tracks it is intensely

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,970
interesting and by that I mean I believe

00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,250
that people like Chris came to the

00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:39,820
Drupal community because we made them we

00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:42,880
gave enterprising operations people

00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,800
tools that they needed to fix so they

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,630
had to learn about our stuff they had to

00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,220
introduce us to dev ops and they had to

00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:50,560
do what they needed to do to help

00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:53,170
elevate us as a community so that they

00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:56,980
could stay sane and I think it's our

00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:58,480
turn to reciprocate so let's just get

00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,970
right into the data I'd said my

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,800
craziness for the day I'm gonna let you

00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:05,110
guys reflect on that for a little while

00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:09,250
and I'm going to get into the data as

00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:11,140
much as I can so basically what we have

00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:14,440
and I'll just talk about where this data

00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:16,600
came from real quickly is a open source

00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,149
project called limesurvey it's an in XML

00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:22,899
format I sent Chris an email

00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:25,389
he sent me the xml format we have both

00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:28,960
versions on that drupal.org project page

00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:30,099
I would really love to see somebody pick

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,169
this up at some point in the future

00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:34,089
maybe use it in a future drupalcon or

00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:35,979
use it in their business or write

00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:37,419
presentations about it and tell us what

00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:38,799
it is that we're doing right and doing

00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:41,169
wrong and there's some very interesting

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,820
things that can be gleaned from this the

00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:44,440
first thing that we're seeing in between

00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,599
these two years is that we are

00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:50,139
experiencing consistent growth and site

00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:52,509
management and site-building it's it's

00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:54,940
pretty straightforward I mean these are

00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:56,409
who are you kind of questions these are

00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:59,859
the types of organizations that are

00:24:56,409 --> 00:25:01,899
growing right now we're also seeing

00:24:59,859 --> 00:25:03,789
across the board you know going back to

00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:05,889
this gorilla concept we're seeing a

00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:08,320
decrease in clients self hosting sites

00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:10,690
it's becoming more difficult for a

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,690
client to self host their site they have

00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:15,219
to run a host of technologies a lot of

00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:17,649
people don't have the bandwidth or the

00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:19,269
capacity to do it they're busy biting

00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:21,399
that Drupal cliff and trying to become

00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:27,129
rock stars so it's an interesting

00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:28,869
paradigm there's that word the number of

00:25:27,129 --> 00:25:30,820
people pulled into DevOps is on par with

00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:33,009
a number of people that introduce DevOps

00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:35,799
I find that to be exceedingly

00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:38,139
interesting particularly because what it

00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:40,059
means is that for you're almost getting

00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:42,009
an equal response that people that are

00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:43,389
introducing a new technology having this

00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:45,639
conversation changing the way people

00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:47,139
thinks talking to their engineering

00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:48,460
buddies and having them think about

00:25:47,139 --> 00:25:50,229
things a little bit differently and

00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:53,229
you're accomplishing great things and

00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:55,389
it's spreading so as you're planting a

00:25:53,229 --> 00:25:58,330
seed another one's popping up whether it

00:25:55,389 --> 00:26:00,460
wants to or not and eventually the idea

00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:02,559
is that these things take root and and

00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:06,210
and really change organizations that's

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:08,619
why we are here that's why we do DevOps

00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:11,799
according to the triple community we no

00:26:08,619 --> 00:26:14,379
longer need to explain why DevOps I mean

00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:17,019
if you look at it this one here no why

00:26:14,379 --> 00:26:18,700
should i use DevOps what the heck is it

00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:22,299
thirty-three percent of the respondents

00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:24,969
in 2012 said why I don't even understand

00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:27,279
what you're talking about in 2014 I had

00:26:24,969 --> 00:26:29,499
one response that said why and i'm

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,169
pretty sure based on who put it in there

00:26:29,499 --> 00:26:34,090
it was a sarcastic response

00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:36,999
so that says a lot about where we are

00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:38,559
where we've been coming from and we'll

00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:40,690
get to where we're going in a little bit

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,119
but that comes back to the tenants of

00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:45,099
DevOps you have to measure to be able to

00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:47,049
have the right conversation with the

00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:48,970
right people at the right time and if

00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:50,679
you're not prepared to do that you're

00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:52,299
going to reinvent the wheel you're going

00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:56,889
to work harder than you need to work and

00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:58,960
you need to solve that in my opinion so

00:26:56,889 --> 00:27:01,239
about your site is your current

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,099
production site up to date basically

00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:05,070
this is a security question how many

00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:08,229
outstanding security issues do you have

00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:09,999
that we know about eighty seven percent

00:27:08,229 --> 00:27:12,849
of respondents are subscribed to Drupal

00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:15,489
security news and that is pretty good um

00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:17,409
I think that's up from i think it was in

00:27:15,489 --> 00:27:19,929
the 60s when they had first asked this

00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:22,389
question so i was pretty excited about

00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:24,849
that the percentage of sites that are up

00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:28,509
to date for core only decreased by

00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:29,979
thirteen percent so basically that could

00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:32,649
be read a couple of different ways the

00:27:29,979 --> 00:27:34,479
way that I'm going to state it until

00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:35,999
somebody proves me wrong is that people

00:27:34,479 --> 00:27:39,669
are getting better at maintaining

00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:42,749
control the percentage of sites that are

00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:45,879
up to date for both core and contribute

00:27:42,749 --> 00:27:48,220
seems pretty positive the percentage of

00:27:45,879 --> 00:27:50,950
sites that are not up to date at all has

00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:53,619
increased by four percent so basically

00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:55,479
what this is telling us is that we seem

00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:57,700
to have a difficult time keeping up

00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:59,259
we're not doing devops properly and

00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,169
we're not teaching it properly because

00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:04,210
the people still cannot keep up and if

00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:06,820
there is anything to know about Drupal

00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:09,190
it is a very public piece of software

00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,960
there is a lot of security issues with

00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:12,759
it you need to be aware of them you need

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,559
to keep your site's up to date otherwise

00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:16,659
we'll have something like what happened

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:19,989
with WordPress and all the Drupal sites

00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:27,039
become bot farm basically we kind of

00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:28,570
don't want that so basically as we talk

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,999
more and more about site development we

00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:32,590
start seeing some trends more people are

00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:34,809
developing using multiple environments

00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:37,539
we're starting to see really good use of

00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:39,909
debs staging testing those types of

00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:41,480
environments pop up people are hearing

00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:42,650
the conversation there under

00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,380
standing what it is that we're doing

00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:47,990
their efficiency in that process is is

00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:50,270
probably the next conversation but at

00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:52,700
least they're listening this highlights

00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:54,110
the need for consistency between

00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,330
environments and this goes back to

00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:58,250
testing and being able to define what it

00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:00,559
is that you're doing not only from an

00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:02,059
engineering perspective but what is that

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,320
thing that you're doing from a security

00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:05,540
perspective what is that thing that

00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,700
you're doing from a metrics perspective

00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,770
if I introduce that to my system how do

00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,210
i send a notification to the right ops

00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:13,549
person that they're going to need to

00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,900
tweak something in varnish for example

00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:16,820
to be able to keep up with me where they

00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,919
need to spin it up another machine they

00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,299
have to have some sort of an indicator

00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:22,000
and I think that if you're doing

00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:23,780
test-driven development and you're doing

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,940
possibly behavior driven development

00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:28,730
depending on your type of organization

00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:30,679
that you have mechanisms to be able to

00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:32,419
make that type of connection send that

00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:35,450
type of signal and communicate with

00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:36,740
those people efficiently eight percent

00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,720
of respondents are still deploying

00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:42,290
critical changes on production first or

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,870
unaware of what a critical fix is that

00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:47,030
says a lot I mean that maybe that's your

00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:49,970
you know where I started in my basement

00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:51,590
writing Drupal sites working on one site

00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:53,450
it's all I had I it's all I could afford

00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:54,860
I going to do anything else so maybe

00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:57,620
that's that crowd I don't know it's a

00:29:54,860 --> 00:30:00,140
disconcerting number to me I don't think

00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:06,470
that anybody should not know how to

00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:08,630
update a Drupal site so these are fun

00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:10,610
slides and I say that these are fun

00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:13,250
slides because let's step back from the

00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:15,110
presentation for a minute there's a very

00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:17,540
active conversation going on right now

00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:19,340
and I've kind of hinted at the concept

00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:21,380
of code smells where you think that what

00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,740
you're doing is so unique that it can't

00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:26,270
possibly fit into anybody else's pattern

00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,919
there's a certain level of blindness

00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:31,669
that happens once you make that

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:33,230
assumption and I've seen great

00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:36,140
improvements happen when people can

00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:38,500
remove that blindness so we'll just

00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:40,160
continue on for a little bit more

00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,860
ninety-six percent of respondents

00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,630
utilized version control you'll notice

00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:48,260
that this charge is starting to move

00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:51,100
quite a bit in 2012 it was not that we

00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:53,150
definitely had people that were a little

00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,080
diversified and how they actually use

00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:56,710
version control

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,490
but it's changing it's getting fixed

00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:01,549
basically what's wrong with the other

00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:04,100
four percent I don't understand how you

00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:05,779
can exist in today's world and not use

00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:09,250
version control I mean just for your

00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:12,110
sanity but that's neither here nor there

00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:14,120
so remember the time amount of time that

00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,620
we spent bike shedding the migration to

00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:18,649
get how many people actually remember

00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:21,529
that conversation it went on for months

00:31:18,649 --> 00:31:23,750
and months and months and we are still

00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:25,970
bike shedding about it and still talking

00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:28,130
about it and still arguing about it and

00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:30,740
I've had some of the most brilliant

00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:32,149
people in the Drupal community come into

00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:35,480
organizations and make recommendations

00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:36,950
about things like source control because

00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,590
it's what they're comfortable with but

00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:42,320
they don't they're engineers right they

00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:45,470
don't really balance that people aspect

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,450
and if you're noticing a trend where

00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:49,750
most of the world is doing something

00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:52,549
else and you're not willing to

00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:55,250
participate there then you might be

00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:57,649
short circuiting your effectiveness and

00:31:55,250 --> 00:32:00,289
we see that pretty clearly in the next

00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:03,679
slide ninety-four percent of respondents

00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:05,059
now use get what this tells me is I

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,130
don't ever have to ask this question

00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:09,950
again we can stop talking about get

00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:12,289
versus CBS versus svn if you're not

00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:14,419
doing it with ninety-four percent of the

00:32:12,289 --> 00:32:16,460
community supporting that decision and

00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:18,169
then that's your prerogative have a nice

00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:21,830
day I'm going to stick with the

00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:26,149
ninety-four percent svn is the next

00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:28,100
closest with two percent interesting all

00:32:26,149 --> 00:32:30,710
the ones that were relevant and

00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:33,620
disappeared on they weren't even a line

00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:35,360
item so that says how quickly this

00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,919
industry changes and that's also one of

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,990
the traps that we all need to be aware

00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:40,490
of is the second that somebody like me

00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:43,010
stands up here and tells you that

00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:46,340
something is a certain way it's changing

00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:48,260
already your technology your code the

00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:51,500
things that you implement is workflows

00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:53,360
you need to remove emotional attachments

00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,220
and understand how to utilize those

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,210
things in a way that is effective for

00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:58,549
what it is that you're trying to

00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,950
accomplish and I can guarantee you that

00:32:58,549 --> 00:33:02,539
you will be a better developer and a

00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:05,990
better person as a result of it it's

00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:07,070
very interesting so about site

00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:09,409
development

00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:11,679
the use of continued a continuous

00:33:09,409 --> 00:33:14,419
integration platforms is increasing

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,429
everybody's heard Jenkins it's

00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:19,039
consistently outperforming other

00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:21,230
platforms and adoption that tends to be

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:25,309
I think because of you know things like

00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:27,649
open source or human nature you start

00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:29,480
talking about a complicated problem just

00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:31,029
a couple people start putting forth a

00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,470
lot of effort they come up with a

00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:35,240
reasonable solution a couple more people

00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,500
start talking about that they all start

00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,269
understanding it better and then it

00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:41,840
starts spreading until eventually it's

00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:43,399
such a known commodity that everybody's

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,960
just kind of doing it you saw that

00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:46,940
happen with get I think you're going to

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,830
see similar things here depending on

00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:54,259
your level of enterprise pneus so let's

00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:56,149
keep going the types of tests we run our

00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:58,610
relatively consistent over time and

00:33:56,149 --> 00:34:00,289
those of you that are data scientist and

00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:01,879
very well versed in this type of thing

00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:05,000
will note immediately that this should

00:34:01,879 --> 00:34:07,039
probably be a bar chart I'm not a data

00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,260
scientist I just use Google Docs and

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:12,290
click buttons and this is what came out

00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,909
so please fix it but what is interesting

00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:16,639
here is that you'll notice that the

00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:18,649
breakup of this particular chart doesn't

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:23,629
really fluctuate that much what that

00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:25,579
tells me is that we basically know what

00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:27,470
is that we're testing how we're going to

00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:29,780
go about doing it on and those

00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:32,329
technologies are not in flux it's a two

00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:34,790
year time span so why even have those

00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:36,560
questions anymore it from a Drupal

00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:38,690
perspective it seems like we are most

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,079
interested in performance followed by

00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:44,510
usability followed by GUI testing on so

00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,879
what that tells me is that if I want to

00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:49,490
be very effective it's supporting Drupal

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:51,500
teams that I should probably find some

00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:54,139
way to do those three things effectively

00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:57,170
and maybe let the rest of them slide for

00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:59,240
a little bit I'm not forever but if I'm

00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:00,859
communicating properly I'm doing it in

00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,780
an open-source way and I'm putting this

00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:05,060
stuff out there then other people can

00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,380
use it other people can adopt it and I

00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,660
won't have to have this conversation

00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:14,300
again I have three very good ways of

00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:15,980
doing x y and z and let's collaborate so

00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,579
site development the use of testing

00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:20,450
frameworks is increasing that is awesome

00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:20,720
operations people i don't know if any of

00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,660
you

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,790
ever seen it there's a DevOps gift

00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:28,670
basically that shows the difference

00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:30,859
between a script Wroten written by a

00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:33,290
system administrator and a script

00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:35,390
written by a programmer the system

00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:36,890
administrator script looks like

00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:38,990
something out of terminators this

00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:41,540
gargantuan robot this is stomping around

00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:43,640
and then you look at what the developer

00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:46,880
wrote and it's this very precise thing

00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:49,430
that's moving marbles very rapidly very

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,840
precise it's a very interesting paradigm

00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:52,910
and I think that one of the things that

00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,950
is being in great is that frameworks

00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:56,900
open source what we're doing as a

00:35:54,950 --> 00:36:00,710
community is applicable across the board

00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:02,840
and it's being adopted selenium right

00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:04,670
now leads the pack that ties back to the

00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,680
fact that we are very interested in

00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:09,020
usability testing we are very interested

00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:11,090
in GUI testing we're very interested in

00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:15,430
what those button clickers are capable

00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:18,230
of doing cucumber has increased by 2%

00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:20,540
behavior driven development it is an

00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:22,220
interesting paradigm there's an entire

00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:25,280
school of thought as to whether or not

00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:28,280
it's cipal to technology or if it's just

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,560
applicable to business on but in both

00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:34,430
cases there's value and it should be

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,740
considered B hat is the biggest mover at

00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:39,260
almost seven percent and straight up yay

00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:41,660
symphony for so many reasons I mean they

00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:44,180
symphonies introducing the Drupal

00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:47,050
community to how to write test properly

00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:50,720
it's helping provide frameworks that are

00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:52,839
used by others it's giving us structure

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,790
and helping the entire community learn

00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:57,470
things that are removing blinders that

00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:59,270
are helping them think out of the box on

00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:03,830
be had is one of the most phenomenal

00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:05,930
things out of this in my opinion another

00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:07,460
good thing about symphony in the general

00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:09,290
direction of Drupal 8 right now is that

00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:11,359
you know configs are starting to go into

00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:17,320
files it's about time I can start

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:19,369
sourcing this stuff it's great so

00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:22,460
continuing with site development more

00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:23,960
developers are working locally what

00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:27,200
you're saying here is basically a

00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,940
decrease in live production work you're

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,920
seeing a decrease in working on on

00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,570
stating environments you're seeing a

00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,250
decrease in working on development

00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:35,080
environment

00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:37,210
but you are seeing people bringing stuff

00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:40,000
further and further back in which goes

00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:42,220
back to that tweet you'd need to be able

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,600
to do that efficiently everybody's doing

00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,250
it everybody's starting to do it these

00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,450
systems are coming online they're active

00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:48,250
there live they're doing what they're

00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:51,930
supposed to be doing and the developers

00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:51,930
are reacting and this is a sign of that

00:37:53,940 --> 00:38:00,490
and back to consistency for divine

00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:02,740
environments basically I was talking to

00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:04,870
a gentleman at the booth the other day

00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:06,520
and he came up to me and said that I

00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:10,630
have a vendor that I'm working with and

00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:12,940
I have a particular issue where I tested

00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:15,070
on two or three environments that I have

00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:17,350
and I push it up following their

00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:19,120
procedures doesn't work in their

00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:20,590
production environment works in every

00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:23,140
other environment up to that point and

00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:24,850
they won't give me any logs I can't see

00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:27,010
what's going on I can't adjust anything

00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:30,220
that I'm working on I have to wait for a

00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:33,370
ticket from some deep dark Department

00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:35,320
inside of this this organization and I

00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:37,420
haven't gotten a response I can't get a

00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,580
response it's like black hair or black

00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:42,550
boy you know black box there you go

00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:47,230
that's what that's called it's not open

00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:49,930
source it's it's disconcerting and again

00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:52,960
this slide kind of highlights the growth

00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:55,330
you'll see here in this 12.9 percent the

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,280
virtualization is increasing whether or

00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:59,260
not people are doing it right whether or

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,850
not people are understanding it whether

00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,770
or not people are sending people down

00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:05,560
the wrong path by making recommendations

00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:07,090
that aren't properly thought out it's

00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,650
increasing we need to deal with it we

00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:14,020
need to accept all those scenarios and

00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:17,170
we need to make it work so basically

00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:19,210
this is an awesome slide because what

00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:20,860
we're seeing across the board is that

00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:22,960
when we're asking people how do you

00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:24,880
configure your modules people are

00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,900
starting to do it the right way and it

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,580
is about time I do not enjoy logging

00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,650
into a site having to click into the

00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:34,510
admin page to configure a module I don't

00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:36,070
think anybody should ever have to do

00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:38,320
that unless they're testing something

00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:39,550
out but what we're seeing is that

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,040
features is bridging this gap

00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:44,230
considerably for Drupal 7 and we're

00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,170
seeing adoption of features come up

00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:48,000
eighteen percent in a two

00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:50,490
your time period and that's pretty

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,140
substantial that's huge manual

00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:54,960
configuration changes from the GUI are

00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:56,370
down twenty-seven percent apparently

00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,020
people don't like clicking buttons

00:39:56,370 --> 00:40:02,400
either at least the people that are

00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:04,350
willing to fill out this survey site

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,470
profile installations have improved from

00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:10,620
less than one percent which blows my

00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:12,900
mind to six percent how many of you use

00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:17,090
site install profiles when you deploy

00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:19,890
Drupal a fair number of people in here

00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:23,550
there is no way to programmatically

00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:25,620
install a site wait without that in some

00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:27,210
capacity you're either doing a database

00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:31,080
dump you're starting from a certain

00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:33,660
point it's it's it's really a shame if

00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,130
you're not using an install profile and

00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,830
you're not doing it in a way that it's

00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:39,060
reusable for your organization

00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:42,800
particularly if your organization's

00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:46,440
responsibility is to deal with clients

00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,480
I'll stop their database installations

00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,280
have decreased by nine percent what that

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,040
means is people dumping database from

00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,290
local let's slap it up to production or

00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,110
wherever else that is the worst possible

00:40:55,290 --> 00:41:00,060
way to install a Drupal site and I

00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:02,100
really do hope that nobody is doing it

00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:04,680
here if you need clarification on that

00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:08,670
come talk to me afterwards and we'll sit

00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:12,600
down heavy use of features as increased

00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:14,880
by nine percent so basically what that's

00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,680
saying is that in those install profiles

00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,720
it's likely that you're going to find

00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,280
some features work there it features is

00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,680
doing some great things in this space

00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,110
right now features strong on this those

00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:28,200
are all fantastic tools they can get a

00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:30,930
little unwieldy sometimes but it is the

00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,460
best that we have right now so what's

00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:34,350
behind Drupal it's safe to say that

00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:37,010
Apache and engine X are dominating this

00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:40,470
particular market plain and simple

00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:42,900
nobody mentioned I is and we gave them

00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:44,610
the opportunity to do so engine axe

00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:49,080
usage as a web server is increased by

00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:53,250
twelve percent which is I think a

00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:57,450
disruptive point to pay attention to the

00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:59,160
underdog here has basically dethrone the

00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:01,920
king I mean planes

00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,780
engine X is taking over it's it's really

00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,390
an effective technology at what it does

00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:09,420
and I think a key component of why it is

00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:12,300
as effective as it is is because it

00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:14,340
focuses on a smaller subset of tasks

00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:17,130
it's identified those tasks and it

00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:19,830
focuses to do those very well it's the

00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:21,990
key to why linux is as stable as it is

00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:23,790
it's the key to why linux has been

00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:25,620
around as long as it is if you are

00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:27,900
developing a project that is so

00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:29,700
infinitely complex it's going to take

00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,580
weeks and months to figure out how to

00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:37,470
even start you are doing it wrong plain

00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:39,360
and simple data systems are increasing

00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:41,400
in complexity we know this because we're

00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:45,560
seeing increases in replication across

00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:47,940
the board it's very interesting now

00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:50,010
single instances of my sequel are down

00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,350
roughly twenty eight percent and this

00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:53,910
you know this is data take it with a

00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:55,890
grain of salt I have a very specific

00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:57,720
subset of people that probably filled

00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:59,250
this out there likely a little more on

00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,830
the enterprise but it's still an

00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:04,050
interesting statistic a fair amount of

00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:05,700
this replication growth is a result of

00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:09,660
hosting providers that cater to Drupal

00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:12,240
that's my wild-ass assumption there's no

00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:14,040
merit or basis to that but it might be

00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,540
true what we're seeing highlighted in

00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,700
some of these other slides is that

00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:20,640
people are using more ammo hosting

00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:23,760
providers on because it simplifies their

00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:27,660
process it also locks them into a silo

00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,160
so it's an interesting trade-off so

00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:31,020
what's behind Drupal are you using

00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:34,230
memcache time I'm surprised that we

00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:38,460
still have to ask this but it is true we

00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:41,550
do we've identified that when CES Redis

00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:43,290
actually came up quite a bit and and I

00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:47,100
think that sauna mom sent me a couple

00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:49,290
tweets specifically about it joking but

00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,700
you need to start looking at caching

00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:52,560
layer so you need to start looking at a

00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:55,170
pc you need to look in an opcode cash

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:58,470
you need to be able to to use Redis

00:43:55,170 --> 00:44:01,110
memcache varnish anything else in front

00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:03,000
of it Drupal needs a lot of help

00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:04,920
sometimes these tools are very effective

00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,230
at reducing your infrastructure costs

00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,790
across the board if you are in a

00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:09,650
scenario where you may be dealing with

00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:11,960
some old metal

00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:14,329
you need to get your entire

00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:16,490
organizations costs under control it's a

00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:20,930
great way to have a high impact if

00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:22,609
you're not already using it so basically

00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:24,260
varnish is increased by seventeen

00:44:22,609 --> 00:44:26,059
percent relative percentage of people

00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:28,609
not using this layer of caching has

00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:30,200
decreased by twenty percent this is good

00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:32,299
that means we're making the internet a

00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,609
better place we're improving people's

00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:36,170
experiences we're addressing usability

00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:39,079
across the board as a result of it

00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:41,990
indirectly it's all really cool how it

00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:44,180
ties together the use of H a proxy is

00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:46,910
increasing you need to pay attention to

00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:48,619
that H a proxy is a very valuable tool

00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:50,359
it is something that you should really

00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:53,329
consider if you haven't already put it

00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:55,819
in your arsenal Apache keeps losing

00:44:53,329 --> 00:44:57,529
market share it's an interesting

00:44:55,819 --> 00:44:59,569
statement it's not even a question

00:44:57,529 --> 00:45:02,270
anymore they are losing market share

00:44:59,569 --> 00:45:04,869
their losing out to smaller more

00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:08,150
efficient more capable projects that are

00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:11,750
more focused it's something to consider

00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:17,240
when you design your workflows in your

00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:19,039
business practices internal dedicated

00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:21,140
infrastructure is down by nine percent

00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:23,299
less people are hosting in-house more

00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:25,279
people are hosting in the cloud shared

00:45:23,299 --> 00:45:27,319
server usage has fallen by fourteen

00:45:25,279 --> 00:45:30,079
percent that is phenomenal you're going

00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:32,390
to hear a lot about openshift it's a

00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:34,490
fantastic technology it does a lot of

00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:38,270
really cool things you should check it

00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:41,119
out it probably has it will probably

00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:45,289
impact that number more significantly as

00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:46,940
we continue forward and it's true I mean

00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:48,740
we're migrating to the cloud if you need

00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:51,799
any further proof I don't know why

00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:55,880
you're here so basically what it boils

00:45:51,799 --> 00:45:57,799
down to is DevOps is kind of like a

00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,240
spiral or a spiral of life or whatever

00:45:57,799 --> 00:46:02,420
you want to call it I'll go a little bit

00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:04,490
Zen and holistic on everybody think of

00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:06,410
it like the washing machine right when

00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:08,930
you're at the top point of that washing

00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:10,670
machine you have something like oh we

00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:12,440
need to focus on project management you

00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:15,289
come back down a little bit and then oh

00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,940
well project management nailing it but

00:46:15,289 --> 00:46:19,490
marketing's in the way these guys are

00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:21,090
promising these girls are promising all

00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:22,770
kinds of stuff that I

00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:24,240
a deliverer so let's rain that in a

00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:26,430
little bit so let's come down here and

00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,740
see what's left o development needs some

00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:30,600
improvement now so let's let's call this

00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,920
dev ops and let's go over here and do

00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,720
this thing and then by the time you get

00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,720
to the top it's not a perfect circle

00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:38,670
you've solved points along the way they

00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,230
may not be perfect solutions but they

00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:42,480
are something that have improved your

00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:44,460
scenario in your situation and when you

00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,510
come back around you have the ability to

00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:50,040
get a little more focused a little more

00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:51,600
effective a little more surgical what it

00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:54,090
is that you're doing and you refine the

00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:56,130
message and you keep doing it don't ever

00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:58,290
get stuck in the thought or the mindset

00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:00,180
that what you're doing right now is the

00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:03,960
only way to do it it is the right way to

00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:08,250
do it you will basically go broke if you

00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:10,500
do that so the moment of Zen is passed

00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:12,390
and I promised an iPad to the people

00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:17,670
that fill this thing out I'm going to

00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:21,000
deliver so I have put this into a

00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:23,310
third-party service it can be audited by

00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,700
anybody that wants to delinks out there

00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:28,740
on the presentation that's checked him

00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:31,410
to github it all ties together it's kind

00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:34,770
of cool this is the gentleman the one

00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:36,480
his name is Nicola page unfortunately he

00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:40,860
is not here with us today I sent him an

00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:44,700
email he is I believe he said rafting

00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:46,590
down the canals of Venice I didn't want

00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:50,940
to interrupt him I was like that sounds

00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:53,130
cool but he won the drawing and that's

00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,960
basically it if you have any thoughts

00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:56,460
there's a couple of really good places

00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,760
for you to focus the first one is

00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:01,500
drupal.org / DevOps I know it's a stupid

00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,660
word I know that it sends the wrong

00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:05,100
connotation a lot of times and I retract

00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:09,210
the use of the word stupid because

00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:10,170
obviously that's incorrect but it's a

00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:11,790
great place to have this conversation

00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:13,140
there's a lot of people that are

00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:15,180
listening there it's not used

00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,500
effectively but that's because we need

00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:18,720
to come together and we need to figure

00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:21,830
out and identify how to use it to solve

00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:24,150
your problems and I need help with that

00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:25,950
going to have a bawth to discuss this

00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:28,320
very thing I would encourage anybody

00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:29,880
that has any questions or it just wants

00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,070
to talk please show up it's going to be

00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:34,180
fun it's going to happen this Thursday

00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:36,430
1045 to 1145

00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:38,980
and evaluate this session I mean plans

00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:40,980
simple the DA works very hard to be able

00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:43,360
to put these shows together if you don't

00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:45,790
give them the information that they need

00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,800
like hey maybe this DevOps track needs

00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:49,960
to be restructured a little bit maybe it

00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:52,870
should be focused more on performance

00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,940
maybe it should be more security they

00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:56,650
will not have that data or that feedback

00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:58,840
unless you give it to them and we cannot

00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:02,740
adjust the content of these shows so

00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:10,480
please do that and that's it um any

00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:11,980
questions did I scare everybody sure

00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:17,800
there's a microphone up here if you

00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:20,400
could just form a line we have about

00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,400
five minutes

00:49:33,329 --> 00:49:41,040
ciao apologize for my English totally

00:49:37,089 --> 00:49:44,800
fine and just a question about what is

00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:50,619
the state of mind for network at Forest

00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:54,310
System on with Drupal for example for

00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:57,849
synchronize the files directory between

00:49:54,310 --> 00:50:01,119
a lot of well I think that by mindset

00:49:57,849 --> 00:50:02,920
what it comes down to it is testing I

00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,079
think that at first most people need to

00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,849
understand what that is and what tools

00:50:05,079 --> 00:50:08,800
and components are involved in it and

00:50:06,849 --> 00:50:11,109
the minds that comes about from showing

00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,700
people how to to validate what it is

00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:14,200
that they're doing with those things and

00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:16,329
understanding what those things should

00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:18,849
be doing and I think that that for most

00:50:16,329 --> 00:50:20,380
people that's the challenge right now if

00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,970
you'd like to okay you can basically

00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:23,800
come to the ball and let's sit down and

00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:27,839
talk and I'll give you some milk really

00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:32,320

00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,430
feedback while you're here talk to

00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:38,589
people the sessions are great but I

00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:40,089
think that your real value is from the

00:50:38,589 --> 00:50:41,859
people that are around you there's a lot

00:50:40,089 --> 00:50:43,480
of emperors interesting conversations

00:50:41,859 --> 00:50:46,800
that you can have and I encourage you to

00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,800
