Developing on your local machine can be a really smart choice. Local development is much faster for most developers and more reliable in many situations where internet connectivity can be an issue.

However, getting started with local development can be a little tricky. Not only do you need to install a complete web stack on your computer, but you also need to configure it for each project and make sure it integrates properly with your production environment / workflow.

Enter the power of Vagrant - the hottest tool on the web for building complete development environments - which quickly allows you to build a development environment on top of a locally run virtual machine (i.e. Virtual Box) and have it reliably configured using automation software (i.e. Puppet).

Want this to all be configured for you? Check out the freely available, Node.JS powered Kalabox. With one click you can easily spin-up your own local development environment using Vagrant, Virtual Box, and Puppet. Create new sites with a click of the button, integrate into cloud development platforms like Pantheon, and automatically update when new versions are released. Forget the elephants, let's go with something modern and get on with coding some amazing websites!

Come to this session if you are interested in local development! Learn about cutting edgfe technologies like Vagrant, Virtual Box, Puppet, and Kalabox. Experience the full power of Kalabox through a live demonstration. Leave impressed and inspired to embrace local development to its fullest.
