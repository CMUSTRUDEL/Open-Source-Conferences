Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: LOCAL DEV FOR THE MASSES: VAGRANT + VIRTUAL BOX + PUPPET + KALABOX
Publication date: 2014-06-05
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: pirogpopulist
Developing on your local machine can be a really smart choice. Local development is much faster for most developers and more reliable in many situations where internet connectivity can be an issue.

However, getting started with local development can be a little tricky. Not only do you need to install a complete web stack on your computer, but you also need to configure it for each project and make sure it integrates properly with your production environment / workflow.

Enter the power of Vagrant - the hottest tool on the web for building complete development environments - which quickly allows you to build a development environment on top of a locally run virtual machine (i.e. Virtual Box) and have it reliably configured using automation software (i.e. Puppet).

Want this to all be configured for you? Check out the freely available, Node.JS powered Kalabox. With one click you can easily spin-up your own local development environment using Vagrant, Virtual Box, and Puppet. Create new sites with a click of the button, integrate into cloud development platforms like Pantheon, and automatically update when new versions are released. Forget the elephants, let's go with something modern and get on with coding some amazing websites!

Come to this session if you are interested in local development! Learn about cutting edgfe technologies like Vagrant, Virtual Box, Puppet, and Kalabox. Experience the full power of Kalabox through a live demonstration. Leave impressed and inspired to embrace local development to its fullest.

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:16,020
the masses vagrant virtualbox puppet and

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:21,029

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:22,890
very good drupalcon austin yeah freaking

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,260
fabulous operation awesome conference

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,660
glad to see so many people and hopefully

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,730
we can talk about some of your problems

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,500
give you some solutions and otherwise

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,170
just build the energy that has been

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,660
happening all week my name is Matt

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,239
Cheney I am a co-founder of the pantheon

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,550
focusing on the products magic chaos

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,770
websites and ultimately trying to really

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,329
help developers and to help all of my

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,250
friends in Drupal for which I've been

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:50,039
doing pretty much my entire adult life

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,930
like have better tools have more fun and

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,879
make the internet better I think that's

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,890
good for everything and definitely

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,350
something that I know a lot of a lot of

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,660
you in the room here share I do believe

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,340
I'll live forever but when I do stupid

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,920
stuff and say Yolo it lacks a certain

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,470
pop at that point but will resolve those

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,610
inconsistencies a lot of with along with

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,070
everything else that we're going to talk

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,869
about today because part of the work

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,420
that out that we all do at Pantheon is

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:18,090
to build tools to help developers make

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,770
make the internet better that a lot of

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,290
the things that every day we have to

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,540
write code for do config for do set up

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,369
for our the same that I do the same

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,409
stuff that Mike does same stuff that you

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:31,020
stow and that's part of the awesomeness

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,700
of Drupal is that we have open source we

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,740
have reusable components that other

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,290
people can share and leverage and makes

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,700
happen and that as we look sort of into

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,009
the future of the web it's not just

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,750
getting the right PHP code on the system

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,909
but it's about providing a whole

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,220
ecosystem of integrated tools and

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,340
technologies that can really sort of

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,479
make all of this happen and so this is

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,189
definitely part of the sort of

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,680
philosophy of what we're trying to do

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:59,009
here and part of the value of open

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,110
source and that I really think that this

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,119
Kalibak product that Mike is doing and a

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,100
lot of the work he's done to help

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,600
improve local development is really

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,459
taking the kind of approach that

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,709
pantheon took to trying to create better

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,030
development hosting in a platform Calla

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,170
box is trying to solve those same

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,349
problems for local develop

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,870
it so it is my pleasure to this Maya my

00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:28,260
friend Mike to talk about himself and

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:29,760
talk a little bit about the Cal box to

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,600
adjust this because we have a size

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:38,010
differential happening sweet yeah

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:42,480
drupalcon Austin it's happening is that

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:44,849
really wow thank you John pack all right

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,380
cool yeah hi my name is mike i'm a

00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:49,650
co-founder of cali muna much like matt i

00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,299
work on our products and as you can see

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,420
by my thing I like science and math and

00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:56,819
history and other things and when I was

00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:00,350
five years old I accidentally lit a

00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:04,110
trashcan on fire with a magnifying glass

00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:05,190
so yeah that happens anyway yeah so if

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,290
you haven't heard Callie Munna is a

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,230
Drupal agency in the san francisco east

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,160
bay we're in downtown oakland and we we

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,330
like to make the internet for a

00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,980
rabble-rousing companies and

00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,230
organizations if you're here and you're

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:20,880
from pfizer we will not work with you so

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:23,100
there you go I said it thank you but we

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,410
also build products on occasion which is

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,730
we're going to talk about today and that

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,799
brings us to the presentation which is

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,560
as matt said local debt for the masses

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:35,250
which is a vagrant virtualbox puppet and

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,660
cala box and now i'm going to bump it

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,880
back to matt to explain the space a

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,880
little bit and then we can go into the

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,160
into the magic the deep magics the chaos

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,780
magics so I think we're only as good as

00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,519
the tools that we have I think that was

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,290
part of my introduction marks and that

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,180
you know the kinds of websites we build

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,500
my kind of work we do is standing on the

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,570
shoulders of a lot of other people

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,579
helping to make that better and that

00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,890
having those tools are really important

00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:00,900
because like honestly doing Drupal is

00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,910
hard enough like figuring out the

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,310
craziness that is everything is Drupal 7

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,049
and will be Drupal 8 requires a lot of

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,079
work and there's a lot of problems there

00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,609
and that there are a lot of things that

00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,350
we need to get right to really do the

00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:15,389
best job that we can and if we're going

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,280
to win as community together if we're

00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,870
all going to be the kind developers we

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,030
want we're going to need those tools and

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,740
so it's really been very excellent over

00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,210
the last week to see all the folks here

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,290
at the drupalcon helping to solve those

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,180
problems collaborating together and

00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,800
working down the dow down down the path

00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,840
of all the different things we need to

00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,590
do to be really really awesome at our

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,940
jobs at our work and for our people and

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,200
local development and make it looked a

00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,910
little bit great is one of those

00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,430
problems is one of the things that we

00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,140
really need to do to make sure that we

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,390
can all be the best developers that we

00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,460
can when by local development I'm not

00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:51,250
just meaning getting PHP to run with a

00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,260
database on a computer I mean that is a

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,210
start for sure but I'm talking about a

00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,280
full stack I'm talking about being able

00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:00,130
to use a lot of the modern technologies

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,040
like varnish and reddish and solar on

00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,960
your local machine so you can have a you

00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,250
know more similar environment to what

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,350
you're doing online that you can

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,330
leverage and test I really make sure

00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,700
that what you are building is as close

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,230
as to what your customers your friends

00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,330
your you know volunteer organizations

00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,920
are able to see and that they'd be on

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,540
that you can actually integrate with

00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,730
other things that you can look at other

00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,040
cloud services other hosts dividers and

00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,840
link those together with your local

00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,730
development collaborate with your teams

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,980
and have a technology and open source

00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,810
technology you can contribute to to help

00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,340
really do this thing these kinds of

00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,170
things should be easy it should be easy

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,120
as simply turning on a button on your

00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:39,250
computer whatever kind of computer you

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,170
have and being able to easily get into

00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:44,110
the world of Drupal development and

00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:46,450
start making really amazing red sites so

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,400
grab a seat on black couch talking about

00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:50,140
a few of the problems I think with local

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,450
development now and then we'll get into

00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,890
a lot of solutions give you guys sort of

00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,660
things I don't think you can smoke in

00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,270
here although this is rick perry america

00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,740
so maybe you can i do know that you

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,330
cannot use spray paint by the way at

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,280
this conference it's a totally against

00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,080
the rules but you can in fact discharge

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,290
discharge a firearm during a

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,180
presentation which does require 30-day

00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:13,510
notice and some approval from someone

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,360
but we unfortunately did well we'll see

00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:17,979
okay

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,749
so I'm that's just a few questions here

00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:21,309
I mean I know the answer is a lot of

00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:22,689
these because I've been doing this for a

00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:25,149
while and a lot of my friends have been

00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:27,459
doing this for a while and that you know

00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:28,899
when we're sort of doing you know local

00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:30,819
development and trying to set that kind

00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:33,099
of stuff off like there's problems with

00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:34,839
getting it set up that each computer is

00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:36,729
different getting the ports to work

00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:39,369
right make sure the firewalls are there

00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:41,439
make sure that the software survives you

00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:43,899
know the Mavericks update or just in

00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,369
general like getting everything ready

00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:47,319
till do local development is a bunch of

00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:49,449
work and when you're doing that work

00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:51,429
it's work that honestly you're wasting

00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:52,899
against like other stuff that you could

00:06:51,429 --> 00:06:54,699
be doing I mean it's cool to tinker with

00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:56,469
stop having control of tech that's

00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:58,509
extremely important but if you're on a

00:06:56,469 --> 00:07:00,789
project and it's taking you an hour just

00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:02,439
to get set up with that project actually

00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:03,849
start working on it that's it's time

00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:05,830
that could have been done creating other

00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:06,999
features on the project and that's the

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,709
kind of thing where I think from the

00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:10,719
efficiency standpoint from building

00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:13,509
altogether why why waste that project

00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:15,249
time why solve all those problems it's

00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:16,989
also been really painful to see in you

00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:18,909
know variously various organizations and

00:07:16,989 --> 00:07:20,919
companies that I approached I'm aware

00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:23,349
where the folks who end up doing the IT

00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:24,939
support helping out with fixing people's

00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:26,499
local development are some of the

00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:28,839
smartest technical folks in the company

00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:30,519
it's the CTO or the lead devs that are

00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:32,559
going around and configuring this kind

00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:34,749
of stuff and I mean I know it's like far

00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:36,159
as all of us get where of careers and as

00:07:34,749 --> 00:07:38,229
much experience as we have we're all be

00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:39,490
doing i.t at some point for friends and

00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:42,099
family who are like you work in

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:44,139
computers please set up the Wi-Fi but if

00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:46,449
you're in a professionalization like you

00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:48,249
should doing having your best technical

00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:50,709
people have to set this kind of stuff up

00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:53,050
can be a little confusing Plus this is

00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:54,369
this is freaking 2014 you know shouldn't

00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,789
be we have cars that can drive

00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:59,889
themselves like why are we like manually

00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:01,479
editing v hos configurations we're

00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:03,279
starting Apache and hoping we didn't

00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:04,990
make a typo otherwise all the sights on

00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,360
their glocal will go down like there are

00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,129
better ways we can make this technology

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,800
we can build these kinds of things and

00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:13,569
we can solve these kinds of problems

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,490
because we want one solution want one

00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:17,559
solution to rule them all we want one

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,539
thing that people can use and this thing

00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:21,339
has to be an open source option it has

00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:23,469
to be integrated with everybody who's

00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:25,329
working in this space but we do want to

00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:28,149
bring them all in the cloud bind them

00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:28,340
that's ancient elvish if anyone wants to

00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:30,410
take

00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,930
crap about crack of that in the QA we

00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,700
can get with that but I think what an

00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,770
elephant in the room here is is the

00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,960
ma'am this is a technology I've used

00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,640
this is an attempt to try to create one

00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,610
solution I know a number of you might

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,900
use it uses ma'am or who like-likes

00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,300
using may out feels they're satisfied

00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,279
with that I'm lindo be embarrassed is

00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:53,210
not not necessarily about you be

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:55,190
embarrassed I mean look I understand

00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,050
relations and elephants as their logos

00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:00,710
may not be like the most popular I mean

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:02,150
nationally but that in general arm map

00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,710
is a good technology but it's an old

00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:06,170
technology it's been around for a while

00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:08,450
it doesn't speak necessarily our

00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,130
language it's sort of it's sort of

00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,290
ancient so I mean it does look like an

00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,510
elephant absolutely I mean some I think

00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:16,839
looks like a dinosaur and I think that

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:19,040
like there are there are you know

00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:21,410
evolutions and developments that happen

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,540
this world so I wanted to sort of turn

00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,940
it back over to Mike to talk about the

00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:31,400
you know creationist tertiary event that

00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:33,140
is the qella box Thank You Matthew that

00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,209
was nice I like dinosaurs so that like

00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,620
worked out really well anyway yeah so

00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:38,600
let's talk about let's talk about the

00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,730
post-apocalyptic hell escape that akala

00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,500
box creates which is a world where only

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:46,970
one thing exists which is Calla box and

00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,290
yeah so Kalibak said so advanced dev

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,209
tools for the people and what that means

00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:52,339
is we want to provide something that's

00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:55,850
easy to use like ma'am but actually is

00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:58,610
useful and powerful here's a little bit

00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,560
of info about it what we're kind of

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,850
talking about is that Cal box isn't even

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,500
a local development environment it's

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,720
much more than that what it actually is

00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,970
a complete desktop to live workflow loop

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,470
and what that actually means is that

00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,600
your local development environment now

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,370
can know about stuff that exists exists

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,550
outside of your computer for example

00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:19,430
pantheon or aqua or Aberdeen cloud or

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,510
eager or any of those fun things so we

00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,490
can think about it as it's really an

00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,709
extension of like your normal dev test

00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:27,680
live workflow now you have a fourth part

00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:29,779
of that called local or called Calla box

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,779
specifically your you're going to do

00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:33,950
that and you can have all those things

00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:35,000
linked together and you don't have to

00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,500
worry about all the kinds of problems

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,579
that that Matt talked about so this is

00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,290
the problem that we've we've been

00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:41,870
working on in kalabaw on a column you

00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:44,060
know quite a bit we kind of worked on it

00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,470
originally as like an internal thing but

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,880
over time we realized that it could be

00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,900
powerful to a lot of people and helpful

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,120
to a lot of people so we put it out

00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:54,529
there so what is Cowell box well besides

00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,710
besides the comet event that destroys

00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:59,060
everything else it is these things

00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,770
currently it is a native mac OS

00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,810
application that was written in nodejs

00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,890
on the node WebKit framework which is

00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:06,560
really cool if you haven't used it yet

00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:08,960
that lets you build applications for for

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,150
mac and linux and windows on node which

00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,339
is cool and it's a one-click installer

00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,839
so like man you have downloaded and you

00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,089
install it and it's it's good to go

00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:18,980
which is which is really awesome unlike

00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:20,779
ma'am it actually is a real linux web

00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,339
server that has all the power tools that

00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:24,050
you expect and need to run a triple

00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:27,650
website and do development locally in a

00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:29,360
real sort of way right now pal box does

00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,950
workflow integration with pantheons so

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,210
if you have a site on Pantheon you can

00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,290
download onto your computer really

00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,450
easily you don't have to worry about

00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,460
setting up vhosts as Matt mentioned

00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,960
which is like usual a huge problem and

00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,220
is kind of an embarrassment that we

00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,529
still have to do that considering all

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,420
the other great tech that we have you

00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:45,770
can also spin up just like normal Drupal

00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,230
sites really easily you know if you just

00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:51,050
want to like if you or if you are like

00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,279
intimidated by the barrier to entry when

00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,660
it comes to Drupal like setting up a

00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,010
Drupal site it's still kind of like

00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,900
difficult to do that if you don't know a

00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,250
lot about that sort of thing with

00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,690
Kalibak so you can download it you can

00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,100
install the whole thing and you can spin

00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,839
up a Drupal site in a couple of seconds

00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,940
which is really awesome you don't have

00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:06,560
to know what get is or SFTP or any of

00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,060
those fun things you can just get

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,040
started right away and when you're done

00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,110
you can deploy it to right now Pantheon

00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:15,589
but potentially other places in the

00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:17,150
future I was walking around yesterday in

00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:19,220
the exhibit hall by the way people have

00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:21,470
really like up their exhibit game this

00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,820
year like and I think does everyone

00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:25,010
offer free beer now is that like a

00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,540
requirement because I feel like there

00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,339
was just lots of beer going on yesterday

00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,080
which was by the way thank you that was

00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:32,000
great 200 people who have booths here

00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,650
that have free beer but anyway I was

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,089
walking around I'm trying to explain to

00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:38,000
people why they should use cow blocks

00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:40,660
what Kyle box is all about and this one

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,010
guy said oh so this is interesting so

00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:45,320
Calla box is kind of like to local

00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:47,510
devlet pantheon is to hosting which is

00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,670
that local dev doesn't really exist as a

00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:52,579
term anymore if you have cattle box and

00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:55,220
I said yeah that's awesome that's a

00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:56,329
great way to explain what this is and

00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,889
that was really helpful so that's a good

00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:59,720
analogy I think that we can use like try

00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:01,220
to describe like this whole situation

00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,600
and to give you a better sense of what

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,949
it is it's not local development it's

00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,040
more than that local development doesn't

00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:08,209
exist anymore because Kalibak sexists

00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,639
anyway these are all the fun things that

00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:12,139
it comes with by default most of you

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,579
know what these things are you don't

00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:15,379
have to do any of the setup they're all

00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:16,490
just they're all there for you right to

00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:19,160
begin with and like they're all

00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,779
optimized for Drupal so if you want to

00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,339
like you know get started running a

00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:23,420
website or I get starting debugging or

00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:24,920
like setting if you're setting up a

00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,930
developer who lives in Romania

00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,009
potentially you can have them install

00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,329
this thing and they can be debugging

00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:30,769
code in a couple of minutes instead of

00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:31,910
you know like four days later when

00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,560
they're like oh I finally got it working

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:37,069
on my local machine you're like great

00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,240
i'm really excited for you anyway for

00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:39,589
the people who are like more interested

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,240
in the technical aspect of this i'll go

00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:43,189
over it really quickly this is how it

00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,060
actually works there's a node WebKit

00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,550
front end which is the actual

00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,899
application on your machine and what it

00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,089
does is it installed VirtualBox and

00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:51,769
vagrant for you and then runs a bunch of

00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:53,540
puppet manifests that are stored in a

00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:54,889
github repo which is open source called

00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,529
Cala stack and that will set up your

00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:59,389
entire virtual machine locally and then

00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:02,000
it works on the two on terminus which is

00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:03,470
like the Pantheon like pseudo API that

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,660
connects to that it lets you do like

00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,829
workflow operations and we building on

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,540
top of it called Terminator which is

00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:11,209
also open source which you can use to

00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,800
actually do a lot of that stuff and it

00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:14,360
was all made possible by science which

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,879
is what makes many things possible and

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,360
is a powerful tool in general anyway I

00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,709
need to load raleigh fans in the house

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,019
no not a single bill o'reilly fan in the

00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:26,300
house are there any fans of this do it

00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:29,389
live video on YouTube okay there we go

00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,829
this is for you then anyway yeah so like

00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:31,879
I talk a lot about like the things that

00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,379
are in cala box but i think it's much

00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:35,240
better just show show it so we're going

00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:36,589
to do a little a little live demo and

00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,199
hopefully it goes well and if it doesn't

00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:40,750
i might just drop this bike and leave so

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,689
that could be exciting for you as well

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:49,540
we'll do it live well there we go we'll

00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:49,540
do it live thanks Matt

00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:55,220
anyway yeah so this is the Kalibak see

00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,420
you i I've started it it's uh it's got

00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,459
all these like things that let you know

00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,870
that that things are happening when we

00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:01,399
were designing it like it was weird

00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,899
because we didn't we wanted this like to

00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:04,339
folt the whole space but it didn't so we

00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:06,410
just added a bunch of like fun things

00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:09,529
into it like like your spirit animal

00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:11,180
mine is the fire Phoenix but if you

00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:12,529
download the new version that's coming

00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,089
out it'll during the installation

00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:15,890
workflow to ask you a bunch of questions

00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:17,660
and depending on your answer it will

00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,550
designate a fire animal or a spirit

00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,810
animal animal for you so don't worry

00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:24,230
that's like in its in the issue queue

00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:25,550
it's coming anyway yeah so like what's

00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,870
good let's get started and just kind of

00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,550
look at all the all the fun things that

00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:31,519
this that comes with what comes with the

00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:33,230
kallah box yeah so you have like a nice

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,420
UI it's like not super complicated

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,070
things are pretty clear you have your

00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,470
home tab that has like all this stuff on

00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,610
it some important tools that you can use

00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,870
this will like theoretically list your

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,060
sites we have none now so it lists

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,410
nothing and then right now this will

00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,329
authenticate you with Pantheon you can

00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,829
do like the workflow magic so let's just

00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:51,920
start with something basic which is just

00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:53,390
like creating a site order Nia is there

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,370
a favorite US president in the house

00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,860
like does anyone have a favorite US

00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,329
president at all brought the Furby hey

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,779
is great that's my favorite president

00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:05,260
too he stole that election in 1876

00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:10,279
called fraud be hazed totally false

00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:12,589
don't listen to this naysayer anyway

00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:13,940
yeah so I think he was the 19th

00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:17,899
president so what does it call the site

00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:20,120
big 19 and yeah so we'll just like set

00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:21,829
up this triple site and you can see the

00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,570
magic wheel is spinning the Drupal site

00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:24,649
is coming down and this will also be a

00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,480
great test to see how good the

00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:29,600
conference Wi-Fi is because this is all

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,829
going to be coming from drupal.org and

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,110
while it's happening we can kind of like

00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:37,839
there you go conference Wi-Fi has has

00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:41,690
spoken so that's bad let's try it again

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:44,320
or maybe I could connect to my phone

00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:48,250
into it which would be good as well

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,250
let's give it a shot one more time

00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:59,910
maybe another US president chester a

00:16:52,800 --> 00:17:03,050
arthur i'm a big Gilded Age fan so let's

00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:06,510
do this and see if the conference Wi-Fi

00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:09,900
doing live yes it's happening I could go

00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:10,920
write it and we'll do it live it doesn't

00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:16,530
work out I'm just going to like connect

00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:17,730
my thing to Mike okay let's do this and

00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:25,079
a tethered this to my phone we're gonna

00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:26,939
we're gonna do alive huh I know well

00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,380
luckily luckily Drupal 7 is really small

00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:30,090
if this was Drupal 8 I might like run

00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:34,590
out of my like data on this on this one

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:36,000
download so oh I just like it only I

00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,710
think there's a gap it's a fact right i

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,240
mean it's like definitely we got rid of

00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,950
overlay module in Drupal 8 at least

00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:45,980
don't have to download that it's a good

00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:45,980
point okay see

00:17:53,270 --> 00:18:11,550
good luck yes excellent okay so let's

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:15,750
see if this time what's that does

00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:19,559
convention center what are you doing

00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:22,830
over there I'm really sorry for the wolf

00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:24,570
anna d in that actually okay the

00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:27,270
soundboard i'm clicking on i found out

00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:29,220
the internet alright we have we have

00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:35,570
regained connectivity to something let's

00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:35,570
explore this space let's do

00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:46,350
buh-buh-buh-buh was that the nickname

00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:47,820
all right all right let's give another

00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,380
shot I was sneaky suspicion that this

00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,270
actually might be the same situation

00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,900
between the two conference wifis but

00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:56,460
also happens anyway while it's as

00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,390
Wallace is theoretically spinning up in

00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,179
the background we can go through and

00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:08,040
like look at some of the whoever set up

00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:15,690
the Wi-Fi here it go go this is why you

00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:18,270
don't do live demos all right sad when I

00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:25,290
can only rely on AT&T to assault my data

00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:26,610
needs let's try this again the so I just

00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,040
half of town it was up it was our a Time

00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:32,400
Warner shout out down here by someone

00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:34,950
okay okay there we go alright so now

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,570
we're connected to my phone and let's

00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,490
see how this works hopefully better

00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:41,040
we'll do it live yes we are gonna do it

00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:43,160
live well do it why I'm running out i'm

00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,860
also running out of presidents so

00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,929
Lincoln yeah that's a way more exciting

00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:51,179
is in Lincoln's boring and Cleveland was

00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:53,700
president twice that's 20 second and the

00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:56,220
24th president's right and was also

00:19:53,700 --> 00:20:00,030
chief chief justice or was that I was

00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:03,500
half that was tough yeah sorry okay

00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:03,500
third time's a charm Oh

00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:10,080
fourth times a charm this isn't Williams

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,960
Jenning Bryan running for president I

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,640
mean he tried but I don't know that

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,260
populist fervor I guess people didn't

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:21,000
like that huh anyway so Wi-Fi is looking

00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,520
maybe like it I mean my tethering looks

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,750
like maybe it's the way to go here so

00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,360
anyway that was that was a fun little

00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,860
adventure let's get back to the stuff

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,030
that's happening so anyway your site's

00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,309
downloading the background now which is

00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,270
great and there's all these other great

00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:34,710
tools that are baked into the whole

00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:36,120
thing for example like you can do a one

00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:38,280
click and you have like your PHP myadmin

00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,870
just ready to go which is nice right now

00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,280
we have no databases actually that's not

00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,240
true we have this this database which

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,549
maybe is the one that we're downloading

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,660
right now which is really cool and you

00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:50,630
know so you can have this like right out

00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,860
of the box which is a really sweet and

00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:54,390
you also have like other tools like if

00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,980
you use web grind for example which is

00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,360
like a profiling utility like that's all

00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,049
set up for you ready to go so you can

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,870
start to do that sort of magic you've

00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:05,429
also got this like this like engage

00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,750
button here which is like if you're if

00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:08,190
you're coding and you're like feeling

00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,049
really down about yourself you can click

00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:13,020
on this and it will load up this video

00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:14,280
of like of Patrick Stewart this will

00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:21,240
load up an advertisement from the

00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:22,919
YouTube for chairs this will load up a

00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,140
video Patrick Stewart so you can like

00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:26,429
your the depths of like development pain

00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,410
you can load this up and like have a

00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:30,780
smile and then by the time it's over you

00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:33,059
can bounce back and like you know your

00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:37,320
site is like has been spun up or not

00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:39,120
spun up I guess and be ready to go let's

00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,860
uh let's restart the whole thing

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,230
sometimes the Internet is finicky so

00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,100
we'll do that really quickly and while

00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:47,490
we're doing that what's really nice

00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,500
about cowell box is that all the code

00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,669
that's like store inside your vm is like

00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,710
also available to you like on your

00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:54,179
desktop so you can let go through here

00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,260
and you can like select a folder and

00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,940
likely load it up which is like really

00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,140
really awesome and you can work on like

00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,340
whatever tools you want like I know

00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,750
there are like stomach local development

00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,549
environments or like integrated workflow

00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:04,440
solutions which is like what Kalibak siz

00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:06,360
or you have to like use the tools that

00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,150
they ship with to do like the editing

00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,230
and the stuff like that and I I don't

00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,400
really like that like people should like

00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,530
feel free to use the tool so they

00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,000
actually want to use so we expose your

00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:16,530
code you can use whatever sort of tools

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,790
you want I think that's like a

00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:20,040
way better way to go about like this

00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:21,480
sort of thing that ends like enforcing

00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,800
like those sort of things because those

00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,020
are those are decisions that developers

00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,920
would like to make on their own so we

00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:29,040
definitely don't try to get in the way

00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,090
of that anyway let's go back here and

00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,560
look once this thing gets started

00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:39,210
hopefully our site will be will be there

00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:40,860
it's not so that's great give us another

00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:44,180
shot and then we'll if this doesn't work

00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:46,650
like it'll move move on to other things

00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:48,060
we're just unfortunate but this is like

00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:50,820
a 50-50 thing depending on like how the

00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:52,920
conference Wi-Fi goes like so that would

00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,120
give it a shot but we do it live power

00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,440
bill o'reilly right now I'd be I'd be

00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,650
swearing profusely and throwing things

00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,740
but I'm not him so we're not going to do

00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:09,150
that anyway thank you thing

00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:11,930
sucked yes exactly thank you okay it's

00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:14,430
exactly what I wanted to see very good

00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:15,750
so actually what we can do is like we

00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,670
can actually investigate this problem

00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,110
which because one of the cool things

00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,550
about Kalibak this is like what makes it

00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,230
a little bit different than like MAMP is

00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,520
like we do like setup like stained

00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,870
defaults for you out of the box like we

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,950
have like engine acts and apache and

00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:28,080
like all that or and all that fun stuff

00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,040
set up but you can also ask this h into

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,110
the machine which is what i've done

00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,340
right now and check like everything

00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,600
that's going on like inside of it you

00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:36,510
could want to add new stuff you could do

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,680
that yes thank you I think the problem

00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,210
was that that may be how about just

00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,860
doesn't work if you use a president as

00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,330
like the site name which means that

00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,910
potentially the NSA is watching all of

00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:47,130
us right now so there you go that's me

00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:48,810
my theory for the day anyway here we go

00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:51,240
we have a site that's really awesome we

00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:53,040
can click on it and we have it in the

00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,240
browser welcome to God I don't know what

00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,920
guys I think I was just getting little

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,180
bit nervous I type something in anyway

00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,640
here's your drupal site we spun it up

00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,930
really quickly that's really awesome and

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,970
like we can look into this code directly

00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:05,970
like I was just showing you earlier

00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:09,180
let's see it's in this it'll go into

00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:11,280
your home folder in cala box and it's in

00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:13,740
this ww directory and like here you go

00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,300
like here's all your ear stuff and if

00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,620
you're like me and you like sublime text

00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,690
you can just like totally throw that in

00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:23,610
there and I call your code is there

00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:26,700
which is like really sweet so when

00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:28,960
sublime text loads it will show you that

00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,580
so let's go back to the magic here oh

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,950
there it is like that sorry those are

00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:35,050
your code so i could go in here and like

00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,670
do something like really awesome like

00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,870
say like I'm like oh triple is really

00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:45,420
complicated i just want a static HTML

00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:47,500
site I love conference Wi-Fi so much and

00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,440
we've type that into our local machine

00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,580
we go back here oh poor we go to another

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,750
thing completely I don't want to do that

00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:57,190
sorry we go to back to the site and like

00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,660
boom there we go like we've edited our

00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:01,480
code on another machine it goes into the

00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:03,040
vm and that the magic has happened so

00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,270
that's really good one of the other

00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,410
things really cool is that is the

00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,270
workflow integration I was talking about

00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:09,460
so I'll big setup this this account for

00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,750
myself i'm going to log into pantheon

00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,160
it's going to do it's going to go up and

00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,390
is going to do the magic it's going to

00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,650
get all your sites and like show them on

00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:16,810
your Kalibak so you can download them

00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:18,610
and we're going to feel really confident

00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,930
about the Wi-Fi so we're going to we're

00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:23,440
going to do it again and see if it

00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:26,020
actually works and and risk it risk it

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,160
all and while it's happening while we're

00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,240
downloading this site so i have three

00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,040
sides on pantheon the other oh they just

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,510
showed up we know they're on Pantheon

00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,510
because there's that cloud logo which is

00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:35,470
a matter for of some kind i'm sure and

00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,940
so i have like four I've like three

00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,260
sites here one of them is a social

00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:42,010
coding for good site which we did for a

00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:43,120
non-profit for free and you get these

00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,440
options when you want to download and

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,910
pull aside from cala box which is really

00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,960
sweet you can download we have been

00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,000
optionally so you can download your

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,800
drupal files because sometimes you don't

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,790
really need that and we don't want to

00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,200
have that the enforced because some

00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:55,540
sites have like gigabytes and gigabytes

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,820
of files you can also download whatever

00:25:55,540 --> 00:26:00,340
backup you want create a new one from

00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:02,440
your database so we'll just submit this

00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:06,780
and see what happens we'll roll the dice

00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:08,830
again because you know go big or go home

00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:10,360
anyway so yeah so let's go back to this

00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:12,250
which is that association to this

00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,050
machine and this is like I think we're

00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:16,120
power users can really develop really

00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:17,380
the benefit a lot from cala box which is

00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,790
like it's really easy to set up like

00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,810
we've set some stain defaults for me we

00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,430
set some things that are like pretty

00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,750
normal but now you can go and you can

00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:24,880
add something you can add whatever you

00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:26,260
want so say like you're doing like this

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,080
weird implementation where you need like

00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:30,610
apache ticket to do like PDF indexing or

00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,560
something you can go in here and just do

00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:34,150
your normal like linux stuff and like

00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,520
add ticket in there which is like really

00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:38,020
awesome and all your sites are in there

00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,460
like you can see the sights happening

00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,910
right there you can also see that like

00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,380
the social

00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:43,960
for good site is being downloaded right

00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,850
now which is good news based on previous

00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,220
experience in the last 15 minutes and

00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:49,600
you have all the power like you can do

00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,100
whatever you want look you are logged in

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,480
as like a pseudo user you can like

00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,760
change this around it whatever possible

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,290
way and the nice thing about it is like

00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,520
all this stuff is actually in virtualbox

00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:59,320
so if you like how to a specific

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,550
configuration you could just export it

00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:04,620
and save it and use it later if you

00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:06,370
wanted to which is really nice so that's

00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,740
that's the one of the really awesome

00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:10,060
things about cala boxes it's for novices

00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:12,820
and for pros which i think is super

00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,930
awesome and one that's when the site is

00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,790
downloaded will show you a couple of the

00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:16,930
more magics and then we'll move on to to

00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:22,480
the other things that are even more

00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:23,920
magical and let's see and we can change

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,780
this back to the normal drupal's while

00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:29,490
we're waiting because that's what this

00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:31,510
conference is for so I've done that and

00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,160
there we go I've got normal Drupal back

00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,810
and you can go in here and you can look

00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,950
you can see that like the databases in

00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,150
here so if you're like the kind of

00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:40,510
person who likes to go in and just like

00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:46,870
edit databases for fun you can go in and

00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:47,830
do that so there we go yeah so we'll

00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,300
wait we'll wait for this site to

00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,080
download this like a panoply sites it's

00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,640
a little bit bigger than just like

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,080
normal Drupal but let's continue on the

00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:58,840
presentation we can return to that a

00:27:53,080 --> 00:28:01,240
later time umm anyway yeah so Calla box

00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,380
is free we made it free we wanted to be

00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,150
free we thought that it was a great tool

00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,370
for people to use we didn't want it to

00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:08,590
be proprietary one to be out there for

00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:10,210
everyone to try and it's been like in a

00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,650
prototype stage for quite a while now we

00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:13,060
have over a thousand people using it

00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:14,290
there are people Arizona State

00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,460
University using it there are people

00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,930
have to congressional budget office

00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,610
using it there are people out political

00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:21,220
using it and they're all having a great

00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:23,350
time with it and I've gone around like a

00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:25,840
lot of camps in the last year talking

00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:27,850
about it and like hearing a lot of

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,230
people a lot of people's feedback and

00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,370
getting their they're kind of comments

00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:33,550
on it and like what we could do to make

00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:35,650
it better and we already think that we

00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:37,570
already think that um you know that

00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:39,310
Khalid box is like the best thing that

00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,420
out there like by far I mean there's no

00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,650
there's nothing else that really does

00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,870
this in like the kind of way that this

00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:45,520
step is that this does like nothing else

00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,930
is like really really easy to use is

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,130
like a legitimate web server that you

00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,180
can interact with in the way that you're

00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:51,730
familiar and the way that makes sense

00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:53,539
that has relative production parody and

00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,919
has workflow integration

00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:58,639
like the other platform tools that you

00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:59,899
use that being said there's a lot of

00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:02,450
really interesting tech that's come out

00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:04,220
lately and we're really interested in

00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,929
like doing a lot more with Calla box and

00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,159
I'm going to talk to you a little bit

00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:08,450
more about that right now like what

00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:11,200
things we can do in the future to make

00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:13,609
this even better than it already is and

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,279
what that means in like short terms is

00:29:13,609 --> 00:29:17,570
this better faster stronger but I want

00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:19,369
to get into specifics as to what that

00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:20,479
really means like both from a technical

00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:22,279
perspective and what that's going to

00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:24,139
mean for like individuals and Drupal

00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:25,039
shops to help solve your problems

00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:27,259
because of the end of the day that's

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,249
like what this is all about so one of

00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:29,509
the things we really want to do with

00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:31,849
Calla box is we want to provide a

00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:33,739
platform api right now Cal box only

00:29:31,849 --> 00:29:35,599
works with Pantheon which is which is

00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:38,749
great and it works that way because we

00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:40,369
use Pantheon at kalamita but there's a

00:29:38,749 --> 00:29:42,109
lot of other people who want to use cala

00:29:40,369 --> 00:29:43,849
box but can't because they use other

00:29:42,109 --> 00:29:46,279
things like these things for example

00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:48,409
aqueon Egger and Everdene cloud and

00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:49,549
digital ocean and things like that so

00:29:48,409 --> 00:29:51,889
one of the things we really want to do

00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:53,960
is provide an API for people to write

00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:55,639
plugins for their own platforms the

00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,320
platforms out there using and this is

00:29:55,639 --> 00:29:58,970
made possible by an open-source

00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,470
technology called switch board which is

00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,789
being developed right now by John pack

00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,830
who is sitting over there in the green

00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:05,720
shirt and has the amazing amazing beard

00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:08,659
do not talk on it if you see him but

00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,039
we'll make him very angry or he might

00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:12,529
smile I mean you could roll the dice on

00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:13,820
that one too but anyway we want to be

00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:15,259
able to provide integration for all

00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,429
these things and not just for platform

00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:18,470
providers but for other things as well

00:30:16,429 --> 00:30:19,789
for example like a lot of people do

00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:21,950
continuous integration and continuous

00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:23,479
delivery so how great would it be for

00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:25,129
you to develop locally with the team on

00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:26,929
Calla box and to be able to push what

00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:29,119
you've done through get up to some sort

00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:31,159
of continuous integration server jenkins

00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,940
is the obvious example like those kinds

00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:33,590
of things could be really really

00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,789
powerful and really really easy to set

00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:37,369
up and you won't have to waste a ton of

00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:39,559
time one of the other really cool things

00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:40,820
is being able to just like if you're a

00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:42,229
novice user who doesn't really

00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,389
understand a lot about any of these

00:30:42,229 --> 00:30:46,759
things being able to download Calla box

00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:48,379
install it you know it's all a drupal

00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:50,299
site build the drupal site really easily

00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:52,549
and then just to deploy it to whatever

00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:54,019
you want all of the UI you don't have to

00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:55,759
know what any of these tools are and

00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:58,190
that's really really important because

00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:59,479
Drupal is difficult and I don't know if

00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,830
any of you have looked around lately but

00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:03,109
I haven't seen anyone who's below the

00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:04,909
age of 24 in here and I think that's a

00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:06,919
problem and one of the problems is

00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:07,340
because that they're a lot of the other

00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:08,600
technol

00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,280
out there right now like ruby on rails

00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,050
and stuff like that are really easy to

00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,990
use and they're fun and exciting to use

00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:16,130
and drupal is 10 years old and we need

00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:18,560
to bring more people into the ecosystem

00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:20,150
and what that means is that we need to

00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,830
provide tools that enable that from

00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:23,600
happening and I think that we all get

00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,920
stuck in our own little space and drupal

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,930
and we forget that there's people

00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,310
outside of us lots of people lots of

00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:29,480
people who'd you could who want to use

00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:32,150
Drupal and would use your bullet they

00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,590
could so what we want to do is to help

00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:35,210
make that happen and I think this is a

00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,950
big step forward it's like open up the

00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,240
space and let cow blocks work with more

00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,350
things we can bring more people into the

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,690
ecosystem because ultimately that's

00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:45,980
going to be why we exist succeed or fail

00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,510
the other really really really exciting

00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,700
thing that we want to do for cattle

00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:50,960
boxes switch it to use docker i'm not

00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,970
sure if anyone anyone here was familiar

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,520
with docker it's just really cool tool

00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:56,660
that is kind of on top of like LXE

00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,710
container technology which you've

00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,780
probably heard a lot about during this

00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:01,790
conference already it's really really

00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:03,620
exciting it's so good that's not even in

00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:05,330
production and companies like openshift

00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,680
I think or OpenStack or something are

00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,820
actually using it regardless of the

00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:11,420
warnings that are plastered all over

00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:13,130
talkers github page and what this means

00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:14,450
for Kalibak is going to be way way way

00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:17,510
way faster than a proof of this was

00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:19,280
before which is really awesome what also

00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:20,630
means is not gonna have one website per

00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,480
server which is really really exciting

00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:26,810
as well the thing that's most powerful

00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,550
about this is because docker is like is

00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,780
what it is which is a containerized

00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:32,030
system where you can move things around

00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,990
really easily now you can think of a

00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,790
whole kind of thing where you have

00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:38,180
plugins for Cal abox and you can have

00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:39,470
whatever web server you want so if you

00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:41,570
don't like the stuff that comes with

00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:45,950
Paulo box if you run like Apache and

00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:49,160
Maria DB or if you run you know varnish

00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:51,320
and engine X and Redis and all that

00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,240
other stuff you can build your own

00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,890
containers and docker and you can import

00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,480
them into Calla box and what that means

00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:59,270
is that anyone here who has a

00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,030
development team and has existing tools

00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:03,590
all you need to be able to do is move

00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,810
them into docker containers and now you

00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:07,010
can put Kal box on top of it which is

00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:09,050
really really exciting because what that

00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:10,310
means is that now you're like head of

00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,450
engineering is the only person who

00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,730
really has to deal with that sort of

00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:16,850
stuff and you can easily deploy your

00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:18,650
like custom environment to all the

00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:20,120
people who are on your team which is

00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:22,380
really really really power

00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,910
so you can use your existing tools which

00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,350
is awesome right now like if you have

00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:28,950
cala box like you have to go into the

00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:30,810
actual p.m. and you know do the stuff i

00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:33,030
was showing you before like ssh in and

00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:34,110
like add stuff that way but this way you

00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,400
can have standardized environment and

00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,690
you can deploy our cross multiple teams

00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,600
you can on board people really quickly

00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:41,460
which is awesome the other thing we want

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,900
to do is provide support for windows

00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,280
we've got like I've definitely got

00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,200
around the country a lot this year and

00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,180
people are like Hollow box is super

00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,340
awesome I want to be able to use it I

00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:53,400
want to standardize on it but people all

00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:57,810
my team use windows and I'm like that's

00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:59,460
sad but that being said there are tons

00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,720
of people on Windows who like want to be

00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,090
more engaged in the Drupal community and

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,890
we make it really hard for them and

00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:06,060
that's unfortunate as well so one of the

00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:07,110
things we really really want to do is we

00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,790
want to bring windows support for

00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:11,010
catalogs so that people in Windows can

00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:13,590
now use this thing and now you can have

00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,760
a development team that uses one local

00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,409
development solution one integrated

00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,669
workflow solution not a bunch of them

00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:19,919
which is also really powerful for

00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:21,030
obvious reasons so Windows support is

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:23,810
super important we want to make that

00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:29,159
happen we want to bring that to cala box

00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:30,690
it already works on linux uh we yeah

00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,649
yeah it already actually if you if you

00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:33,060
like download the just a note

00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:35,850
application by itself like it'll work

00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:37,890
it'll work on linux right now so it's

00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:40,140
not documented but it will well yes we

00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:42,030
are going to do that as well and this is

00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:45,780
the big thing right now cala box is free

00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:47,669
but it's not open source we want to make

00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:49,860
it open source we want to put it out

00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:51,179
there and we want to the glue of the

00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,070
community to drive its growth going

00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:54,300
forward because it's really important

00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:57,149
for us to converge on a common standard

00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,530
here and by common standard I don't mean

00:34:57,149 --> 00:35:00,300
that Kalibak should replace what you're

00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:02,280
using I think that Kalibak should enable

00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,750
what you're using all the tools that you

00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,730
already have Kalibak skin like be

00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:07,740
surfaced on top of that and we can all

00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:09,570
manage it together callum una has been

00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:12,330
doing this like by ourselves for a

00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:13,530
couple of years now and we've gone it to

00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,640
a point where like people are excited

00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:16,770
about it I think there's definitely a

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,920
space for it as Matt mentioned like

00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:21,570
ma'am is a dinosaur and this uses

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,580
technologies that are like very very new

00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,990
and we want everyone to be able to use

00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,970
them and we should all develop them

00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,530
together so we want to make cala box

00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:30,990
open source so we can drive the

00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:32,490
development going forward and i think

00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:36,270
that that's really really important

00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:37,410
so if you're a visual learner this is

00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:39,540
kind of what Kalibak looks like now

00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:41,940
which is this kind of complicated thing

00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:44,970
you have these like very very immutable

00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:47,520
objects a lot of moving parts not a lot

00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:50,310
of integration and everything kind of

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,240
sits on this callous tack thing and this

00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:53,580
is what we want to look like in the

00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,830
future which that will work on any

00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:57,840
operating system it'll have like a very

00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:59,220
small vm and then you can build

00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,570
basically whatever sort of web server

00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,710
you want inside of it based on this

00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,540
plug-in system that I was telling you

00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:08,240
about and you can integrate with

00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:10,200
whatever sort of stuff you want to so I

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,210
don't know about you but that sounds

00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,910
like basically exactly what we all

00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:15,810
should be doing and I think that it

00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:19,710
makes all the things that are out there

00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:20,820
look kind of like a joke so this is this

00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,880
is what we should be doing and we all

00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:27,330
should be doing it together so what will

00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,500
it take to make this happen well the

00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:30,750
good thing about it is we already have

00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,369
the tools we already have the talent and

00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:33,450
we actually have a plan to make this

00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:35,340
happen and it's actually starting to

00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,750
happen right now what we really need to

00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:38,880
take it to the next level is community

00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:41,730
support which means support from all of

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,770
you and that can be development support

00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:45,240
other kinds of support word of mouth

00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:47,970
getting the word out there talking about

00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,890
this thing using it on your teeth using

00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:53,550
it with your teams like using it by

00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:54,690
yourself all sorts of stuff and if we

00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,640
can all do this if we can make this

00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,900
vision possible what this will mean is

00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,900
that will solve the local development

00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,490
problem and that it will be part of the

00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,869
community the community will be the one

00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,910
who is responsible for managing and

00:37:03,869 --> 00:37:07,320
going forward it won't be us it won't be

00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:09,780
any one company with some proprietary

00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:11,670
solution it will be a community-driven

00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:14,640
solution which is I think what triple is

00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:15,869
supposed to be all about so that's

00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,690
really powerful and that's what we want

00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:20,340
to do the other thing that this means is

00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:22,140
like you can level up all your internal

00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:25,800
teams like you don't have to use you can

00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:27,720
keep your existing tools but you can use

00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,660
Calla box and even on board developers

00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,490
super fast and you can deploy it to

00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:34,590
everyone which is really awesome and

00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:36,240
this will save you tons of time and if

00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:37,470
you're a shop owner or the leader of a

00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,560
development team in here I don't think I

00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:42,090
need to explain what that means and more

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,250
importantly as I mentioned before we had

00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:45,680
to open the door to new users news there

00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:48,200
any more people involved in true

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,750
and the things like Cal box can make

00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,099
that happen even really great tools that

00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:54,230
are out there level you spin up sites

00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:55,940
you know in the cloud you still need to

00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,260
know about SFTP and get and stuff like

00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,030
that to make it happen with Calla box

00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,470
you don't all you have to do is download

00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,849
it people are familiar with downloading

00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:04,369
things you can install it it's easy to

00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:05,329
install Drupal as you saw before and you

00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:07,430
can just kind of roll with that which is

00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:09,079
awesome so that's what this all means

00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:10,309
and I think this is really really

00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:13,819
exciting I think that we should all do

00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:15,680
this and you should all help us do it so

00:38:13,819 --> 00:38:18,950
what I want to do the day right now is

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,950
talk about this vision and how to make

00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:22,940
it happen and if you go to this website

00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:24,859
you'll see that we've started a

00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:26,300
Kickstarter which i think is the first

00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:29,059
Kickstarter that has happened in triple

00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,079
to support something like this and I

00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:31,819
would encourage you to go to this page

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,140
and to donate to the Kickstarter

00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:35,599
campaign to help make this vision

00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:36,800
possible and if we can get the 23

00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,770
thousand dollars will make all this

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,140
stuff open source and we will definitely

00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:43,369
and I think that would be a big win for

00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:46,760
the entire community which is going to

00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:48,260
be really really awesome so please come

00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,690
to the site please go to the the link

00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:53,569
here and help us build this thing I

00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:55,250
think is gonna be really exciting and

00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:56,869
let's make this the thing to use let's

00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,640
like fine is standard it's like let's do

00:38:56,869 --> 00:39:02,660
this let's not like do map anymore

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:04,010
because it's embarrassing anyway thank

00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:07,130
you actually let's go back and see if

00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:08,540
there's like that this site is oh there

00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,970
we go so yeah here's our site from

00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:12,200
Pantheon that we were doing earlier and

00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:14,569
you can load it up it'll load on your

00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:17,510
browser really quickly and you can also

00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:18,710
see really quickly as well that you have

00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,940
this nice stuff you can remove it but

00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,470
you could also go on there and refresh

00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,630
it so if someone is like provided like

00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:24,799
new code to your development environment

00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:26,000
you know you can grab that new code you

00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:28,780
can grab new database you can grab new

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:34,130
files really easily which is really cool

00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:35,450
so that's all the magic and I think we

00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:38,119
have like 15 minutes left so maybe we

00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:39,440
can take some some of the questions I we

00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:41,359
could definitely take some questions but

00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,710
I think in general like these are the

00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,270
kinds of problems that I think it's

00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:45,799
really awesome people are solving and

00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:47,089
there's different ways to resource and

00:39:45,799 --> 00:39:49,010
support and make these kinds of things

00:39:47,089 --> 00:39:50,900
happen but that having these kinds of

00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:52,520
tools out there and having these kinds

00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,470
of technologies came really important

00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,119
and so what what what Mike showing you

00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:58,400
you can download right now play around

00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:58,750
with on your Mac and I give feedback on

00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,250
that

00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,450
there's also obviously the 2 point 0

00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:03,430
vision that you can support and

00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:05,050
otherwise just get involved with but I

00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,970
think it's nice to see innovation and I

00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:08,590
niestety stuff happening and if folks

00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:10,960
have questions about about the plan the

00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:14,140
project the technology Houseman stuff is

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,180
using there's some microphones there at

00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:18,430
least or you can yell it out I'll repeat

00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:20,140
it for the recording so also we can do

00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:21,970
some little QA we have like we have like

00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:24,400
30 8 backers right now so we did a

00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:26,830
Kickstarter like like 30 hours ago we

00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,150
already have 38 backers if we get to 100

00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:30,550
before dribble con is over we will

00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:32,320
release a version of talla box 10 which

00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:33,940
you can download right now for free that

00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,990
has Drupal 8 in it so people who are

00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,030
like working on Drupal 8 can have

00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:40,810
something to spin up really quickly so

00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:42,340
that's just an FYI for probably guys um

00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:44,410
so yeah let's let's ask a few questions

00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:47,470
talk about the process and I'm just see

00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:50,200
how people feel in the front so I was

00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:53,350
just a little unclear on one thing as

00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:56,410
far as your code base and the files sure

00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:58,960
are those is being downloaded to the

00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:01,210
local machine and then linked in to the

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,830
virtual machine or they on the Virtual

00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:04,300
Machine then linked back to the local

00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:06,040
machine yeah so although all the files

00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,480
and code and database that you have all

00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,830
that gone pantheon right now or actually

00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,660
downloaded to the virtual machine and

00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:11,980
then they're shared through all your

00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,240
code is shared through to your actual

00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,670
host machine which in this case is that

00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:17,440
is the mac okay okay well your database

00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:18,880
and your files that's all in the vm we

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,670
recently did it in vagrant the other

00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,980
direction and managed to get it to work

00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:25,960
on Windows and Mac but it was a little

00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:27,610
crazy right so in the in the kallah box

00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,810
to division we're actually going to not

00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,430
use vagrant we're going to use the boot

00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:32,080
to dock or CLI which has a lot of really

00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:33,310
cool stuff in there and one of the

00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,540
people who's working on Kalabagh his

00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,620
name is James Halliday you might know

00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,850
him as sub stack and then nodejs

00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:38,410
community he wrote this really cool

00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:41,170
thing that's similar to the auto rsync

00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:42,460
thing that happens in Vegas and we're

00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:44,380
going to be using something like that to

00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:47,230
manage files in between like the docker

00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:49,630
containers and the host machine it's

00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:53,310
actually what we want with ya oh cool

00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:58,000
thank you yeah thank you awesome next up

00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:59,890
hello I regarding vagrant how hard is it

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,190
to integrate your own vagrant files if

00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:06,460
you already have them if your your vm

00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:08,290
setup is not just plain vanilla what do

00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:09,910
you mean by integrate like can i

00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:12,100
download it and then say instead of

00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:15,250
using whatever the vagrant files

00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:16,840
you have written your chance Ted yeah

00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:18,520
yeah so there's a there's a there's

00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,050
actually a configuration file you can

00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,370
provide your own default we can provide

00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:24,190
your own configure of a configuration

00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:26,440
file for like our vagrant file if you go

00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:28,180
to like the callus tak repository on

00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,740
github you'll see you'll see where that

00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:32,260
is and you can edit it and use that if

00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:36,870
you want to as well so yeah there's lots

00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:36,870
of things you can configure thanks cool

00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,680
SoCal abox 1 point 0 is you know

00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:43,030
fantastic for individual developers in

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,830
which you can you know work on a local

00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:47,320
site you know start you push it up to

00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:49,090
Pantheon and so forth with cal box to

00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,500
point o what kind of team oriented

00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:52,090
options are and especially if you have

00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:54,850
like multiple people who are working on

00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:56,470
the same project the same code base is

00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:58,510
there any is there going to be any kind

00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:00,520
of mechanism where you can say deploy a

00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:02,800
particular Kalibak scanned configuration

00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,030
that everybody on the team can use yeah

00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,470
sure so this is one of the main reasons

00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:07,750
why we moved to the dock or a kind of

00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:09,220
situation which is that if we're having

00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:11,380
doc if we have dr. we have a plug-in

00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,880
system then if you're like the leader if

00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,020
you're leading like a development team

00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,300
or you're the engineer who's providing

00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:17,770
like all the IT for it you can write

00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,510
your own docker containers that you need

00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:20,680
specifically for that project when

00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,300
whether that matches your production

00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,310
server or whether that's like an

00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,660
internal tool that you guys use anything

00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:27,850
that can be put into a docker container

00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:29,170
can be used on catalogs now which is

00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:30,520
really really powerful so you can you

00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:32,170
can you can do that you can deploy it to

00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,340
all the people on your team you can have

00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:34,870
multiple ones of them if you want as

00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:36,550
well you can start with vagrant if you

00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:37,990
want to anything that can be put into a

00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:40,660
docker container can be used with

00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:41,830
Kalibak so any version control any

00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,960
configurate management system you want

00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:49,330
to use all that stuff so it's really

00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:51,220
really powerful cool yeah with 10 how

00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:53,710
can you do your own like custom profiles

00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:56,170
to it is it possible um what do you mean

00:43:53,710 --> 00:44:01,900
exactly by custom profiles if I had my

00:43:56,170 --> 00:44:03,820
own drupal profile on around sure

00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:06,400
actually if you go to the Kickstarter

00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:07,660
page one of the one of the prize levels

00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,010
is that will ship you like a custom

00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:10,600
version of cala box when it comes out

00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:13,270
that has your custom distribution is

00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,710
built into it um but because yeah

00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:16,330
because Cal box because we want to make

00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:18,430
Calla box open source if we hit our goal

00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:20,410
like you'll be able to go in and you'll

00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:22,330
be able to easily see where the

00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:24,130
distributions are specified in cala box

00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:25,029
so you could just add your own on to

00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:26,469
that and compile the

00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:28,599
whole thing and have your own custom

00:44:26,469 --> 00:44:29,919
version so you can use whatever whatever

00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:31,209
distribution like whatever your custom

00:44:29,919 --> 00:44:33,069
distribution is with triple you can you

00:44:31,209 --> 00:44:34,809
can use but that's in the 20 not the one

00:44:33,069 --> 00:44:37,569
that'll be in the 20 yeah okay the 10

00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:40,239
the 10 actually work an open source at

00:44:37,569 --> 00:44:41,559
as well once we hit the goal so you can

00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:45,239
actually go in and do that as well so

00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:45,239
you can do that you can do that for that

00:44:45,779 --> 00:44:52,509
hi hi I just wanted a second the linux

00:44:50,859 --> 00:44:53,949
version okay we can run the nodejs

00:44:52,509 --> 00:44:56,439
version but it's you're going to be a

00:44:53,949 --> 00:44:57,729
part of the kickstarter goal or just to

00:44:56,439 --> 00:44:59,469
have it yeah I can't reversion yeah

00:44:57,729 --> 00:45:00,969
definitely the nice thing about so we're

00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:03,579
gonna be using the boot to dock or CLI

00:45:00,969 --> 00:45:04,479
which is cross-platform so I think that

00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:06,099
with the work that we've already done I

00:45:04,479 --> 00:45:09,069
think that it actually almost almost

00:45:06,099 --> 00:45:10,569
almost works on linux right now anyway

00:45:09,069 --> 00:45:12,880
so yeah we're gonna we're going to do

00:45:10,569 --> 00:45:14,799
that definitely yeah and then i have a

00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,749
second question have you heard of or

00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:20,890
worked with the proviso project yeah so

00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:22,179
yeah definitely app provides was a

00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:23,679
really really sweet project and actually

00:45:22,179 --> 00:45:25,059
came out of a conversation that that

00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,579
cali muna had a bunch of other companies

00:45:25,059 --> 00:45:29,409
had zip tech and like my planet digital

00:45:27,579 --> 00:45:31,239
and some other people at the last Triple

00:45:29,409 --> 00:45:33,309
khan and there was a lot of momentum to

00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:35,049
it and i think that the proviso project

00:45:33,309 --> 00:45:36,880
can still happen and should still happen

00:45:35,049 --> 00:45:38,439
and all the stuff that happens from that

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,689
can still be X can be exported into

00:45:38,439 --> 00:45:41,650
docker containers input into Cala box so

00:45:40,689 --> 00:45:43,299
I don't think they're competing visions

00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:44,799
I think that there that there's a lot of

00:45:43,299 --> 00:45:46,989
mutual benefit from from both of them

00:45:44,799 --> 00:45:48,249
happening at the same time okay but the

00:45:46,989 --> 00:45:49,689
project provides the browser project is

00:45:48,249 --> 00:45:50,739
really great and if people aren't

00:45:49,689 --> 00:45:54,309
arrestin checking it out I suggest that

00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:55,839
you guys it's really really awesome who

00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:57,489
want to other questions any other US

00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:01,390
history questions presents questions

00:45:57,489 --> 00:46:03,159
sighs questions so what happens if you

00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:04,779
don't succeed with your fun and goal

00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:06,939
because I know what Kickstarter it's

00:46:04,779 --> 00:46:08,140
like it all or nothing it isn't all or

00:46:06,939 --> 00:46:09,729
nothing I think that we're pretty

00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,679
confident we will succeed otherwise you

00:46:09,729 --> 00:46:12,729
wouldn't have done this but if we don't

00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:14,169
succeed then I guess you can have fun

00:46:12,729 --> 00:46:21,209
with map for the rest of your life yeah

00:46:14,169 --> 00:46:21,209
fair enough sorry boss the answer i have

00:46:22,259 --> 00:46:27,219
um we probably probably probably would

00:46:25,509 --> 00:46:28,329
but it's on like one of the one of the

00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:30,369
things we want to do is we want to get

00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:31,779
so you can open source something and

00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:33,759
then you can take a on the internet

00:46:31,779 --> 00:46:35,229
you know and right now we want to open

00:46:33,759 --> 00:46:37,599
source something that is like easy to

00:46:35,229 --> 00:46:38,060
use and is like logical and people and

00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:39,260
people can

00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,250
see it and they're like oh I understand

00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:43,490
how this works I understand how to

00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:45,800
contribute to it and you know Kalibak is

00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:48,320
one is a prototype we built it you know

00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,610
just to kind of do a proof of concept so

00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,960
we can open source it but whether

00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:52,760
anything happens with it I don't I don't

00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,930
know you know and that's like why we

00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,340
want to do the 2 dot out we want to

00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:56,960
build it in a way so the community can

00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,640
really plug into it and like develop it

00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:04,790
really well and take it like further

00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:07,070
down the road I um does this depend on a

00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:10,580
constant internet connection like what

00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:12,800
if you have to work offline sometimes

00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:14,420
sure yeah definitely I mean I fly around

00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,290
a lot so like not having an internet

00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:17,420
connection is something that I'm

00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:18,800
familiar with so you'll definitely need

00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:20,240
an internet connection to install it and

00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,650
to like do your workflow operations with

00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,570
platform providers but once that's gone

00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:24,560
once once you have your site locally

00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:25,820
like you don't need an internet

00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:30,980
connection to like actually work on your

00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:32,930
code hi hey what's up what's up man so

00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:34,400
one question about the new the new

00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:37,370
vision for two point oh the curator

00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,410
modeled using docker what's your thought

00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:42,470
about environment parity at that point

00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:45,230
since I mean if you're only talking

00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:47,270
about pantheon fine but when you're

00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:49,100
talking about other other hosts that

00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:51,050
aren't using that same model what's

00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:54,530
what's the consideration there throw it

00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:55,850
all in one container or for parity you

00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:57,110
know like say aqua environment or

00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:58,250
something else sure so the way that

00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:00,020
we're going to write the plug-in system

00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,880
is actually we're going to have it set

00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:04,400
up so you can specify if you want to put

00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,450
everything into if you want to put

00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,210
everything into one container if you

00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:09,230
want reticent solar and apache and my

00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:11,540
sequel to be in one container you

00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:12,530
certainly can do that but if you want to

00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,850
have all those things in different

00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:15,260
containers talking to each other which

00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:17,240
is like probably a better model of a lot

00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:20,180
of a lot of cloud providers like systems

00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,650
you can do that as well and we're we

00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:23,900
basically are we've written the plugin

00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:25,460
for pantheon because we use pantheon but

00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,810
we wanted to build the api so other

00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:30,050
people can provide plugins that make

00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:31,520
sense for them however like there is a

00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:33,890
kickstarter level beyond the minimum

00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:36,500
which if met means that we will provide

00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:37,880
like relatively good mock-ups of like

00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,320
the aqua environment and the Aberdeen

00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,180
cloud environment for you guys to use

00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,350
just right out of the box well that's

00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,460
going to be that's going to depend on

00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:48,290
them on what we can raise in the

00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:50,990
Kickstarter anything else now do you

00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:52,280
have any questions no but um I mean if

00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:53,660
you don't meet the funding goal and this

00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,310
code needs to be on the internet I'm

00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:58,520
sure sure something will show up on

00:48:55,310 --> 00:49:00,050
pastebin before uh for everyone who

00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,480
wants to play around with it cuz coach

00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:04,160
be free would you be free but no I

00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,840
everyone I think thanks everyone for

00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,610
coming out checking out this tech like

00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:09,230
Aereo it's really exciting to try to do

00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:10,910
cool stuff in Drupal it's awesome to see

00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:12,890
Cal box it's awesome to see people try

00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:15,020
to solve local dev and hopefully

00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:16,460
everybody has a great fabulous time the

00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:18,470
rest of the conference doing the things

00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:20,660
you love talking to your friends so go

00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:23,930

and after you leave here go and tell 10

00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,650
people about this because it going to

00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,660
make all of our lives easier and it's

00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:35,680
really important that it happens if you

00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:35,680
