Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: DEAR EDTECH, ELMSLN IS HERE AND IT WANTS TO REPLACE YOUR VENDORS.
Publication date: 2014-06-04
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014

	Speakers: btopro
PRESENTATION TRAILER NOW AVAILABLE!

This summer.. Coming to a server near you... ELMS...

LET'S DO THIS!

I am one of many Drupal developers in the educational technology space and I have a message for you. Tired of half-baked, closed source solutions with massive support contracts? Education doesn't have to have its hands tied by technological complacency.

The time is now to replace old ways of thinking, and the approach is here. In this presentation I will discuss and demonstrate the latest ELMS initiative known as ELMS Learning Network (ELMSLN). ELMSLN is a distro-of-distros package built using primarily (but not limited to) Drupal (Piwik is in there too for example).

This ain't your Drupal 6 ELMS distro. This is a series of distributions that use Restful APIs (RestWS) and a simple, repeatable pattern for the automated building of new Drupal sites. Think Aegir meets edtech while aligning more with the needs of education. To visualize what I'm describing:

Watch "ELMSLN doodles: Understanding ELMSLN"
Read ELMSLN Philosophy/Theory
Using a combination of Galaxy packaging specification, DSLM, a bunch of automation (thanks drush!), and the ELMS CIS distribution, ELMSLN is able to rapidly produce new course tools. These tools then are connected via web services to form a network-based approach to learning management system design. Imagine deploying a system for use in a course at a new web address, then equate that to one Drupal distribution. Now, just keep doing it over the life-cycle of systems development, each new system being a new address containing a multi-site of a different distro.

Stitch it together with JSON, single sign-on and OAuth based standards like Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) and you've got a highly flexible, while still very usable, networked LMS. Completely manageable by small teams, and consistently more powerful then what any one vendor can provide via closed systems.

To quote @kreynen that suggested I submit this by the following title..

okay it's 345 which means the witching

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,660
hour is upon us so welcome those of you

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,830
were able to make it to the door I know

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,030
there's like a million people here I'm

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,350
going to be abusing this quite

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,490
frequently because it's recorded and

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,090
can't see how many people are actually

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:23,130
in the room so I i did a trailer of this

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,289
talk did anyone see the trailer ahead of

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,730
time couple hands went up I apologize in

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,199
advance the jokes are exactly the same

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,750
and it's actually a two-minute long talk

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,000
the entire time so first of all before I

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,340
get started I just want to give a plug

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,160
for drupalcamp PA it's in Pittsburgh

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,410
it's August second and the third it's a

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,480
bridging of higher education and

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,530
Industry as our theme this year so it's

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,559
the first year we're getting it off the

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,000
ground it's a collaboration of a bunch

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,950
of companies and people who live in

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,350
Pittsburgh area and universities in

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,149
Pittsburgh area and Penn State Drupal

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,190
users group so it should be pretty

00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:00,329
awesome it's hosted at pitt university

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:02,730
so i highly recommend it so who am i I'm

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:05,070
at PTO pro as my new name is apparently

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,640
i've been a drupal developer for seven

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,170
years now i have way too many commits to

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,420
do a lot of them in the middle of the

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,939
night because I young kids and I can't

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,009
sleep sometimes and some of the more

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:20,520
popular modules I have our profiler

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,720
builder outline designer tiny nav these

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,000
are meaningless words unless you know

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,619
what they are I guess and it's my job to

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,200
constantly automate my job out of

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,240
existence as I view it so I get bored

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,799
very easily and I want other people to

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,470
get bored with what they're doing now so

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,659
they can automate that away so what's

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,090
actually in a title let's look at the

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,590
case study track requirements so these

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,840
are the three criteria by which

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,479
something would be selected to be up

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,579
here today the words that immediately

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,619
stood out to me were new grounds

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:53,369
redefining what's possible common

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:54,750
problems and failure so let's start with

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,350
a failure title I like to leave with my

00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,240
mistakes Elms Learning Network it's more

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,270
than just reverse engineered open atrium

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,630
with a bad theme because that's

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,690
basically what Elms Drupal 6 was if we

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:13,120
go through roadmap I consider Drupal 6

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:16,239
Elms a complete failure a learning prep

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,129
practice but a failure largely it was

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,140
one system much like open atrium you

00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:21,610
have lots of organic groups one big

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,280
system what could ever go wrong with one

00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,080
big system it's like every major LMS

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,620
it's out there already is the same

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,989
structure so kind of pinging through our

00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,299
history a little bit we made the outline

00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:36,790
designer in 2008 I tried to present it

00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:38,440
at drupalcon Boston and they said its

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,980
proprietary what are you doing here and

00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,970
I said oops I didn't know that so we

00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,030
went through the process of getting

00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,530
things GPL license so we're allowed to

00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,410
contribute everything we do from that

00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,109
point forward we want an award in 2010

00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,040
for something called the open studio in

00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:57,220
2011 for something called Eagle Eye

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,989
media open studio is for students

00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:02,019
collaborating and submitting images to

00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:03,909
each other and talking via chat and

00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:05,829
stuff like that eli media is an asset

00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:08,010
management system in drupal that we

00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:11,079
embed our videos and images in courses

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:13,720
then there was Elms Drupal 6 which is

00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:16,239
kind of a flat line towards a I learned

00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,519
a lot but I wouldn't recommend it at

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,760
this point because it is triple six and

00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,250
while we're way beyond or the six now

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,810
and then there's epic breakthrough is

00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,220
the arrow burst out there i had the

00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,299
graphic designers spend a lot of time on

00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:32,230
epic breakthrough and all that gets an

00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:34,180
arrow so let's uh go with the redefining

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,220
what's possible title but i am often

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:40,030
told i'm way too preachy so this is the

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:44,949
preachy title this summer coming to a

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:47,349
server near you oh we're not selling a

00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:52,389
product we're building a platform for a

00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:55,840
hashtag EdTech revolution at crane in so

00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:57,400
that one was yet yeah it's like way too

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,199
preachy but that's usually what I'm

00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,959
known for is just like ridiculousness at

00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,489
this point um so Kevin rainin gave me

00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,290
that title he's actually the only reason

00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:06,760
I'm here is because at the deadline he

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,260
was like oh you should totally submit a

00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,919
session it's like no I don't ever get

00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:14,590
accepted so the next one is new grounds

00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,870
which made me think of this and I really

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,690
wanted to waste our graphic designers

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,909
time some more and then I landed on

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:25,360
common problems and a common problem if

00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:26,920
you'd ever and having was vendors so

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,770
basically it's still

00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,840
letting extremely preachy title um so

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,610
the agenda for today is how to get

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,830
involved with the project what the

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,180
project is is I'm sure many of you are

00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,170
here if you've seen me even if you've

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,970
heard anything about it you're probably

00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:42,790
still like what the hell is he talking

00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:45,280
about Elms versus Elms Ln because they

00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:47,200
are two different things a philosophy of

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,880
design discussion because a lot of this

00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,370
is a lot more the way in which you

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,410
structure and build and deploy a system

00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,690
as opposed to necessarily what that

00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,600
system is 10 years from now Penn State

00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:01,510
will most likely be here hope so your

00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,560
institutions will all be here I don't

00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,390
know what your app will be like 10 years

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,010
from now but yet we're on a trajectory

00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,030
currently we're putting things in Drupal

00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,650
so we better have a pretty good

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,770
philosophy of design and methodology

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:14,410
planning a platform tour and

00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:17,800
question-and-answer so skipping ahead

00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:19,330
you have devices there's Elms Ln org

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,040
which I'm announcing today I finally

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:25,090
have started to consolidate some of

00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:28,600
these thoughts places it's all things

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:31,000
about the project there's a pil mozilla

00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,590
org as well which is a full-blown API

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,360
site documenting all of the

00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:37,270
distributions and all the modules in

00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,880
them and it's in bootstrap so it looks

00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:43,420
nicer than drupal.org xapi I in Garland

00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,460
and then there's a github pages for

00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:48,580
these various things but get some later

00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:51,490
on so drupalcon Sprint's I'm going to be

00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,500
around all thursday and friday so please

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,120
tweet me come up afterwards if you want

00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,610
to talk more if you want hands on demos

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,290
if you want to help getting vagrant set

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,700
up you just have a question like what

00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:03,340
are you thinking this is ridiculous

00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,690
anything like that please let me know be

00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,940
working to build out additional

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,890
flexibility in the system or at least

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,630
ping ideas off people so often in higher

00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:13,420
education we're all in these like silos

00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,740
where it's one or two people doing more

00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,780
than one or two people should be tasked

00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,890
with doing so it's always good to talk

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,860
to other people and bounce these ideas

00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:24,190
around so who's currently involved it's

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,410
primarily Penn State but recently I was

00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,330
able to announce that we go were awarded

00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:31,090
a grant or university of madison was

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:33,160
awarded a grant rather to pilot Elms

00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,350
Learning Network for the law school so

00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,430
they've been using it at the group

00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,320
called the Center for patient

00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,970
partnerships that I've been working with

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,080
them to get it implemented there they've

00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,409
got five courses that

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,180
active and we're looking it's actually

00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:48,699
July one we're going to start kickoff

00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,169
meeting between our group and their

00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,270
group to say like okay what are we

00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:54,400
actually talking about here and getting

00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:59,289
getting things going there so was a a

00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,909
big deal for me where can I get elms

00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:03,669
Learning Network I had these links up

00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:07,469
before but Elms ln org it's most likely

00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:10,439
place 99.5 percent of the system is GPL

00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:12,879
based you know open source and out there

00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:14,560
the other point five percent would be

00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,509
like you know your way of connecting to

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,379
Penn State authentication systems and

00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:20,110
things like that that really aren't

00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:21,819
relevant anyway so a lot of that's

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,379
released as examples though to say like

00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:25,539
this is the way Penn State implements us

00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:27,370
tried very hard to make this a system

00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:30,219
that Penn State happens to have ingested

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,659
and be implementing instead of a system

00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:34,719
just built for Penn State because then

00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:36,520
the what's the reason you idiot I can't

00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:38,919
really share that out as easily so what

00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,590
is Elms Elms is more than just a

00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:44,379
distribution Elms is actually kind of

00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:46,750
more of an initiative it's a saying that

00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:48,909
anything produced four elms you know

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,259
elearning courses at the college of arts

00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:53,800
and architecture where it's house it

00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:58,020
hosted can be released back publicly and

00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:01,300
that's a pretty darn generic statement

00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:04,389
like six years ago now seven years ago

00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,550
when this was made so this is spiraled

00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:09,310
way out of control from one site in one

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:12,460
module at one website at one time into

00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:15,310
lots of modules themes distributions a

00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:17,830
style guide and multiple installation

00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:20,740
profiles so when I say modules I say

00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,569
between 150 and 200 modules at this

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,479
point if we're actually counting a dot

00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:26,860
module as a module lots of features that

00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:29,139
are out there these are just a couple of

00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,270
them themes we've got much less of

00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:33,849
although at underscore Mike underscore

00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:35,949
Collins is in the front row and he makes

00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,779
them very well so harass him and he'll

00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:40,719
make more for it i'll be showing

00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:43,180
something that's kind of prototyped as

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,680
well style guide we had a full style

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:48,010
guide produced that is completely open

00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:51,520
source it's is for the Elms project but

00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:52,779
it's actually for describing how it call

00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,070
it's how a college can talk about

00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:57,130
courses and programs

00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:59,230
ms and faculty members in a way that's

00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,330
very visually appealing and it's not

00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,340
specific to Helms that was very

00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,650
important in what we were doing so you

00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,090
can take these raw assets and use them

00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,710
for whatever you want quite frankly they

00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:10,900
obviously have been implemented and make

00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,820
sense in our context but I highly

00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,220
recommend it J Perry works did the work

00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,170
for us and then he actually went the

00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,110
extra mile and open sourced everything

00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:21,730
made sure that everything was legally

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:24,940
releasable we also have distributions

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,620
which I'll talk about so I show you know

00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,360
I have some screenshots here these were

00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,770
basically in case the internet is no

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,930
longer available and I wanted to go to a

00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:34,330
real thing but just for an idea of what

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,800
some of our courses look like they're

00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,090
run in a system called MOOC this is

00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,950
actually a course at the Center for

00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,830
patient partnerships they do a lot more

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:44,080
with it but I'm not allowed to show that

00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:47,050
Elms media which is for asset management

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,300
and embedding of items so here we had

00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:52,210
this big grid we've had it since 2010

00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,980
it's still Drupal 6 but it uses a lot of

00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:57,040
the same concepts use a short code

00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,560
snippet embed system I frames for you

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,020
know responsive video things like that

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,510
so what is Elms Learning Network then so

00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,070
a little bit of context for all the ed

00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,380
use out there I'm sure many of you know

00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:11,760
this already but things must be

00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:14,920
sustainable by very small teams also

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,400
personal identifiable information or p2p

00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,480
I I leads to a lot of people

00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:23,860
self-hosting especially around learning

00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:25,390
management analytic data specifically so

00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,130
that's something to keep in mind with

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,930
when working with vendors there's small

00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,640
windows for actual deployment of

00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:32,170
innovation because if you think of the

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,260
semester is broken up into four times a

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:37,960
year these are paying customers / you

00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,150
know students hundreds of them coming

00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,130
into a space expecting it to work you're

00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,870
not going to make drastic changes after

00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:46,300
that initial window you're going to

00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:48,040
breathe again because it's a small team

00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,980
of people and you just got this working

00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,480
for a lot of people coming in and we

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,480
live in the glorious land of the

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,440
do-it-all LMS so let's briefly look at

00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:02,080
the LMS of today or the 90s because it's

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,260
the exact same thing that it's been

00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:09,280
since then it is one massive point of

00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:11,860
success lots of success and failure for

00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,200
that matter um it's because it's an

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,240
overcrowded feature set it really would

00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,370
you build a website that did all if you

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,740
think of what an LMS does it's got

00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,410
discussion boards it's got email routing

00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,850
it's got rosters it's got grades it's

00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,200
got rubrics it's got ways people can

00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,700
collaborate it's usually got Chad

00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,290
engines it's got content it's got a way

00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,670
to do a syllabus and that's just the

00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,320
ones I could think of immediately it's

00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,970
got all kinds of group management and

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,580
all kinds of other stuff like that

00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,560
that's a lot for anyone system to do no

00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,960
one's going to like one product that

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,050
does that much like you don't build

00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,210
every Drupal site the same way so it's

00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:48,700
time for a preachy break unfortunately

00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,800
because this makes my eyes bleed I wake

00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,540
up every day and I just look at this

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,310
system that we have to use we've used it

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,650
since I started there I've been there

00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:59,020
for like 12 years and it's the same

00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,760
system it looks the same way many of you

00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,890
are probably familiar with this but it's

00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,950
a dinosaur we don't build things this

00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:07,750
way anymore you don't build one the

00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:10,210
human system and then expect people to

00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,010
be happy with it they usually roar like

00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,570
a dinosaur is that obviously is and this

00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,750
causes people that are instructional

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,310
technologists to drink and dinosaurs to

00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,040
start to roar because of how much you're

00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:23,080
drinking so what do faculty and students

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,880
do they want to be innovative they want

00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,850
to use tools that are outside of the one

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,460
big bucket so they go to Google or

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:32,080
anywhere else for that matter and there

00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,700
are issues with it I mean it's great to

00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,670
be innovative it's great to want to do

00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,380
new things with your course content or

00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:40,839
learning resources but there are PII

00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,339
concerns affiliated with this which is

00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:44,290
why people like me usually detract from

00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:46,750
doing that outright without contracts

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:48,580
and things user experience concerns

00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,260
associate with multiple logins you know

00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,370
you might be on a Microsoft product for

00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,630
one part of a course might be on a

00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,730
Google product for another part of the

00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:57,010
course your actual university login

00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,810
those types of things data retention

00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,060
security policies is getting a lot more

00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,260
policy centric but you know are they

00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:05,110
maintaining this data what are they

00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,550
doing with the data and support for you

00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:09,370
know just general support for unknown

00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:10,570
services if you don't if the you don't

00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,130
know that an instructor is using

00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:14,440
something and you start getting support

00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:17,230
tickets coming in it's like what are you

00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,850
talking about so it can be very

00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,160
overwhelming if that service were to go

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,329
down

00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,649
this is less of a problem because

00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:23,690
usually people are going to you like

00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:25,819
Google and things but it can still be an

00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:29,120
issue and the big one that has bold is

00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:30,620
accessibility so if you are developing a

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,730
course and you are telling people they

00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:36,620
have to go to site abcdefg to get their

00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,689
materials to take that course you have

00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,720
to ensure the accessibility of all those

00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:43,670
systems and if you notice a problem on

00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,560
one of them if it's a big vendor you're

00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:47,000
probably putting in a support ticket but

00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,149
that might not be enough to protect you

00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,029
legally so how is Elms ln different

00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:55,250
towns Ellen is a suite of tools approach

00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:56,930
to learning management system design I

00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,490
don't like calling it an LMS but if you

00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,439
want to and that makes most sense you

00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:03,139
that's fine it's getting from this

00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:05,180
concept of one big system to a lot of

00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:08,420
smaller systems that are all coupled

00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:11,209
together with web services to quote

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:14,209
someone it's not about the next system

00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:16,160
to implement it's a mindset that you

00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:19,209
will be deploying systems so long as you

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:24,199
exist as an institution and I was by me

00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:26,000
just now partly in a cool voice so we're

00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:27,769
going to do this via Drupal so we've got

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,060
the Elms Learning Network suite of tools

00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:32,480
if you will which are all these cool

00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:35,060
logos and so the scope of these systems

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,680
we tie down so that each of them and

00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,449
these relate to distributions in Drupal

00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,579
but that each of them their scope

00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:42,620
doesn't overlap in any way so we've got

00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,870
CIS which is your logistics and more of

00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,910
your marketing how do we talk about

00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:49,069
ourself as a college or course catalog

00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,180
our programs things like that as well as

00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:52,189
keep the lights on how do we get

00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,040
students routed through to take these

00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:57,079
courses um MOOC I just took the

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,180
namespace I don't like MOOCs I don't

00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:01,670
like that name but a lot of people know

00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,990
what the namespaces it's for content

00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,610
outlining and more of the flow of a

00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,199
course that you go if you're familiar

00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,730
with like lesson one lesson to lesson

00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:11,209
three and you go through the instruction

00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,410
that's where that happens CLE is Elms

00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:14,689
collaborative learning environment

00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,550
that's for student submissions rubric

00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:18,439
based feedback we're getting into some

00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:21,559
html5 audio recording soon which is

00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:22,939
really cool with that blogs everyone

00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:24,709
knows what a blog is but at least you

00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:26,660
could have a protected course blog if

00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:28,730
someone wants to more so post things in

00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,180
a river of news type of style to their

00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,640
content

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,890
elms media asset management system

00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,690
that's a mouthful but you tell what that

00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:38,270
is we actually use P WIC for our

00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,500
analytics of just kind of generic like

00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,870
hey students are going to all these

00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,060
courses I highly recommend p WIC over

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,890
google analytics because you own your

00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,080
data it's a open-source version of

00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:50,150
google analytics effectively you install

00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,130
it it runs on my sequel has its own

00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,570
community it's very cool and then

00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:57,350
there's AI core which i always trail off

00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:59,570
is a secret project so in our network

00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,460
we've got a single drupal site at the

00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:04,070
CIS which is kind of your hub that's

00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:06,500
knitting this experience together and at

00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:08,570
our asset management system it doesn't

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,570
have to be a single point but we do for

00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:13,370
ours so per course network we're talking

00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,630
about multiple Drupal sites being

00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,980
produced for each of these which all of

00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,050
a better visual a second you could

00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,480
produce any of these things in fact the

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:24,710
CIS is capable of producing any of these

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,090
things it uses a jobs file basically if

00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,650
you're familiar with Jenkins it doesn't

00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,970
use Jenkins because we didn't have time

00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,950
to develop that at the time but it's the

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,780
same type of idea you kick out a job it

00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,860
goes oh I know how to read that runs a

00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:37,010
bunch of dress commands and how the

00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,480
other side you get a Drupal site and in

00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,190
fact the way that we have this package

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,920
we also have support for non Drupal

00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:45,350
platforms so we've got P wick built into

00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,660
the entire thing so you can see we've

00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,730
got our little Network here and the way

00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,850
that this comes up visualizing it is

00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:55,100
we've got really dated system com which

00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,470
points you out to online dot sight calm

00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,180
and then all of the other tools live at

00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,520
a similar type of address so we've got

00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:04,670
you know basically the name of what this

00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:08,000
is so interact blog courses analytics

00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:10,010
media studio as a sub domain off of

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,800
whatever this grouping organization is

00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,060
whether it's a college or a department

00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,290
you know it could be a whole university

00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:18,410
I wouldn't deploy it that way but it

00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:19,970
could be so what's a course experience

00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,040
like because we're talking about taking

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,720
a student and saying you need to

00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,910
interact with all these systems but

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,320
you're obviously we have to make it so

00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,090
they never know they're interacting with

00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,940
all these systems because otherwise you

00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,410
X will suffer drastically so we have

00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:36,170
single sign-on systems things like

00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:38,260
cosine ldap we've got something called

00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:41,450
webaccess it's a single sign-on system

00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:42,510
things like LTI tin can oh ah these can

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,130
also be used to do

00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:49,350
the same thing saw someone do a jig

00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:51,060
because I said tin can JSON and XML can

00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:53,460
be used for the actual systems to talk

00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,260
to each other behind the scenes which is

00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,840
also very important in stitching the

00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:00,570
experience together so we could have one

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,970
course if you will be you know a

00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,740
combination of these tools and have

00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,350
another course the accommodation of

00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,410
these tools so we're not limiting people

00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:11,670
or saying you need to use these five

00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:13,410
different learning management tools or

00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,750
here's here's the group's functionality

00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:18,030
or whatever it is because we use lti2

00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,620
pipe people between the systems more

00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,540
easily or tin can or what have you and

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,610
then the systems can talk to each other

00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:26,160
on the back end via restful api calls

00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:29,940
every system that's made is a restful

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:32,670
api call there is a restful engine you

00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,590
could also have old-school 001 which is

00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,240
just it's a course site and you put

00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,850
everything there you're still at least

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,070
gaining from the automation because down

00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:43,380
the road I don't know what will be

00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:45,030
available five years from now but I

00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,070
still hopefully we'll be working on

00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:50,010
projects like this because this is crazy

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:52,890
big scope project so when we come up

00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:54,360
with the Drupal 8 blog tool I want to be

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,280
able to talk to the dribble a blog tool

00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,930
without having to go and upgrade every

00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,960
aspect of the codebase that I've been

00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:02,640
working on for years so if just the blog

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,700
tool needs upgraded it limits the scope

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,290
of that one system so that we use JSON

00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,810
messages back and forth between them

00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:11,490
because rest is built into Drupal 8 and

00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,690
then we don't care the Drupal 8 anymore

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:16,350
we care that we're sending them off to

00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:18,240
someplace else to do a specific task so

00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:20,850
what we're talking about is the concept

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,400
of networked Drupal distributions each

00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:25,980
course forming a small network of sites

00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,530
all playing together that way system

00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:31,500
usage is based on the goals of the

00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:33,570
course the thing it always should have

00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,290
been when you're making a course you

00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:38,910
don't ever just hand someone the same

00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:41,460
bread box and put the same bread in it

00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:43,710
every time and expect the same result so

00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,840
as another preaching warning this is a

00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:49,020
brand new idea and we mean serious

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:53,010
business with this a brand new idea no

00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:55,830
one has ever thought of except they have

00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:57,990
because everyone outside of ed tech

00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:01,740
does this all the time with the way they

00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:03,570
deploy systems maybe you've heard of

00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,750
this way I would I googled it to find

00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:08,700
this one so we have a very thin branding

00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,100
bar for the most part across the top of

00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,559
every Google application you go to it's

00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,450
on a different domain or sub domain or

00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:17,669
what have you but yet your user

00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:19,350
experience doesn't magically suffer when

00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:21,779
you go to these different tools you

00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:24,510
don't expect functionality in YouTube to

00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:26,480
be the functionality in Google Docs they

00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:29,519
have very different compartmentalized

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,860
behaviors they can share data and that's

00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,000
where the RESTful API calls are going on

00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,760
behind the scenes you just never think

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,950
about it so this allows Google to roll

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,419
out new products more easily without

00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:43,440
being weighed down by what they were

00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:45,450
doing in the past so it's more of adapt

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,789
and adopt technological structures and

00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,740
then in our case let's implement them

00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:52,080
via open source instead of outsourcing

00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:54,240
to you know Google or any of these other

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,740
ones because we can do the same exact

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,200
type of a thing this is a terrible

00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,419
screenshot on such a large screen but

00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,549
this idea of having a thin consistent

00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:04,590
branding that lets you know contextually

00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:05,820
oh I'm in this course and i'm doing

00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,679
something affiliated with this course

00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,720
but you stop caring what system you're

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,309
on because as a student you shouldn't

00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,480
care what system you're on you should

00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:13,710
just be interacting with the course

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,710
doesn't matter where the information

00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:19,080
comes from so we're talking about a

00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:21,690
college-wide learning network that's

00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,750
what we've got rolled out and doing this

00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:26,789
/ college because it's based on the CIS

00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,899
we start to get into something I tried

00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:29,909
to describe a long time ago as

00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:32,610
structured anarchy where we've got a

00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:34,860
system that a site request system a site

00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:36,870
factory what have you that is stamping

00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,490
out all of these different systems and

00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:41,179
then we go oh well we'll just give you

00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:43,710
the same type of site requestfactory

00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:45,960
this is already going on at Penn State

00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,970
people just don't seem to realize it

00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,519
there are six or seven colleges using a

00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:52,230
site factory in some form and they're

00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,840
not even using the same one I'm using

00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:56,490
the thing I'll show today because we're

00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,590
trying to get people onto that approach

00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:00,269
we've got a much older site factory that

00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:03,260
literally just does my sequel scrapes

00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:06,840
and manually create sites PHP or

00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:08,429
settings up PHP files preed rush days

00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,950
quite frankly because of how old that

00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:11,830
was

00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:13,300
so this is already going on and we're

00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,610
talking about a lot a lot a lot of

00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,800
Drupal sites so how do we go about

00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:19,750
managing all this anarchy because now

00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,670
we're talking about intentionally

00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,890
causing it at some level if people can

00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:26,560
go in and they can request new courses

00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:28,740
and a parts of a course relate to Drupal

00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:32,980
sites how do we go about managing that

00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:35,710
so we do it through abstraction have a

00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:38,500
lot of abstraction quite frankly but so

00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:39,490
modules work in any Drupal site so a lot

00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:43,240
of the modules that have been produced

00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:44,680
four albums Learning Network don't say

00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,000
anything related to Helms Learning

00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,280
Network there's a module called profiler

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,330
builder profiler builder doesn't have

00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,670
anything to do with Elms Learning

00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,050
Network on the surface but it automates

00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,230
the process of creating new

00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:57,040
distributions and install profiles

00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,260
Learning Network has a lot of

00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,580
distributions and install profiles so

00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:04,300
that's the way we can start to make life

00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:06,760
more sane or my life more sane in doing

00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,770
some of these things themes are also all

00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,120
contributed back we've got independent

00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:12,400
distributions so even though I'll show

00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,200
all of them working together any of them

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,810
can be cherry picked and used as a

00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,940
standalone is the idea and then there's

00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:22,690
the galaxy packaging format which is

00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:26,050
actually a layer built on top of DSL em

00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:27,910
it's a symlink manager which I highly

00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:29,950
recommend checking out if you're into

00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:34,930
the multi-site versus non multi-site

00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:36,280
debates but I'll show that so because

00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:38,290
we've abstracted things we can

00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,880
collaborate with other groups that are

00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:41,860
doing this there's a lot of ed tech

00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,300
vendors out there it's some in this room

00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:46,090
I'm sure it's all them down on the

00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:48,070
vendor floor but these are three things

00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:50,290
that I don't currently have coverage for

00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,060
in my system and it's intentional

00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:53,290
because I'm seeing I'm sitting on the

00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,870
sideline and seeing how things play out

00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:58,150
with these h5 p is the most exciting in

00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:00,490
my mind because it's not actually Drupal

00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:04,090
based but it's heavily integrating with

00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:06,850
Drupal it's a HTML 5 based kind of

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,740
create interactive experiences widget II

00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:12,910
thing I highly recommend checking it out

00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:15,130
a Pingo is an LMS a traditional one

00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:16,480
point LMS we still need student you know

00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:18,550
who's logged in for this course

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,680
logistical data so I'm keeping an eye on

00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,890
that as well as its Drupal we can have a

00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,350
conversation

00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:26,600
you know I in the last talk that some of

00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:29,180
us are in you said like someone said

00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,790
well why don't we just use Moodle okay

00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:34,280
but let's go out five years from now you

00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:36,020
still have to hire someone to run Moodle

00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,640
or go to a Moodle hosted service and

00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,470
that's yet another vendor you're going

00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,900
and dealing with having support issues

00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:45,230
with that can't talk to your Drupal

00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:47,510
people I work with our website

00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:49,160
development person and he has found all

00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:50,420
kinds of great stuff and I come to these

00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,790
events and I find all kinds of great

00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,470
stuff all of you out there or developing

00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,960
things four elms Learning Network you

00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:58,610
just don't know it right because you

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,090
made an improvement two views well that

00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:04,190
fixed tons of issues in my system you've

00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:06,050
developed entity cash well now all of my

00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:08,510
stuff has a lot more performance

00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:11,030
enhancements varnish vagrant all these

00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:12,500
tools that we tap into traditionally

00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:14,420
EdTech builds pretty much from scratch

00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:17,750
if you've seen what's out there or is

00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:20,390
highly proprietary so another way of

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:22,370
managing it is through fractal system

00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:24,500
design so we're managing chaos through

00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:27,020
repeatability and so everything is a

00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:29,090
restful web service as I mentioned and

00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,980
that way everything's very repeatable we

00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,930
also allow for this concept of

00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,520
structured descent because we're always

00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,650
going to have faculty or staff member

00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:40,160
that says I want the block to be down

00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:42,050
lower or I one I something I want that

00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,580
view to have an additional field in it I

00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,290
want that content type to have another

00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,700
field in it and they might not express

00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:49,310
the concept that way but that's what

00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:51,980
they're asking you for if it's one big

00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:55,790
bucket you start making all these apps

00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:57,590
and features and just tons of stuff on

00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:59,510
stuff that you can't or you're just kind

00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:03,260
of fighting against what Drupal wants to

00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:05,450
naturally do which is be a site and we

00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:07,460
use simple addresses that are readable

00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:09,410
so we've got tool dot university /

00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:12,020
course and if you go to any of that you

00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:15,440
can go to that tools implementation of

00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:17,560
course for that University and I love

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,420
this little vegetable so this is the

00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,310
it's a broccoflower type of a thing but

00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:24,290
so you see it's that the fractal is a

00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:26,030
natural pattern in nature and so the

00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:28,010
idea is looking at this at a high level

00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:29,720
if we're looking at these little pods as

00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,710
Drupal sites there's a ton of Drupal

00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,500
sites going on here and this is

00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:34,580
terrifying but if we use a repeatable

00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,230
pattern as

00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:38,600
as we can manage one drupal site

00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:40,399
effectively we can step up a level and

00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,190
manage a network of Drupal sites

00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:44,899
effectively until we stop caring how

00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:46,610
many Drupal sites there are because as

00:26:44,899 --> 00:26:48,679
long as the initial design pattern is

00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:51,260
sound then you're going to be able to

00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:55,100
manage this chaos that at a high level

00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:57,559
looks like chaos also use it's called

00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,510
galaxy is what started to call it it's a

00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:00,700
distribution for distributions so the

00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:03,559
elms Learning Network is one

00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:05,929
downloadable package that you can spin

00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:07,250
up with vagrant in one place it takes an

00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:08,929
approach similar to Drupal 8 where

00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,059
there's like the core directory and you

00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:13,190
don't touch the core directory and then

00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:15,830
there's the config directory and then

00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:17,600
using dsl m and some even more crazy

00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:20,799
symlink stuff that i'll have to show the

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,269
dsl and guys we completely abstract

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:26,059
configuration from code in spar as

00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:28,970
settings dot PHP sites dot PHP files

00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:30,889
directory all that stuff lives in the

00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:33,380
config directory and is by reference

00:27:30,889 --> 00:27:34,460
over there and we have support for more

00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:37,370
than just Drupal because it's a

00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:39,289
packaging format so we've got a

00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:42,409
structure that's basically multiple

00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:43,700
multi sites so it'll be fun to see what

00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:46,669
they think of me tomorrow at the

00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:49,610
multi-site debates oh but basically

00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:51,230
we've got a Drupal distribution living

00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:54,230
out there and each Drupal distribution

00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:56,029
has a multi-site that's not structured

00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:58,730
like a normal multi-site but go over

00:27:56,029 --> 00:28:00,169
that so this is kinda know how blurry

00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:02,480
that is up there that's even readable

00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:05,120
but this is the basic idea with

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,830
something like DSL m is that you've got

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,630
everything abstracted if you look all

00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:10,580
the way to the right all of those have

00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:12,350
little arrows in OS X that's what you

00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:15,529
get the arrows for sibling and so those

00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:17,960
are all actually sim linked all as far

00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:20,600
as you know you see like index dot PHP

00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,669
for example index dot PHP is actually

00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:25,309
symlinks back into if you step back to

00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:27,169
levels into the cores directory there's

00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:28,820
a Drupal core directory and you drop in

00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:30,710
new versions of Drupal there so you can

00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:33,919
manage multiple versions of Drupal core

00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:36,950
you can manage Drupal 7 to 8 verses 7 to

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,929
9 and start to slowly migrated your

00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:41,450
systems to it by just tweaking a symlink

00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:44,480
location it's a very different way of

00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:46,100
managing this process and there's drush

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,130
functionality so you basically run like

00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,020
drush

00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:52,140
just a lie mad new or something like

00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:54,270
that getting blank stares from them and

00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,400
it'll produce an entirely new multi site

00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:58,230
for you a side benefit of this is OP

00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,180
code cache performance so this is the

00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:02,430
before and after of when we went and I

00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:04,740
switched the way we were structuring

00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:07,140
things so we went from you know a ten to

00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,580
fifteen percent idle level this is over

00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,650
a summary there's nothing going on

00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,680
really ten to fifteen percent idle

00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:16,320
traffic memory usage down to like five

00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,880
so it was it was net I didn't actually

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,070
expect that I wasn't doing it for that

00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,840
reason but it was kind of cool we've

00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:23,040
also got a lot of automation going on so

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,330
we've got a thing that automatically

00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,280
sets up the whole system or at least

00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:28,650
tries to we've got vagrant where it'll

00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:31,320
set it up in vagrant we've got rush

00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:33,000
create site which is this the job script

00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,750
that actually goes in builds a new site

00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,200
and there's also an automated alias file

00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:41,760
that will spider sites PHP and basically

00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,620
look and say what are all the sites that

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,750
exists so you can run drush calls

00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:48,930
against them so this is what one of

00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:51,660
those files looks like the first couple

00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:53,760
lines just reading the moffatts you know

00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:57,330
sing 100 that means we're making a space

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,860
at / sing 100 vu is just a grouping

00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:01,350
thing in case we have multiple colleges

00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,630
and then it's the location of it to you

00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:06,180
know where am I putting it and what is

00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:08,760
the data path to talk to it and then

00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:10,710
there's the title of the course the

00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,360
admin account for it what distribution

00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:14,670
to build and then after that you've got

00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:17,160
a ton of rush calls so basically it just

00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:18,810
runs through the first five builds a

00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:21,090
site and then it executes Saul these

00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:23,520
druk all's against that site that's been

00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:25,620
produced to kick it out in a completely

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,050
optimized automated fashion you see this

00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:30,120
even has a pre-processed CSS and jas

00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:32,700
turned on things like that there's also

00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:35,580
one line in there that is the CIS

00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:38,040
service instance uuid you see it's a big

00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:41,280
old number that's the unique identifier

00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:42,930
in CIS so it can talk back if it needed

00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,960
to so it knows hey what was the thing

00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:47,730
that produced me in the first place I

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,370
also mentioned the concept of automated

00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:51,810
aliases so we can run on any elms

00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:54,000
learning network system that's deployed

00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:57,240
we can run a call a command line of

00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,150
drush at courses dot sing 100 and i know

00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,280
i'm in the courses system

00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:04,830
and I am running it against the course

00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:08,160
called sing 100 there's also the notion

00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:10,050
of dash all so you know if if we think

00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,550
of lots of requests coming in and I'm

00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:13,020
not the one building these sites this is

00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:15,930
to get me out of the way so I'm not

00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:17,640
building these requested sites I don't

00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:19,320
know what Drupal sites have been

00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,360
requested in what courses are running

00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:24,420
over a long enough timeline so we can

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,370
run structure jobs just say okay at cook

00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:29,040
you know all the courses that we have

00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:31,830
feature referred the context portion of

00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:34,710
MU QX or something like that so that

00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:39,140
that becomes managing so enough show me

00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:39,140
already so I even yell at myself in here

00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:48,090
who Twitter so first of all just wanted

00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:50,310
to mention this is the home of the

00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:52,890
project there at least talking about its

00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:54,510
Elms ln org and so you see there's links

00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:58,140
off to the blog is going to be moved

00:31:54,510 --> 00:32:00,960
here in the future where you get to go

00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,910
to download it the API site elevator the

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,230
style guide which I mentioned which is

00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:05,790
really cool i highly recommend checking

00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:07,680
it out because it's not related to

00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:11,030
Drupal or anything that I'm doing it

00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,030
just has the name on it quite frankly

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,420
there's a you know a license page and

00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,860
YouTube channel that fun stuff and then

00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,150
there's this doodle cast that some

00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,040
people told me they actually watch it's

00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:23,460
going to cool trying to describe this

00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:25,560
concept so I've got a vagrant instance

00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,240
up here I'm not going to go through you

00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,430
know actually building it out ahead of

00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,750
time or I actually built it out ahead of

00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:33,240
time because that would take some time

00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:39,240
so I'm going to go and we're going to

00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:41,340
SSH into its so the vagrant image is

00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,720
also available publicly so you can

00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,300
download it and play with it if you want

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:49,650
to with a lot of instructions on how to

00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:51,030
make it work so when you get this all up

00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:52,740
and going you're basically given this

00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,880
blank slate I had a lot of people say

00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,010
like what the heck do you do with that

00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,390
site so I'll show what we've done with

00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:59,850
the site because again it's a tool that

00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:02,700
Penn State has used I don't want it to

00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:05,220
be Penn State's thing that you know then

00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,810
you have to reverse engineer so it comes

00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,990
with some default content out of the box

00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:12,180
the school of singularity and so there's

00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,460
sing 100 you see it's got this you know

00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,679
the idea of a promotional

00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:18,070
age where we're talking about the course

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,659
sing 100 we've got a sample syllabus

00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:22,340
overview of Wow to take it some sample

00:33:20,659 --> 00:33:25,970
screenshots and things like that so this

00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:27,590
is you know just a drupal site a

00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,659
stand-alone marketing drupal site if you

00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:32,390
can think of it at the high level you've

00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:34,909
got the faculty member so that's me in

00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:36,500
this case so you can kind of elders

00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:37,909
entity references between these things

00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,649
so you can see the courses that i taught

00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:42,380
see a highlight reel or what have you

00:33:39,649 --> 00:33:45,080
and so in the system we're highlighting

00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:47,570
our faculty we've got our courses or

00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:51,289
programs and services we offer just to

00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:52,549
put something there so to see the way we

00:33:51,289 --> 00:33:54,350
get into one of these courses or a

00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:56,240
course page you see we follow a path

00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:59,779
even in here we got home courses sing

00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,179
100 we've got tool name dot institution

00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:04,450
using it slash the name of this course

00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:08,270
which is sing 100 if i click on

00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:10,399
offerings we kind of peel back and go

00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:13,849
for behind-the-scenes so this is you

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:16,190
know this course runs every year or

00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:18,020
every semester or what have you this is

00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:21,500
where the logistical information can get

00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:24,649
routed through from a sis LTI launch

00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:26,359
from some other tool you know a legacy

00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:27,859
lms what have you or it doesn't even

00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:30,619
have to be a legacy lms you know run

00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:32,899
them side by side what have you so you

00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:36,589
can see I've got this one offering and a

00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:37,580
section in here you can just edit that a

00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:40,450
little bit to see what that looks like

00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:43,820
so it says the services that this uses

00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:47,659
some resources uses sample syllabus

00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:49,849
welcome letter the Welcome page text

00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:51,700
things like that right so this could be

00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:54,109
information that's really good to have

00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:58,609
access to if we're trying to unify a

00:34:54,109 --> 00:35:01,849
user experience across systems and we've

00:34:58,609 --> 00:35:03,440
also got access duration which because

00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:04,910
of the way the cron jobs work it will

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,520
look at this and go hey what should be

00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:09,260
activated on May eleventh and so it's

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,359
May eleventh and this runs and we'll go

00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:14,089
oh we need to put that in these various

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,680
courses to give access on August

00:35:14,089 --> 00:35:17,869
sixteenth we can then use that

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,190
information and say like okay well we

00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:21,170
got to boot these people out or what

00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:22,850
have you so again very logistical

00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:25,910
information that's stored in here

00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:28,130
so I'm going to save this section

00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:32,240
offering because that's much less

00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:33,470
interesting and it's going to think

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,300
about it for a while because it is

00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:40,520
running locally based on the resources

00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:42,970
that is has quit Twitter in the

00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,970
background

00:35:50,109 --> 00:35:53,019
we're going to move on from that to this

00:35:51,759 --> 00:35:54,640
one while that runs in the background

00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:57,999
there for some reason Luke Lee oh there

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,650
we go okay did it so we've got a lot of

00:35:57,999 --> 00:36:02,710
services that I produced ahead of time

00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:04,269
so one of those services is a course

00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:06,489
content outline it's what would be most

00:36:04,269 --> 00:36:08,349
familiar with looking at as far as a

00:36:06,489 --> 00:36:10,630
course so we've got our marketing and

00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:13,690
logistics this is really long here we go

00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:15,579
marketing logistics one system course an

00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:18,700
actual instructional flow in another

00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:21,430
system and so you'll see we've got only

00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:25,029
a few options this information is you

00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:27,730
know actually coming from the sea is so

00:36:25,029 --> 00:36:30,160
there's the the Welcome page text that I

00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:32,920
had placed if I want the syllabus

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:35,140
there's syllabus language so this was

00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,269
actually a restful api call that pulled

00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:40,180
in this default syllabus language and

00:36:37,269 --> 00:36:42,069
then gave a link to the syllabus from a

00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:44,829
logistics standpoint this also lets you

00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:47,430
construct paths that are looking at who

00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:50,549
the student is so you see I've got

00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:53,319
singularity 100 and this ADF 1 2 3

00:36:50,549 --> 00:36:54,609
that's because that's the section that I

00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:57,069
mean so if you imagine this is the

00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:59,319
offering of this course the domain and

00:36:57,069 --> 00:37:01,089
the location don't actually change for

00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:03,369
the offering of this course so then when

00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:06,099
I do set up and I talked about it and I

00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:08,769
post links which happens a lot you'd be

00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:09,999
shocked when you post links to the

00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:12,460
course space and the course space

00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:14,319
changes to fall to spring to summer to

00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:16,180
whatever and you need to republish eyes

00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:19,150
those everywhere it's the same link

00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:21,519
every time it figures out what section

00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:23,619
that student is affiliated with so in

00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:27,730
this case i can do / syllabus / download

00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:29,650
and that is a generic download link that

00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:32,259
will always give me the syllabus of the

00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:33,910
student that's logged into that course

00:37:32,259 --> 00:37:37,150
and should be there for that point in

00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:39,099
time we don't have I don't have any

00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:41,890
other sections in here at the moment but

00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:43,960
there's this slide out admin panel here

00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:46,210
which we're going to show different user

00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,670
experience for that as well Collins is

00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:50,710
working on but you can see I have my

00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:53,200
list of sections in here and so this is

00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:54,910
the the little identifier that's kind of

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,980
hooking things together from the sea is

00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:58,599
to make sense of it in this system so

00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:02,230
that the student gets a unified user

00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:03,020
experience looking at just you know

00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:06,830
though this is

00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:08,720
moog tool just looking at it quickly you

00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:10,430
see we've got an outline of pages here

00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,340
we can click through this is the book

00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:16,940
module the site that I had produced

00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:18,320
ahead of time actually just it you can

00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,440
tell it you know what the full content

00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,150
to create and you know you should be

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,470
pretty familiar with this stuff right so

00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:26,570
this is you know we're just looking at

00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:29,660
Drupal and we've got the title for the

00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:32,960
page we've got a well optimized version

00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:35,120
of CK editor for which has a lot of nice

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,060
accessibility enhancements in it we've

00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:42,530
got code mirror that's what does this

00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:45,200
dreamweaver esque thing and we've also

00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:47,630
got some templates that we can dump in

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,220
and so we've got some well-made ones

00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:51,620
like we've got a nice-looking table here

00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:54,350
you can edit that is an accessible table

00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:57,410
out of the box we've also got topic

00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:59,500
readings so this is a well formatted CSS

00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:05,930
list of items that's also accessible and

00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:09,200
so go down save I can normally would so

00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:11,630
that we would generate a page it's also

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,160
mobile responsive this is you know oh

00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:15,830
wow these are things that are sometimes

00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,600
Wow factors for educational technology

00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:19,460
people people familiar with Ella messes

00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,140
but at a dribble conference is not going

00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:25,340
to be impressive that you can go

00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:28,370
responsive oh but so we've got a mobile

00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:31,040
mode experience for that there's also

00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:34,160
thanks to this module called accepts

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,740
actually called accessibility and the

00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,720
quail API which is an external library

00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:41,450
you can get this thing that's it right

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,030
here says check accessibility and so

00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:46,250
click check accessibility and it'll take

00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:48,470
a moment because it actually skims the

00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:50,510
page and what it's going to do is there

00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:52,580
we go it's going to look at the content

00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:54,500
in the context of what I'm working on

00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:56,990
and give me pointers about how to make

00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,910
it accessible so it's a not a

00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:00,890
heavy-handed approach to accessibility

00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:02,840
because a lot of people complain that

00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:04,640
okay well we got to go and we got to

00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,080
penalize everything right and then we'll

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,450
make the panel's accessible and the

00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,740
blocks accessible and then we don't have

00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:12,200
to worry about they don't have a WYSIWYG

00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,880
and so instead of us making a million

00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,500
you know different panels or giving them

00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,520
that level of flexibility because I've

00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,430
seen what happens

00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:21,410
we can help enforce better accessibility

00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:23,360
practices through knowledge of

00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:25,070
accessibility so you see here we've got

00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,870
I don't actually have any straight up

00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:28,790
errors it will give you like a red X

00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:31,910
type of a thing if you have something

00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:33,650
that's wrong but if i click on in this

00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:35,480
case we've got image title you know it's

00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:37,460
just says hey make sure that h2s aren't

00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,070
used for formatting so that's the actual

00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:41,870
recommendation associated with nh2

00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:44,000
you're not supposed to use an h2 for a

00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:46,670
purely stylistic purpose it has to have

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,280
meaning and convey it but on then can

00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:51,650
also be used visually looking at

00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,260
bulleted lists there's an h3 in there

00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:56,210
there's this at the bottom that's you

00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,680
know a fake blockquote so it's saying

00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:00,110
hey just make sure you're not using

00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,250
block quotes for indentation purposes

00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:03,200
you have no idea how many people

00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,330
actually just want to indent stuff and

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,830
make it block quote for that reason also

00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,780
give feedback on the table so there's a

00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:11,270
lot more feedback on the table to say

00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:12,560
you know make sure that this has summary

00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:14,210
information that actually makes sense

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,250
make sure there's a caption affiliated

00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:18,590
with it that makes sense make sure that

00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:21,110
you have I believe it's called yeah call

00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:23,000
or call group on it so it can better

00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:24,860
educate people about how to make

00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,560
accessible content which is a huge deal

00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,460
for education at any site it doesn't

00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,460
have to be in Helms Learning Network

00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:35,060
stuff um you need to have your content

00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:37,150
accessible we're required to meet quick

00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:39,920
tag to point o Double A at the moment

00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:42,860
another nice aspect of the module is it

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,690
input at you can say i'm using this so

00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:47,090
you could use section 508 if it's

00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:48,320
government you can use double a and then

00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,760
i guarantee once we get everything up to

00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,830
double-a they'll say you need to do

00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,720
triple a or you need to do whatever the

00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:57,320
new thing is so it's nice that it's not

00:41:53,720 --> 00:42:00,380
designed specifically for that as far as

00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:04,820
some other functionality in here there's

00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:06,650
the outline designer so you got book

00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:10,040
outline it's basically scaffold on top

00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:12,440
of the book module so that you can

00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:14,090
quickly assemble outlines of how this

00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,510
course should work this works in any

00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:19,130
Drupal site I often use it for

00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:20,960
scaffolding out what the actual site

00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:23,210
outline is of a site in the context of

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,750
the site you can delete things quickly

00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:29,300
duplicate them all that fun stuff

00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:30,740
so let's jump back to you see here we've

00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,570
got you know these other tools that are

00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:35,750
in here so we can have completely

00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:37,520
different experiences based on the tool

00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:39,380
that you're going to and so they can

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,760
look different be a different theme it

00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:43,760
can have different functionality and

00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:46,280
we're siloing it in its own Drupal site

00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:49,720
so each one of these that I'm going to

00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:52,730
here we go open up my vagrant instance

00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:54,350
you'll see there's a kind of again

00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:56,720
following this fractal idea there's a

00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:58,730
fractal pattern even to the naming of

00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,830
the database structure so that you can

00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:03,500
if you had to you know we're going to

00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:05,600
move this to a different hosting cluster

00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,460
or whatever with just the courses

00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,710
toolset that we could do that very

00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,750
easily from a visual or a pattern match

00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:14,450
perspective so we've got courses

00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:16,670
underscore some grouping item underscore

00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:18,800
the name of the course in this case it's

00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:21,620
media underscore grouping item the name

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,390
of the course so you see I've got you

00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:25,430
know my blog tool this is actually using

00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:28,370
medium blog which is a distribution I

00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:33,400
didn't make and was able to integrate

00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:35,630
into this approach we can go to

00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:38,810
interactive course object repository

00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:40,760
which is for all of our html5 fun stuff

00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:42,530
in the future so this is where I plan on

00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:46,040
putting in H Phi P doesn't have a nice

00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:48,140
theme obviously but you know we can tap

00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,570
into these really interactive nice

00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:53,570
slick-looking tools like the timeline

00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:55,310
module or latest timeline jas so that

00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:57,860
you can construct a timeline and we do

00:43:55,310 --> 00:44:00,110
that in a different site instead of in

00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:02,570
line with the course because if we want

00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:05,030
to update the course content system as a

00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:07,190
whole to Drupal 8 we can still just

00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:09,680
embed iframes to this very interactive

00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:11,600
content that might have fairly exotic

00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,480
modules that aren't going to be updated

00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:18,200
nearly as rapidly or in the worst case

00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:21,260
aren't going to be updated until you pay

00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,390
for them so looking seeing what that

00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:26,480
looks like in our course content then if

00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:27,890
we go back to the content outline we've

00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,930
got the introduction page actually

00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:32,090
embedded that in there and so this is

00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:33,860
served up from that other thing you saw

00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:36,020
there was a just a simple iframe embed

00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:37,430
code we put that in there and we now we

00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:39,880
can leverage the interactive

00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:42,220
capabilities of that system in

00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,289
the context of this and the wonderful

00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:46,299
thing about iframes is that they're

00:44:44,289 --> 00:44:48,339
pretty naturally responsive and so if

00:44:46,299 --> 00:44:51,160
the content inside of it is responsive

00:44:48,339 --> 00:44:53,380
it will just appear that it's there it

00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:55,539
uses a theme called NCI frame theme

00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:58,990
which uses a module called entity iframe

00:44:55,539 --> 00:45:00,670
that i wrote to do this and so it also

00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:03,039
allows for cross cross domain

00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:07,269
communication if you need that to get

00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:08,950
data in and out of it so you can that's

00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:10,750
the basic idea we're embedding lots I

00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:12,339
frames it and this isn't anything new

00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:15,190
either because that's what YouTube does

00:45:12,339 --> 00:45:16,869
right people go home I iframes they're

00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:20,440
terrible terrible design you use them

00:45:16,869 --> 00:45:22,119
every day with YouTube every time you

00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,789
embed YouTube somewhere it's an iframe

00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:27,279
instead of object code because when they

00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:29,500
want to change your API they do it just

00:45:27,279 --> 00:45:30,880
inside that little window and you've got

00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:33,549
the update on your site and you don't

00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,730
even think about it usually so let's go

00:45:33,549 --> 00:45:40,269
about actually requesting a site in the

00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:43,269
background here so building out a new

00:45:40,269 --> 00:45:46,150
site is I go to get in this case there's

00:45:43,269 --> 00:45:49,420
set up course up here and I'm going to

00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:51,160
build a new one a new one go to a title

00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:53,500
of a new one because I'm really original

00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:56,410
at this point we're going to require a

00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:58,509
login to it we can select the default

00:45:56,410 --> 00:46:00,400
content for it so in this case I'll just

00:45:58,509 --> 00:46:02,410
go with very minimalist content but it

00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:06,720
can it's basically doing a feeds import

00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:11,380
of data and we'll create that outline

00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:13,690
say that it's for summer now bunch of

00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:16,660
random characters because it's a demo

00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:18,819
can upload the syllabus and welcome

00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:22,410
letter right there and we'll hit create

00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:25,869
course so this will run a batch API a

00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:27,819
batch API call which there we go it's

00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:30,309
going to sit there and it's waiting till

00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:33,430
it notices that it's picked it up so we

00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:35,440
go into the vagrant area and look at you

00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:37,119
know this is the structure of Elms

00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,920
Learning Network so this is the galaxy

00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:42,160
packaging format it doesn't look

00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:44,980
anything like drupal does it but if I go

00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,119
into something like domains you'll see

00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:48,490
these are the different you know

00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:50,109
subdomains going out to the left if i go

00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:52,299
into online it will start to look like

00:46:50,109 --> 00:46:53,860
drupal but with a lot of symlinks

00:46:52,299 --> 00:46:55,570
involved so it is

00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:57,640
Packaging even wear those siblings

00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:59,740
should live so that it's doing it in a

00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:02,770
very logical manner a fractal based

00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:04,420
matter config as i mentioned that's

00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:06,610
where all this things are sim linking to

00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:09,070
but looking config it has a structure

00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:11,050
that mirrors what's going on with the

00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:13,120
rest of the structure of the system so

00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:15,520
that way everything is pointing to very

00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:18,520
logical places but it's outside of where

00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:21,520
you are actually deploying their the

00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:23,080
directory that has Drupal course code so

00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,600
when I say configuration is separate

00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:28,690
from code I mean like settings dot PHP s

00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:31,930
all live inside the config directory at

00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:35,670
some level in here as well there's the

00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:38,350
jobs file or folder so if I go two jabs

00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:39,880
you'll see that this a new one right

00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:41,620
here is currently processing and if I

00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,850
pull this up you'll see hey it takes

00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:45,580
about three minutes to build a site on

00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:47,200
average so it's not it's stepping

00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:50,470
through and then saying like okay it's

00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:53,170
about three minutes if we look at that

00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:54,280
we've got this a new course that course

00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:56,500
is that processing to see what that

00:47:54,280 --> 00:48:00,370
looks like so by filling out that form

00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:02,920
we created this template basically and

00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:05,500
the drudge create site script which is

00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:07,630
built into Elms Learning Network knows

00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,460
how to read this and turn it into a site

00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:12,250
in the right location so you see we've

00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:18,340
got all these dress calls all these

00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:20,620
dress calls oops that broken and so

00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:23,260
there's also we've got feeds you know

00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:24,670
the feeds import call here and so I said

00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:26,770
this will actually import content

00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:28,750
automatically from this location so we

00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:31,120
have a default working outline that

00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:32,920
could be legacy course data if you've

00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:36,010
you know done it in a previous system

00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:38,500
and you're able to get it into XML it's

00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:42,640
not a SCORM thing it then runs a cron

00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:44,410
and clear see caches so it it's got a

00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:47,800
progress file that's running well that

00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:49,480
goes there to quickly show some of these

00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,920
are some of our actual courses that

00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,540
we've you know been able to produce with

00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,150
this system so you see we've got courses

00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:58,240
dot the name of our institution body

00:48:55,150 --> 00:49:00,790
which is arts and architecture / music

00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:03,160
11 in this case and so here's an image

00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:04,780
that we've pulled in and luckily enough

00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,390
that it's actually used in our course

00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:09,760
this little vegetable thing

00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:12,250
I just realized that actually coming

00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,900
here but it's not actually there so if

00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:16,059
you're used to the media module or you

00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:17,380
used to any in line drop an image there

00:49:16,059 --> 00:49:19,779
that's not what's happening to get that

00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:21,910
there this is actually talking to The

00:49:19,779 --> 00:49:23,740
Elms media server and taking this

00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:25,420
shortcode and going oh I know that

00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:27,970
shortcode you want me to talk to that

00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:30,400
system and ask it for in this case it

00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:32,410
says the image that's being pulled up at

00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,869
this location and then it's going to

00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:36,160
throw it down there same with down the

00:49:34,869 --> 00:49:37,569
page there's actually one because we

00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,420
used to do this with JW players so this

00:49:37,569 --> 00:49:42,490
is a legacy snippet for for grabbing and

00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,510
rendering out as video so you see as I

00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:45,640
scroll down the page you've got that

00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:47,710
image we actually even pull across

00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:49,510
things to auto lightbox pull in

00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:52,180
copyright information that is stored in

00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:54,039
elie media we've got a video that's

00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:57,369
being served up from e li media here

00:49:54,039 --> 00:49:59,380
again because it's an iframe it's

00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:01,359
inherently responsive we make the

00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:02,980
content inside of it be responsive and

00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:05,140
then it becomes responsive in the parent

00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:06,220
item so as students are going through

00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,660
they don't even know that they're

00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:10,569
interacting with all these other systems

00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:13,720
that's the goal is that the student user

00:50:10,569 --> 00:50:15,519
experience doesn't suffer we can also do

00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:18,009
we do some nice things others a

00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:20,529
footnotes module so this actually goes

00:50:18,009 --> 00:50:22,299
and grabs the footnotes from li media

00:50:20,529 --> 00:50:23,319
and imprints them out in the order in

00:50:22,299 --> 00:50:25,509
which these things are placed on the

00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:28,029
page so if you have the citation data

00:50:25,509 --> 00:50:29,740
it'll nicely format it and put it in the

00:50:28,029 --> 00:50:31,299
correct order and then you have you know

00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:35,049
footnotes to jump back and forth between

00:50:31,299 --> 00:50:36,460
things i mentioned to yell I media this

00:50:35,049 --> 00:50:39,460
is y la media we're running out of time

00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:41,529
here so this just has all of our images

00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:45,009
in media we are in arts college so we've

00:50:41,529 --> 00:50:47,200
got almost two thousand videos and

00:50:45,009 --> 00:50:49,630
sixteen hundred images this point for

00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,009
like 30 40 courses and some of those

00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:53,829
videos will be you know two minutes long

00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:56,670
someone will be like an hour so we've

00:50:53,829 --> 00:50:59,500
got a lot of media and using our courses

00:50:56,670 --> 00:51:02,849
see if that oh it said access denied

00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:06,970
that's because it's running on bakery

00:51:02,849 --> 00:51:10,150
the the vagrant instance uses bakery as

00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:12,220
a single sign-on thing in Drupal drupal

00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:15,039
org uses it with groups dribble org and

00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:18,279
sometimes it doesn't always notice that

00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:21,140
you were actually in a course when it's

00:51:18,279 --> 00:51:24,120
created it but that only happens locally

00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:26,100
so if i refresh this now yeah because

00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:30,690
that my session expired from when I was

00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:33,690
working on before and this is where

00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:37,620
we're going with the UX of the course

00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:42,090
outline so very well-produced fonts it's

00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:45,180
using ZURB foundation and we've got very

00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:47,970
nicely styled content and use of

00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:54,000
typography columns nice little widget e

00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:55,770
things from ZURB this is p wick it's a

00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,970
system onto itself but it does the

00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:57,960
analytics so this is sitting there

00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:59,280
watching where people are going

00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:02,250
different pages and give us different

00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,160
reports this is collaborative learning

00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:06,450
environment so you see we've got

00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,800
students ability to submit kitten images

00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:10,020
obviously a lot of kittens and our

00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:12,180
courses for this and people to be able

00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:14,340
to go and comment on them it uses the

00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:16,800
achievements module if you've ever heard

00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:18,300
of the achievements module so that when

00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,370
I do this and hit save I think I'll

00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,110
unlock an achievement yep so we got xbox

00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:24,390
live style achievements to try and gamma

00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:26,130
phi our course content and course

00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:28,680
experiences we've got the ability to

00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:30,330
produce rubrics you see them going very

00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:32,220
fast through way too many systems at

00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:35,160
this point well it's points so that

00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:37,410
should be like 10 I'm 23 so we've got

00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:40,410
ways of auto populating rubrics which

00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:47,550
are also accessible and responsive by

00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:49,170
default and then my favorite little gem

00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:50,880
in all this and these are the things you

00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:52,260
know I'm trying to intentionally be

00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,360
overwhelming at this point and I'm

00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:56,040
running out of time um this is the stuff

00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:58,860
that's possible when you use a platform

00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:01,890
that's not specific to education because

00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:03,570
this right here is an html5 recording

00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:06,030
widget that is recording everything I'm

00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:08,520
saying saving it directly to wave

00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:10,770
sending it to the server and then when

00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:12,510
we're done it's going to be an mp3 so I

00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:14,850
could actually talk to a student after

00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:16,590
i'm reviewing their work if it's an

00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:18,030
image you know an image of their work

00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:19,800
right so they submitted an image this

00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:22,500
isn't just this snarky looking picture

00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:25,140
that I could actually using html5 canvas

00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:27,120
properties do mock-ups and say in my

00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:29,910
feedback hey you need to really focus on

00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:31,170
the areas where I use the red pen the

00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:33,180
black pen you're doing things the right

00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:37,290
way

00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:39,119
and I can hit save and as a saved

00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:42,079
feedback thing again we're not you know

00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:44,819
the UX for this isn't finished we have

00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:47,520
ml5 recording widget this is recording

00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:49,859
everything I'm saying yeah so that we've

00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:52,230
got we can start to build different user

00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:53,819
tools like this much more easily because

00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:55,530
people are out there developing them for

00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:58,140
huge projects and they never know that

00:53:55,530 --> 00:54:00,569
they're benefiting us so in the

00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:01,980
background this got produced you'll see

00:54:00,569 --> 00:54:04,800
it only has one system in its lil

00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:08,550
network so I am way beyond out of time

00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,869
here I think this is online de nada OA

00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:13,859
tu if you want to go check it out that's

00:54:09,869 --> 00:54:15,869
our CIS instance of this technology and

00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:17,430
we also do some other fun stuff with it

00:54:15,869 --> 00:54:19,050
like Google chart tools and views

00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:21,150
because again Google made this cool

00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:23,069
thing so one may views now we can make

00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:24,210
better decisions based on our

00:54:23,069 --> 00:54:27,329
enrollments and things throughout time

00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:29,910
so thank you very much and if you have

00:54:27,329 --> 00:54:43,980
questions there's a microphone over

00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:45,839
there Brian this one yeah first of all

00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:50,849
just thanks man this is this is an

00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:55,579
incredible work where do yall host y'all

00:54:50,849 --> 00:54:57,750
host you know at penn state yes and if

00:54:55,579 --> 00:54:59,579
you know the box that this is running on

00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:01,410
goes down does every single course

00:54:59,579 --> 00:55:03,569
instant yeah that's that's not a

00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:05,069
limitation of Elms Learning Network so

00:55:03,569 --> 00:55:07,410
much is it's a limitation of us having

00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:11,730
it on one server if you have unlimited

00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:13,410
resources and you know how how how could

00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:14,549
you be a couple I mean how could you

00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:16,200
spread it out it seemed I was just

00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:19,890
trying to like wrap my brain around it

00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:21,480
and it's like like you can't really use

00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:23,579
a lot of Drupal specific hosting because

00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,530
of the galaxy format and because of

00:55:23,579 --> 00:55:29,760
things like that so what how would you

00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:33,000
go about distributing the load so I

00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:35,490
think that the automation script because

00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,530
right now it's pretty naive it's a it's

00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:39,359
a bash script basically that picks up

00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:41,790
the job and does something with it

00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:43,859
because it's doing Drudge commands if

00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:46,619
that actual automation script was

00:55:43,859 --> 00:55:48,599
changed into Jenkins or whatever

00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:50,339
to say hey you have some additional

00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:52,380
logic to go oh I want to produce this

00:55:50,339 --> 00:55:55,499
distribution that should go to this

00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:57,450
server over here on the databases are

00:55:55,499 --> 00:56:00,299
all you know each one of these course

00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:02,220
sites is a different database and yeah

00:56:00,299 --> 00:56:05,430
the galaxy packaging format is mostly to

00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:07,049
do this all in one big space you'd have

00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:09,269
to start to get creative probably with

00:56:07,049 --> 00:56:12,809
like our syncing between systems what

00:56:09,269 --> 00:56:14,430
that code base is this is also a there

00:56:12,809 --> 00:56:17,579
is no point release yet because I'm

00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:19,499
waiting until the work with Madison in

00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:21,630
July to start to get to actual point

00:56:19,499 --> 00:56:25,499
releases to go like okay well this

00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:27,420
server is running you know this site

00:56:25,499 --> 00:56:29,369
factory type of stuff you're right I

00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:30,930
don't know I honestly don't know if you

00:56:29,369 --> 00:56:33,779
could put it on something like Pantheon

00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:38,609
or hawk whea cloud you would need a more

00:56:33,779 --> 00:56:40,380
generalized hosting approach like bleh I

00:56:38,609 --> 00:56:42,329
don't know enough about black mesh but

00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:44,490
if they allow more generalized server

00:56:42,329 --> 00:56:45,900
access than then yeah I think that

00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:47,190
they're definitely need to be working

00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:49,170
the automation script to make it more

00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:52,799
flexible to say like take this and put

00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:54,390
it over there at least the database

00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:56,220
flexibility built in is what I was

00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:57,869
initially going for so that we weren't

00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:59,970
painted into a corner with just one site

00:56:57,869 --> 00:57:01,230
and then the name spacing of things was

00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:04,109
also so that things can be moved around

00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:06,239
more easily so I'm looking for big

00:57:04,109 --> 00:57:09,499
thinkers like what you just said to help

00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:09,499
do that stuff

00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,650
question I might have missed it sorry

00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:23,200
what what what was the name of that

00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:26,260
drying widget that you use the library

00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:32,530
of the drawing widget yeah library did

00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:36,610
you use for that let me yeah let me see

00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:41,140
if I can pull that up I was ending Glen

00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:44,890
it's in that's part of the studio which

00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:46,630
is still not fully standard or

00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:50,410
stabilized because we're going to rock

00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:55,120
lodge that in the fall so submission

00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:58,570
assessment content types mission

00:57:55,120 --> 00:58:02,740
assessment fields what do I have is red

00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:06,850
pen canvas widget I believe is the name

00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:09,070
of it that does that the audio recording

00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:11,140
is called media media recorder but it

00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:13,600
doesn't actually know it does require

00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:16,710
the media module for that one the thing

00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,710
I've tried to avoid like the plague

00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:24,760
really amazing inch field just one of

00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:27,130
the problems were really running into is

00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:30,970
that we have all these content courses

00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:33,700
in different systems like blackboard and

00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:35,920
Moodle has there been any work or any

00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:37,960
talk about the possibility of creating

00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,940
some sort of import or export of courses

00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:43,180
from those existing systems into

00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:45,340
something like this so that always comes

00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:48,880
up and then becomes okay well we'll just

00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:51,340
use score and SCORM is not just oh yeah

00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,380
we'll just use like it's it's a lot more

00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:56,920
to it than that from anyone that has any

00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:59,020
experience doing it so we've got the

00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:01,210
ability to import an XML package which

00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:04,030
is just it's creating the nodes off of

00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:06,910
you know XML with you you IDs so if it

00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:09,610
could export is that then yes that's

00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:11,890
again big picture long term type stuff I

00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:13,600
would love to talk more about right now

00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:15,250
we're actually if you noticed like I

00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:17,050
talked about in really derogatory ways

00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:19,720
but we get a lot of our data from the

00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:23,350
LMS like I see us more as that's the

00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:25,030
host and worthy the new entity so that

00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:26,500
data is coming to us and then we never

00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:29,050
send the user experience back to it

00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:30,550
basically so we use that for the

00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:31,569
students getting access to it so we've

00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:33,180
kind of slow

00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:35,589
be changed the way we make courses

00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:37,839
through this type of cobbling together

00:59:35,589 --> 00:59:39,339
approach to say like okay well we've got

00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:41,199
videos and they're in blackboard we

00:59:39,339 --> 00:59:44,559
don't like them let's have a video

00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:46,869
server and then we do this called LTI LT

00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:49,029
is used for getting it's an OAuth push

00:59:46,869 --> 00:59:51,880
and get people to different resources

00:59:49,029 --> 00:59:53,829
that these kind of dribs and drabs we're

00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,880
slowly rolling out other tools at

00:59:53,829 --> 00:59:56,559
different domains we're slowly

00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,529
integrating them into other systems

00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:01,749
we've got like 15 courses over into this

00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:05,049
approach versus the other 20 we have

01:00:01,749 --> 01:00:07,569
still in Drupal 6 so Drupal the Drupal

01:00:05,049 --> 01:00:09,819
we have unfortunately but yes ya doing

01:00:07,569 --> 01:00:11,920
luck that's why this is more of trying

01:00:09,819 --> 01:00:13,180
to be a mind shift of like you're going

01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,650
to end up doing this again because I

01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:17,799
already talked to three people here that

01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:20,019
said like we migrated from blackboard to

01:00:17,799 --> 01:00:22,150
fill in the blank and now people are

01:00:20,019 --> 01:00:24,489
unhappy and I think they're unhappy with

01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:26,469
the just the approach it's that it's the

01:00:24,489 --> 01:00:28,569
design methodology that's all one big

01:00:26,469 --> 01:00:31,930
you know package you have to buy into

01:00:28,569 --> 01:00:34,630
and if Drupal did that that's why Drupal

01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:36,699
is so modular that's why other systems

01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:39,130
that you get it and it's everything in a

01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:41,219
box well then when it everything in a

01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:44,109
box doesn't cut it you get mad at it

01:00:41,219 --> 01:00:45,130
versus going in and googling what the

01:00:44,109 --> 01:00:50,829
you know next thing you want to

01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:53,049
integrate is what is the name of the

01:00:50,829 --> 01:00:56,670
accessibility module it's called

01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:59,289
accessibility it yeah it utilizes um

01:00:56,670 --> 01:01:00,969
yeah it's called accessibility it used

01:00:59,289 --> 01:01:04,049
to be called content accessibility but

01:01:00,969 --> 01:01:07,749
it also does theme the theme layer and

01:01:04,049 --> 01:01:10,989
it uses something called quail API which

01:01:07,749 --> 01:01:13,329
is a was PHP based but now it's jQuery

01:01:10,989 --> 01:01:15,759
based library so you can use it in

01:01:13,329 --> 01:01:18,039
anything it's just that the developer is

01:01:15,759 --> 01:01:19,839
named TV yeah yeah it's very techie be

01:01:18,039 --> 01:01:21,249
integrated with Drupal because that was

01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:25,019
her original use case but it is a

01:01:21,249 --> 01:01:25,019
standalone has its own github thing

01:01:26,459 --> 01:01:31,359
speaking of modules that you avoid like

01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:34,150
the plague like media which not to knock

01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:36,249
that it's it's has its place but one

01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:38,890
that I really avoid is organic groups

01:01:36,249 --> 01:01:41,259
and and how has that been integrating

01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:43,809
with because I noticed when I downloaded

01:01:41,259 --> 01:01:45,440
it that it's being used on your site and

01:01:43,809 --> 01:01:48,440
is it seems like it causes a lot of

01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:49,760
problems when with with other modules or

01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:53,510
other integrations have you noticed that

01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:59,230
so we use organic groups basically just

01:01:53,510 --> 01:02:01,369
to stitch together users in a tool to

01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:03,859
the fact that they are associated with

01:02:01,369 --> 01:02:06,650
that section so the section is created

01:02:03,859 --> 01:02:08,119
the little analytic or whatever that

01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:12,109
word I keep misusing as we talked last

01:02:08,119 --> 01:02:13,819
night um that piece that's in the CIS is

01:02:12,109 --> 01:02:16,609
a field collection and it's actually

01:02:13,819 --> 01:02:18,859
related to an organic group in each of

01:02:16,609 --> 01:02:20,810
the sites that's produced so all we use

01:02:18,859 --> 01:02:22,760
the organic group for though is an easy

01:02:20,810 --> 01:02:25,250
way of saying like these users are

01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:26,990
connected to this in some way so we

01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:30,380
don't really do a lot with it other than

01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:31,579
that feel good yeah there are other

01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:35,300
people they're very anti field

01:02:31,579 --> 01:02:37,849
collections what I love about it is it

01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:39,349
powered the CIS stuff with getting you

01:02:37,849 --> 01:02:41,119
know drilling down in the the data model

01:02:39,349 --> 01:02:43,069
but that rubric tool i showed that's

01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:46,150
actually fuel collections as well just

01:02:43,069 --> 01:02:48,500
rendered in a completely different way

01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:52,460
well yeah yeah that's if you can get it

01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:55,490
working it does take some time so i'm i

01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:58,400
am officially over time but if you want

01:02:55,490 --> 01:03:00,290
drupalcamp PA swag come over here please

01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:03,790
well it's not swag it's just notes but

01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:03,790
thank you all for thank you

01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:07,430
