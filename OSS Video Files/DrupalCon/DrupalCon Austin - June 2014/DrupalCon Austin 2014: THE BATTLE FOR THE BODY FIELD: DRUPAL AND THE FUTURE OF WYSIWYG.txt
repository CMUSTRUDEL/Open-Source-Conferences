Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: THE BATTLE FOR THE BODY FIELD: DRUPAL AND THE FUTURE OF WYSIWYG
Publication date: 2014-06-04
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: eaton
There's a deep conflict in the heart of Drupal 8, and its name is WYSIWYG.

For years, our community has used powerful tools like CCK and FieldAPI to manage structured content and implement powerful, flexible content models. By chunking up our content and using templates to present it, we've avoided the worst sins of "HTML blobs."

Unfortunately, Team Chunk has a deadly weakness. When narrative text is mixed with embedded media, complex call-outs, and other rich supporting material, our fields and templates have trouble keeping up. On many projects, the ever-present Body field becomes a WYSIWYG-powered no-man's-land, and all of our future-friendly content dreams are shattered.

With the addition of a powerful WYSIWYG editor to Drupal 8, the problem is even more pressing. How can we ensure that the next generation of Drupal sites is easy to manage, and flexible enough for a multi-device world? In this session, I'll explain:

The underlying content management challenges that make this problem so thorny
What we can learn from the XML community (without going crazy)
Existing Drupal tools and techniques that can bridge the gap
Which approaches sound great but sabotage complex content
Why Drupal 8's new WYSIWYG editor can help or hurt sites
The tools Drupal Core could provide to help content editors work smart
What barriers for those solutions still exist in core
How emerging web standards can simplify the implementation work

yeah this is what trivia nights gonna be

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:14,420
like to just we'll put a question up on

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:16,529
sunscreen I'll shish anyone flying

00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,439
actually that is a that is an excellent

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:22,109
point trivia night tomorrow night should

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,789
be a lot of fun also the lullaby party

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,869
at handle bar tonight at seven and

00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:30,179
Sprint's on Saturday there's still a

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:34,550
whole lot of drupal a whole lot of

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:41,700
drupalcon left to go so much Drupal's

00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:42,960
okay hi thank you there's a there's a

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,039
seat up front for anyone who wants to

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,960
actually be within throwing range of me

00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:51,600
so the battle for the body field this is

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:59,100
in no way an incendiary title or

00:00:51,600 --> 00:01:01,410
anything anyone who has participated in

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,650
the drupal universe for more than a

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,240
short period of time is probably

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,630
familiar with arguments about WYSIWYG

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,549
editing does anybody ever run into an

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,530
argument about whether to use one

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,509
whether we should have one standard

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,490
built into Drupal whether you should

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,500
turn them off and just teach people to

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,049
use mark up so they don't so they aren't

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,670
lazy we should just make them magically

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,150
better we should figure out how to embed

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:30,570
Dreamweaver in a text area anything in

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,369
between those spectrums I mean I don't

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,680
think it's I don't think it's over

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,409
extending to say that this has been a

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,630
contentious topic in our community and

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,579
it's actually come to the forefront in

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,130
the past couple of years because we

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:47,310
actually are going to ship with a really

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,200
high quality WYSIWYG editor in Drupal 8

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,549
this is fantastic so it won't even be

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,899
something that you have to go and dig up

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,119
because your client told you absolutely

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,310
you have to or you know someone in your

00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,719
company said by god we can't figure out

00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,890
how to make bulleted lists or something

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:03,000
like that it's just going to ship with

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:05,790
Drupal 8 so it's cool on some levels but

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,649
it's also reignited a lot of heated

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,209
debates about what the right way to use

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:10,860
a WYSIWYG editor is whether people

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,080
should have them at all whether they're

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,380
an abomination that should be cleansed

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,380
from the

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:22,290
earth whatever thus Rock'em Sock'em

00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:26,430
robots I I think one of the problems is

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:28,560
that we've been having entirely entirely

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,990
mistaken arguments about this we've been

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,240
fighting about the wrong things for

00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,850
quite a few years we've talked about it

00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,160
as a conflict between like ugly crappy

00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:40,590
markup that we think WYSIWYG editors

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,680
generate versus clean markup talking

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:46,290
about like you know this looking at it

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,660
as a tug-of-war between lazy content

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,060
editors who don't want to learn HTML and

00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,710
markup literacy and understanding the

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,930
tools of the web you know maybe that's

00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,730
the real conflict we're looking at maybe

00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,480
the answer is marked down the answer is

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:02,820
not marked out it is not we will get to

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,960
that later I love markdown I edit by do

00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,370
all kinds of stuff with it but the

00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,540
answer to this particular problem going

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,210
to be talking about it's not marked out

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,670
and maybe the answer is easy versus hard

00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,230
we just have to get accept that certain

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,630
kinds of things that you know people

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,490
need to do in in working on the web and

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,840
in creating content will just have to be

00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:22,230
hard and they're going to have to learn

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,030
that it's not a simple versus easy a few

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,830
things versus a lot of things that's a

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,460
lot of these subjects that we argue

00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:32,130
about are missing the point I love that

00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,380
effect so for anybody who is interested

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,210
in just leaving after five minutes and

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,140
going and getting a beer this is

00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:42,150
basically the rundown there are four

00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:45,300
really important things that we often

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:48,570
miss when we fixate on WYSIWYG editors

00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,430
as the heart of this problem one is

00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:54,209
anybody familiar with the idea of blobs

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,190
of content versus chunks of content okay

00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:57,690
the chunks versus blobs thing goes

00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,070
around in the content strategy community

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,630
a lot it was calling by Karen McGrane

00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,090
and your book content strategy for

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,830
mobile but it's the idea of we break

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,690
things up into lots of individual field

00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,430
so they can be remixed and repurposed

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,110
and you know shifted around in different

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,510
layouts and stuff like that and that's

00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,450
cool but the problem is is just treating

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,340
it as a battle between big blobs of HTML

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,890
and wonderful tiny little chunks that we

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,479
can reshuffle is insufficient to solve a

00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,520
lot of the complex content problems that

00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:25,520
we have it's an improvement but it

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,250
doesn't go all the way

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,699
the other issue is that HTML in and of

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:33,770
itself is insufficient to represent most

00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:35,990
of the content that people are creating

00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,900
on the web it's efficient to represent

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,849
how it looks in a browser but not the

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,800
meaning of the content itself there's a

00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:45,050
vocabulary mismatch between the two

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,129
we'll get to they get to what exactly

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,419
that means later the third point is that

00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:53,120
there are communities that have been

00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:55,340
tackling these weird tangley problems of

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,500
what to do with semi structured stuff

00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,240
things that are you know they have long

00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,130
narrative flows and they need to be

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,810
editorially controlled and written by

00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,599
human being but they also have little

00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:07,030
pockets and structure that need meaning

00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:09,979
and need to be at particular places

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,930
that's the kind of problem that the xml

00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:16,840
community and people in communities like

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:20,690
the data anybody here use data I'm sorry

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:23,659
Iraq no I mean they've been tackling and

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:25,099
chewing on the hard problems about semi

00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:26,539
structured content for a long time

00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:29,750
there's tons of lessons we can learn

00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:31,580
from them and then the real concrete

00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,909
take away in the Drupal community that

00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:38,120
we can really really learn is that we

00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:41,509
need to need to stick to storing meaning

00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:45,440
rather than complex markup structures

00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:46,909
and then transform them on display into

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,830
the kind of structures that we want for

00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:49,940
representational purposes and again

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,590
we're going to go into the details of

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,240
what exactly that means how it plays out

00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:57,380
and great tools that can make that

00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:59,330
easier but that's the gist of it if you

00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,860
have any significant disagreements with

00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,449
any of these things you can't in fact

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,349
throw things at me mostly if you're in

00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:08,750
the front because I don't want you to

00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:11,479
hit anybody but go for it this is a core

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:15,640
conversation so it's hopefully a little

00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:21,440
more raucous wow everybody is so quiet

00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:28,520
oh I see got it lit that's Larry we know

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:31,400
how this is going to go so the really

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,830
really hard problem that we are familiar

00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,360
with that I think our community and a

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,940
lot of other web publishing communities

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,910
have learned as the hard problem figured

00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:43,510
out solutions to is that for many many

00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:47,210
years this is how we made web pages a

00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:49,910
web page was a file on disk and a URL

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:52,460
that was accessed by a web browser and a

00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:55,690
piece of content and it was handcrafted

00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:59,870
by artisanal web monkeys in a copy of

00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:02,630
bbedit or ultraedit whatever you used

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,940
and you you sweat bullets and you know I

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,340
think Morton I think you know comes from

00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,440
the school of you you create pure

00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,270
wonderful markup and then you separate

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,390
the presentation from it with CSS it's

00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:16,580
great and this is actually an incredibly

00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:20,990
flexible incredibly powerful way to

00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:23,420
create a piece of HTML content the

00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:27,620
problem is in the real world what

00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:29,030
usually ends up happening is a WYSIWYG

00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,490
editor gets thrown on top of that

00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:33,680
because not everyone is like an HTML

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,590
artisan who wants to craft some sort of

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,780
wonderful you know piece of HTML art and

00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:44,630
this is what people end up editing

00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:46,910
documents in and that is actually Comic

00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,590
Sans and it is blinking and that is I am

00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:56,810
told although I am red green colorblind

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:58,880
I'm told that is magenta that is what we

00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,650
often encounter and anybody who's done a

00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,200
large-scale migration on an existing

00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:05,270
site either where they had lots of

00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,090
handcrafted HTML files they had to

00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:10,310
migrate into a CMS or we're just a

00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:14,660
WYSIWYG editor has been turned on and

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:17,120
all the buttons were available you get

00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,220
monstrous stuff you get pages that look

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,040
exactly like somebody wanted them to at

00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,560
the very moment they were created but

00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,740
the problem is is all of that crap

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,280
that's being does being built a breaks

00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,320
the

00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,539
minute anything changes in the design

00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,330
that's assuming that the people with

00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:37,130
that direct markup control are very

00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:39,530
scrupulous and always make sure that

00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,210
their work perfectly matches the design

00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,409
standards and the design guide for the

00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,789
website because that that's what

00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:46,430
everyone with the WYSIWYG editor does

00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:48,710
right you know they look up the brand

00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:51,440
guidelines and then make sure they've

00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,210
got the right styles and you know if

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,590
there's anything that they don't see any

00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,180
guidelines for they go to whoever

00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:59,750
designed the website and they make sure

00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:01,430
it'll fit in well yeah but then even if

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,810
they're even assuming that best-case

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,240
scenario the minute that site gets

00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:08,060
redesigned all of that market that they

00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,280
put in there is just dumb raw markup

00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,740
that has to go back in the edited be

00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:17,540
updated even assuming that you have the

00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:19,850
regular expression guru you know ultra

00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,850
genius that's still a huge amount of

00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:25,460
work to do on any site the other one is

00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:29,000
that content reuse suffers massively in

00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:30,920
Drupal we I think we practice tons of

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,660
content reuse without even really

00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,339
thinking about it in the way that like

00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,990
the larger content strategy community

00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:38,540
works the ability to create a piece of

00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:40,970
content show its title and a sidebar

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,860
list of links show a teaser for it on

00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,990
another listing page show a full version

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,640
have different permutations at that

00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,350
piece of content being displayed in

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,600
different ways in different places and

00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:52,430
to edit one single piece of content and

00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,000
have all of those things reflect those

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:58,040
changes that's content reuse at its

00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,050
basic for now that doesn't even account

00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,120
for things like going and repurposing

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,070
that content on other websites pushing

00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,050
it out to other platforms via you know

00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:09,470
feeds like RSS and stuff like that but

00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:14,810
once all of that stuff gets baked into

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:16,490
the content the body field Ryu suffers

00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,290
massively because it doesn't fit with

00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,300
other designs it may you know break

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:22,220
other websites all kinds of nasty stuff

00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,080
and then finally this is one has been a

00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,300
really really big issue over the past

00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,610
couple of years as everyone and their

00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,830
dog gets a mobile phone that has a web

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,570
browser and everyone starts using it

00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:35,540
instead of all their other computers or

00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:38,420
whatever that kind of design the

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,040
handcrafted artisanal web design jammed

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:43,670
into a WYSIWYG editor or whatever

00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:46,759
that tends to break mobile browsers or

00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:51,529
tablet browsers or telephone browsers or

00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:53,389
Google glass or whatever random crap

00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:55,759
people decide they're going to want to

00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:59,389
access content from at this point that's

00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:01,120
not even a annoying edge case the number

00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:04,790
of users who are using mobile phones

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,279
primarily or even exclusively is rising

00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,019
steadily over time especially if you're

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,850
in an organization that really cares

00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:13,310
about accessibility or there are legal

00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:15,769
requirements about how your content can

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:19,519
be accessed this is a huge huge issue

00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:22,910
and that's really the heart of it this

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,699
idea of an HTML page that we design and

00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:28,690
we create and throw out there to the

00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:31,310
wind it breaks in all those scenarios

00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:32,899
we've come up with awesome solutions to

00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:37,040
this in the web CMS world and especially

00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:38,360
in the Drupal world field API views we

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,339
have all of these tools that have been

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,130
present in our community for years that

00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:46,160
have made a better approach a chunkier

00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:48,110
approach create little blocks and put

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,880
them together and make your piece of

00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,190
content out of appt idle and a subject

00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,220
line and all that kind of stuff this is

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:57,620
a huge improvement it's I mean for

00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:01,069
people who remember being the webmaster

00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:03,620
of a web page or the homepage for your

00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:05,600
company or something like that you you

00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:08,120
remember how awful it was doing very

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,089
simple edits to the site and the kind of

00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,850
chunky field based approach that we use

00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:16,220
taking individual pieces of a type of

00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:18,470
content piping it through templates to

00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,060
handle all of the crafty you know the

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,610
cruft e markup that wraps those

00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:25,819
individual bits of content that's a big

00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:28,850
shift we've replaced this with wonderful

00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:32,860
things like this does that make

00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:34,630
everyone's heart just swell with joy

00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,480
awesome

00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:39,640
tastic it's enabled so many cool things

00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,670
and in the Drupal world we even have a

00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:45,550
really mature rich API that you can drop

00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:48,250
new kind types of fields new ways of

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:50,740
remix in them stuff like that the

00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:54,640
problem and there is still a problem

00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:56,590
with this is that as much as we try to

00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,770
chunk things up and is wonderful

00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:02,920
wonderful of a job as we do we still end

00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:05,440
up with these nasty crappy little mini

00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,860
blobs embedded inside of our wonderful

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,940
chunky content models which is where the

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:14,940
body field lives in one of those

00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:19,230
miniature blobs inside of the wonderful

00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:22,780
idyllic platonic chunky content and

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:26,320
that's why turning on the WYSIWYG yes I

00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:29,050
need a chorus and that's why turning on

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,300
the WYSIWYG editor in the body field is

00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:33,370
one of those incredibly common things

00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:36,130
because as much as we want to tease out

00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:38,940
all the individual stuff the body field

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:42,040
is where all kinds of things

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,960
unpredictable things stuff that we can't

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,120
really figure out what it's going to be

00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,950
until somebody tries to jam it in there

00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:53,130
that's the kind of stuff that lives in

00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:56,380
there and that's my worst case scenario

00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:58,090
I didn't introduce myself I'm Jeff eaten

00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,550
I work for a company called low about we

00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:05,440
do lots of large content websites Martha

00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:09,310
Stewart MSNBC mtv UK back in the day you

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:14,070
know like I stab you know WWE for people

00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,070
who like men throwing each other around

00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:24,070
indeed who doesn't one of the most

00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:27,340
common use cases we run into is yay

00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:30,880
hooray chunky content field stuff like

00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:34,360
that but um I really need to put these

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,270
three photos in a gallery right here in

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:40,420
the article it can't be in the sidebar

00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:42,400
it can't be you know automatically just

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,080
stuck in near the top of the page or

00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,089
something like that no it's I've written

00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,370
an article

00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:51,480
and at this point in the narrative flow

00:14:47,370 --> 00:15:04,259
of that article I really need this thing

00:14:51,480 --> 00:15:08,040
to live there and I tremble to think how

00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:12,360
much human energy has been lost trying

00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:15,809
to argue editorial teams and content

00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:18,839
creators out of that very simple need

00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:20,730
now do you really need it I'll bet I'll

00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,490
bet if we just always put it after the

00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:27,829
third paragraph that would be fine right

00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:30,240
no it turns out no as much as we can

00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:33,449
just we can push back and we can

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,519
negotiate that is a really really really

00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:38,009
common kind of problem and it's not

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,050
exclusive to photo galleries in news

00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:43,100
articles it occurs all over the place

00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:45,660
this is the harder problem although

00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,939
chunking things up and using templates

00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:50,639
to reshuffle and remix individual little

00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:52,079
pieces of content utilizing structured

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:59,610
content in that way that's given this

00:15:52,079 --> 00:16:02,579
huge huge gains but this remains the

00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:05,189
first element of this really tangley

00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:06,779
difficult problem is narrative text I

00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:10,410
don't necessarily mean like storytelling

00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:15,389
I mean some flow of text in which a

00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:18,059
human beings like narrative energy their

00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:22,290
creative telling of some sort of you

00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:24,420
know piece of information is important

00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,189
it's not simply being assembled out of

00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:30,089
individual little bits this is like a

00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:32,189
conversation or a sales pitch or a piece

00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,839
of news tell you know taking somebody

00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:36,569
through like you know the inverted

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,420
pyramid stuff like that something that a

00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:42,179
person is writing a common common cases

00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,309
that we end up seeing are like long long

00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:46,110
reports like there are you know a lot of

00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:48,449
federal agencies they publish their

00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:51,480
content on the web and they have huge

00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:54,000
reports that are basically a single long

00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,939
narrative document with all these pieces

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,600
whether it's complex figures and charts

00:16:56,939 --> 00:17:01,569
or data table

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,209
or pull quotes and statistics and stuff

00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:06,280
like that littered liberally throughout

00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:08,559
the flow of the document you can break

00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,169
it up into chapters you could if you

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,720
were really debauched you could try to

00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:15,819
break it up into pages like you know

00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,319
traditional you know like pages of a

00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:20,470
report or something like that but you'd

00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:23,949
still be left with the fact that there

00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:28,990
are islands of structure inside of that

00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:31,120
big flow of narrative and the placement

00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:34,120
of those little islands of structure

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,590
really really matters you could get away

00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,510
with putting them all in you know

00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:40,090
footnotes depending on how you're

00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:42,940
presenting it but it matters that you

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:46,210
know the reference to it at least lives

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:49,200
at a very specific place I I don't want

00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:52,630
to beat this horse too badly but like

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,210
these three things if you've only got

00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:57,909
two of these problems any two of them

00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,770
you can usually get around the real

00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:02,470
nastiness of it but if you've got all

00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:06,850
three of these things at once you're

00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:09,460
kind of screwed this is an example of a

00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,900
page from MSNBC com I keep vlogging that

00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,789
because it's a site that we just

00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,490
launched we're happy to talk about it

00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:17,260
stuff like that and this is a wonderful

00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:20,740
example of the problem like in its

00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:23,679
simplest form this is a picture of Pope

00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:26,380
Francis there's a little description of

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:29,559
the photograph there's credits for the

00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,480
photograph listing who took the photo in

00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:33,460
some cases there's also a title at the

00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,039
top of the photo sometimes there aren't

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,809
credits sometimes there's a link off to

00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:39,580
another story that the photo came from

00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:43,240
or something like that this is an island

00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:45,490
of structure it's got maybe four or five

00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,340
different little elements it has to go

00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:50,500
at that particular place in the story

00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:52,570
mmm I tried arguing with them about

00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:56,980
whether it really had to go there or not

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:59,860
but it turned out it had to and this is

00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:02,950
super common on news sites you know if

00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:05,950
we were just willing to have an image in

00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:08,190
there we could just say okay cool HTML

00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:10,360
tag HTML already handles that images

00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,140
congratulations and you know if we were

00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,090
really

00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,460
crafty we could say well I bet you could

00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:17,770
jam that entire caption into the title

00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,420
tag or maybe the alt tag of the image

00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:21,190
and then I bet we could just you know do

00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,440
something crafty with jquery and it'll

00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:27,220
reshuffle those but then where does good

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,680
credits go what what is credits in terms

00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:34,420
of like the altar title tag it it gets

00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:35,950
unwieldy really fast and if you've

00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,210
worked in like news publishing or

00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,370
anything like that you've heard people

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,590
like going on and on about the the

00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:45,240
snowfall article that the New York Times

00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:48,340
produced it was this giant intense

00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:51,520
multimedia experience talking about a

00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,560
group of hikers that you know got

00:19:51,520 --> 00:20:00,130
stranded in an avalanche in middle of

00:19:53,560 --> 00:20:04,000
the mountains gripping story it is

00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:05,830
filled with little bits like this the

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,260
first time a particular person gets

00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,970
mentioned in the article their name is

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:13,630
highlighted and over in the sidebar

00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:15,400
alongside alongside the portion of the

00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:18,280
article that talks about them there's a

00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,800
bio of them you know it's John he's 29

00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,360
he's an editor powder magazine and if

00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,430
you actually you know click on that it

00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,810
expands into a little you know bio some

00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:28,270
of them expand into little video

00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:30,340
interviews with the person all kinds of

00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:36,850
craziness cool stuff very very

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:39,100
compelling high engagement and then at

00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:41,080
various points illustrating important

00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,790
key you know pivotal moments in the

00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,130
story they have these little galleries

00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:47,680
embedded in it now Oh wonderful a

00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:49,660
gallery everyone loves galleries there's

00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,520
descriptions there's individual photos

00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,230
you know depending on what your device

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,000
you're on you can actually flip through

00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,620
them there or you could go to a

00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,850
different a little pop-up could display

00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,830
them there's all sorts of ways you could

00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,360
display a gallery but you know in this

00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:04,030
article they did it a certain way the

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,580
problem is a snowfall article was like

00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:08,710
this giant moonshot effort with like a

00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,990
pile of developers and front-end

00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:13,020
designers and writers and stuff like

00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:16,960
that this is not a sustainable

00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:19,990
reproducible kind of thing because all

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,600
of the random crap that had to be woven

00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:24,790
in here this was not a writing exercise

00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,490
this was not a Content product

00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:30,190
exercise this was a web development

00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:35,020
project in and of itself to create all

00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:37,180
of this stuff somebody out there is

00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,580
thinking aha that's why we need semantic

00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:44,650
HDR now then we can just CSS our way

00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:47,680
through all this stuff no no that is not

00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:51,430
the answer semantic HTML is great and I

00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:53,560
love the fact that CSS and you know a

00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:55,030
huge emphasis on browser standards and

00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,980
cross-browser compatibility has meant

00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:00,820
that we're no longer like jamming all

00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:03,070
kinds of crazy weird crappy cruft and

00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:05,050
pixel spacers and you know stuff like

00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,940
that into our HTML to make it just so

00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:11,080
but the problem is no matter how

00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:13,750
semantic our HTML is and this is I think

00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:18,820
about is semantics of a version of a

00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:26,160
photo galleries I could come up with son

00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:29,140
of a-- well i'm going to blame keynote i

00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:36,880
don't know why but that's just safe it's

00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:39,010
kino 60 that's a good one yeah always

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,690
leaving a misspelling so the client

00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:45,730
feels they can contribute to the meeting

00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:49,990
yeah that's well-played so barring the

00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:52,360
fact that this will break I think this

00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:56,080
is this is actually pretty semantic i'm

00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:58,990
using a figure tag inside of the figure

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,000
tag I've got an unordered list of links

00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:03,100
with images so each one of those images

00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,930
in my gallery links off to a separate

00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,090
page for the you know for the individual

00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:09,730
image I've got a caption here in a

00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:12,580
semantically appropriate fig caption tag

00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:15,310
it's all awesome there is like nothing

00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:17,800
in here that I could say is like design

00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:21,640
or presentation that's you know embedded

00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:24,670
in that except for the fact that there's

00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:28,030
three photos instead of five or two or

00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:29,560
seven there's a caption that is a

00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,050
snippet of tax to the links to another

00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:35,100
page as opposed to a longer narrative

00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:38,010
description or a title or credits

00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:40,770
there are design decisions deeply

00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:43,289
embedded in even the most semantic HTML

00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:46,350
and if I'm looking at something that can

00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:49,169
be reused or repurposed or you know or

00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:51,870
adapted in the future I need to think

00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:55,230
about not just how pure and perfect the

00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:57,539
HTML is but also what meaning I'm

00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:01,020
actually capturing with that pure and

00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:03,900
perfect HTML and that's that's a really

00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:07,159
big issue even with the most semantic

00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:10,679
sites no semantic HTML not the answer

00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:12,600
the deep problem that we keep facing is

00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:16,380
that there's a difference between

00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:19,620
browser meaning the primitive building

00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:24,030
blocks of an HTML page and content

00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:27,539
meaning the idea of a gallery is not

00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:30,179
something that HTML has a vocabulary for

00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:32,190
it has a vocabulary for the individual

00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:34,289
pieces that make up a particular

00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:36,179
presentation of a gallery and it's

00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:38,659
really good at that and we can solve

00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:41,640
that with you know semantic HTML CSS

00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:44,100
JavaScript stuff like that but it

00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:48,690
doesn't have any way to say I have a

00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:51,690
gallery it should go there this

00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:53,669
vocabulary mismatch goes all through the

00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,799
entire language that we're using to

00:24:53,669 --> 00:24:59,150
represent our content I don't want to

00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:01,860
knock on any of the really really useful

00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:04,080
additional semantic tags that have been

00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:06,900
added in the html5 standard but things

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,150
like aside which is great for you know

00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,340
call-outs and sidebar pieces and stuff

00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:14,010
like that doesn't necessarily capture

00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:17,309
that this is a teaser for an individual

00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:19,890
piece of content the the article tag in

00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:22,679
HTML 5 doesn't really distinguish

00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:26,010
whether something is an article in and

00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:28,169
of itself or a representation of another

00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,970
article that really lives somewhere else

00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:32,909
these are things that we have to build

00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:35,880
out of those HTML primitives things like

00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:38,730
a list versus a gallery or a paragraph

00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:41,909
versus something that is an author bio

00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:44,940
in the future if you decide that on your

00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:46,830
website what an author bio is and how it

00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,930
gets displayed and whether it always

00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:50,220
shows up or whether it needs a photo or

00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:52,940
whether it's just a link or something

00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:55,830
like that those are questions that are

00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:58,530
not really affecting whether an article

00:25:55,830 --> 00:26:00,540
has an author bio but they ripple out

00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:03,830
into design changes that gets us back

00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:12,540
into this whole structural HTML problem

00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:16,440
I'm going to quote myself here it's my

00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:18,180
presentation I can quote me HTML is rich

00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,550
enough for a designer to represent

00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:24,060
complex content but not precise enough

00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:26,970
to describe and store that content in a

00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:28,890
presentation independent form there's

00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:31,470
that vocabulary mismatch we were talking

00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:33,570
about and the real problem for us when

00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,830
we build content management systems or

00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:36,810
things that other people will be

00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:39,450
entering content into is that the

00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:41,940
WYSIWYG tools that they need to deal

00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:43,710
with these piles of HTML primitives that

00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,750
they're forced to use if they need to go

00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,660
beyond italicizing and underlining

00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:50,370
things is that the WYSIWYG tools were

00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,080
giving them actually can make the

00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:53,940
problem worse because rather than

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,940
shielding them from the complexity of

00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:59,280
HTML and the underlying little browser

00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:01,650
primitives that that HTML describes

00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:06,030
things in we're give we're making it

00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:08,280
easier for them to slam HTML primitives

00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:10,590
into a box using easy clickable buttons

00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:13,500
but they still have to figure out how

00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:16,140
the heck to build the conceptual content

00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,940
stuff they're told they need to make out

00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,800
of these primitives it's like giving

00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,410
someone a dictionary for the wrong

00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:25,050
language and asking them to go write an

00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:26,550
article that's the real heart of the

00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:29,550
WYSIWYG problem that we keep running

00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:32,490
into it's not that buttons are bad or

00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:36,020
easy as bad or people are lazy it's that

00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:39,480
we keep giving them the wrong tools and

00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:41,610
the results are predictable you know it

00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,670
doesn't necessarily mean that WYSIWYG

00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:46,650
editors are bad it just means that we

00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:49,020
have to think really really hard about

00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:52,020
what it is that we give people with them

00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:54,270
and also it means that simply stripping

00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:57,360
down the WYSIWYG editor so that all they

00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:59,820
have is like basic italicized format you

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,870
know and you know underlined link strong

00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,850
just doing that

00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:05,800
doesn't actually help that much because

00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:08,050
unless they're only editing extremely

00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,910
simple content when they need to

00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:12,400
actually represent this complex stuff

00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:15,130
that lives in the flow of their text

00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:19,450
well they're just going to come back and

00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:21,760
say I die I think I need a div tables

00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,590
can I put tables in there I need to put

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,260
things in there and we're going to get

00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:29,559
right back to it that's where the pure

00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:31,660
HTML the pure perfect markup in the body

00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:33,610
field thing usually ends up running a

00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:36,160
ground because at the end of the day

00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:39,280
people do need to put goofy things in

00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,380
there sometimes so meanwhile i said i

00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,840
was going to talk about did a and xml

00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:46,210
and all that crazy stuff has anybody

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,940
ever heard of ditta before or are they

00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:50,890
familiar with it okay oh wow awesome

00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:53,679
crowd thank you thank you for being did

00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:55,870
of people here it's the Darwin

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,750
information typing architecture it's

00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:02,230
like a particular variant of XML that

00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:04,360
was created initially for technical

00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,070
documentation and when I say technical

00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,929
documentation I don't mean like a blog

00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:13,360
post on how to use for API I mean like

00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:18,670
the manuals for a 747 that come on a

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:22,030
binder full of CD ROMs full of text like

00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:26,290
that's the kind of scale of content

00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:27,700
reuse and content validation that's the

00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:31,270
kind of stuff that did it was designed

00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:33,610
for an example would be I think most of

00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:38,140
the versions of the documentation for

00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:41,470
the adobe creative suite 14 languages

00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:44,320
two platforms God knows how many

00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:48,450
programs all of those were written and

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:52,720
edited in data it's a very very serious

00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:56,980
standard also it's all about lots of XML

00:29:52,720 --> 00:30:00,520
files sitting there and not really any

00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:02,050
concept of a database system so well the

00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,020
data people have figured out how to deal

00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:07,600
with all kinds of fluid dangly complex

00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:11,050
semi structured content in large

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:14,190
narrative flows we can still sort things

00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:17,299
without hiring a Java developer so

00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:19,620
let's not under play what we've achieved

00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:21,929
that's sort of my mental picture of the

00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,879
XML and in a world they're doing crazy

00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:26,519
things and they've got huge amounts of

00:30:23,879 --> 00:30:27,870
content but strangely enough there's

00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:30,450
like very very little communication

00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:33,179
between our worlds it's it's very very

00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:36,990
different this is an example of some

00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:39,360
data it looks like pretty familiar

00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:40,590
anybody who's worked with XML can

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,440
probably look at it and figure out

00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:47,309
what's going on here it's the main

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,990
wrapper tag here is a task and ended up

00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:51,840
because it's all about technical you

00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:54,090
know documentation task is one of the

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,679
top level primitive elements that you

00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:57,539
can use to describe stuff in your

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,220
content because you're often walking

00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:00,750
people through descriptions of a task

00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,240
that are about to perform and there's a

00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:06,480
title for the task and there's a task

00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:09,139
body element and inside of the task body

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:12,480
there are there's a steps wrapper and

00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:14,399
step one step two step three there's an

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,039
interesting little bit here you can put

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:21,120
an audience property on an individual

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:23,580
step element and say this step is only

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,320
for retail employees of my company but

00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:27,840
this step is only for corporate

00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:30,000
employees so when this document i'm

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,610
creating finally gets rendered out to

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,919
the final web page or printed out in a

00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:36,690
manual i could have the retail version

00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:39,029
of my manual and the corporate version

00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:41,429
of my manual or perhaps if i'm doing it

00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:42,960
on a web page if somebody's logged in as

00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:45,269
a corporate employer if they're logged

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,429
in as a retail employee I could switch

00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:49,649
those things as necessary and then down

00:31:47,429 --> 00:31:51,120
here after all the you know sand after

00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:53,519
all these tags are closed there's a

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,039
paragraph tag and it's gots weird little

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,649
attribute called a con ref in did a

00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:01,320
world that's a content reference so it's

00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:03,960
pointing at another xml file I think

00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,809
somewhere but it this is text that will

00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,820
be replaced by a boil it boilerplate

00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:12,480
legal disclaimer it has this idea of

00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:14,100
like placeholder stuff in your page that

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,590
what you're really doing is pointing to

00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:19,950
somewhere else in your pile of content

00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:21,629
and saying after all of these steps slap

00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:24,360
in the boilerplate legal text at the

00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:26,340
bottom now we're used to handling that

00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,430
stuff again with like templates or

00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,100
themes or

00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:31,660
or you know page level things that the

00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:34,000
content editor never needs to know about

00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:37,000
or never needs to care about but in

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,800
these large complex content scenarios

00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,740
where they're making this narrative flow

00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:44,440
things like that gallery that we were

00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:46,960
talking about earlier actually

00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,700
representing it with placeholders in the

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,880
flow of the document and dealing with

00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:55,180
its structural needs somewhere else kind

00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:58,390
of makes sense I think it's anybody's

00:32:55,180 --> 00:33:02,590
I'm leading towards I'm suckering you

00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:04,600
into agreeing with me so some of the

00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:07,090
really important principles that the

00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:11,650
data community and the xml community

00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:14,560
have internalized are one you model and

00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:20,590
store like in the actual markup of your

00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:22,810
documents only the meaning task step you

00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:25,480
know task body title things like that

00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:29,590
those are very precise terms that their

00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:32,380
community uses to explain what this

00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:34,690
thing I'm entering in is now how it'll

00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:37,330
look now not how I think it's going to

00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:40,150
be used nothing along those lines

00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:42,730
they're not using unordered lists or

00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:44,770
ordered lists to represent to represent

00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:47,620
those tasks because although an ordered

00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:50,260
list is handy that's not a series of

00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:52,180
steps we are asking you to perform it's

00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:57,180
just an ordered list and on or an

00:33:52,180 --> 00:34:00,280
ordered list you l.o.l whatever and

00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:02,590
that's a really important principle an

00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:06,220
example would be like a tag like warning

00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:07,780
and type of hardware and the content of

00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:11,170
that tag is the content of that element

00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:13,300
is do not turn off the server now if we

00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:15,250
were just you know throwing some content

00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,260
up there it'd be easy to say well how

00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:20,110
about we just wrap it in a span and put

00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:23,260
class hardware warning or something like

00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:25,810
that and from a pure HTML design

00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:29,620
perspective thinking in terms of someone

00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:31,930
who is making an HTML page that actually

00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:34,900
is perfectly fine but from a Content

00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:37,120
perspective a div with a class of

00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,649
hardware warning is not the same thing

00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,720
as a warning

00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:43,450
element with a particular type we're

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,520
capturing meaning here regardless of how

00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:48,460
it ends up getting processed and if

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,849
you've ever actually tried to like write

00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:53,829
jquery against stuff that people have

00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:55,029
had to enter in a WYSIWYG editor and

00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:57,160
they've been told that they're supposed

00:34:55,029 --> 00:34:58,480
to use certain styles or supposed to use

00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,710
in things to get it to behave properly

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,809
you classes while perfectly handy are

00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:06,940
not a great way to capture real

00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:09,460
structural meaning they're a great way

00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:11,619
to pass on information to CSS and even

00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:15,190
JavaScript and stuff like that but it's

00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:17,260
it's not perfect the second thing that's

00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:21,369
really really core in the Didache

00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:23,500
community and the XML world is the idea

00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:26,859
that they are they extend a core

00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:30,789
vocabulary rather than expecting one

00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:34,210
particular standard to encompass every

00:35:30,789 --> 00:35:37,359
single users terminal terminology needs

00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:40,690
and markup needs for example data

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:43,000
although it is not HTML still borrows a

00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:46,420
lot of the tags and element types from

00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,279
HTML things like am strong the P tag for

00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:52,329
wrapping paragraphs things like that it

00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:55,270
uses those and the core did a standard

00:35:52,329 --> 00:35:57,190
is it's assumed that you will that you

00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:59,260
will extend on top of it with what they

00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:01,150
call specializations for example

00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,910
technical documentation is what did it

00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:06,069
was originally designed for but

00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:08,109
documenting let's say the things that a

00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:10,089
hospital worker needs to do while

00:36:08,109 --> 00:36:12,700
they're on their job may imply

00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:14,230
completely other vocabulary that will

00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,119
need to be present in the mark-up for it

00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:18,369
to actually capture the structural

00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:20,319
meaning so there are lots of different

00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:22,660
industry specific specializations there

00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:25,240
and you can do things like use an a tag

00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:27,849
and you could add say an attribute like

00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,740
this is an unverified link or it's a

00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:31,690
link that we've already vetted you can

00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:35,799
add additional meany onto there beyond

00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:38,109
simply stylistic information in CSS but

00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:40,000
again the core idea is there's a

00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:42,369
consistent base before cab you Larry but

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,799
it's assumed that it will be extended

00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:46,240
with special for specialized needs the

00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:49,029
other one is they're big fans of

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,500
placeholder markup rather than embedding

00:36:49,029 --> 00:36:53,950
a giant blob of structure in

00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:56,990
side of something whenever possible

00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:59,930
place holders are used to pull in stuff

00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:01,850
from other content resources now in the

00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:03,800
XML world that usually means pointing to

00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:06,020
another XML document somewhere and

00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,720
embedding it inside of this document for

00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:11,750
us that can mean things like pull in a

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:14,000
node pulling node 23 and display its

00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:16,850
teaser inside of the body of node 48

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,590
because my gallery is over here but this

00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:20,420
is the note that I want to display it in

00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:23,120
or you could do things like you know

00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:25,730
show all of my attached image fields in

00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:27,320
a rotator right here rather than using

00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:29,540
the templates to display where you know

00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:32,060
to determine where they are I'll store

00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:36,130
them in a field but I'll show them right

00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:39,140
here in my document the other one is

00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:42,040
assume that there is an additional step

00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:44,990
beyond simply entering the content

00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:47,420
before it actually gets sent out to a

00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:50,660
browser or an iPhone or whatever it's

00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:53,210
the transformation step now in the XML

00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:54,980
world because there they are absolutely

00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:57,560
determined to capture nothing but pure

00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:59,420
meaning well of course you need to do

00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:02,000
some sort of post-processing to turn

00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:04,460
that into like an Adobe InDesign file

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,380
that can be sent to the printers or you

00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,720
know an HTML document that can be fired

00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:11,210
off to a browser but that idea of like

00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:14,120
expanding those placeholders into the

00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:17,540
final you know the final actual content

00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:19,880
or transforming something like a step in

00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:22,940
there you know multi step instructions

00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:25,040
into an unordered list with some extra

00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:27,580
spans and maybe an image tag to go along

00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,850
with it there's nothing wrong with with

00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:34,550
turning that meaningful markup into

00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:36,650
browser specific stuff as you go out the

00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:39,140
idea is that what people create and what

00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:41,450
you store isn't that final destination

00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:43,580
markup and the final one is that you

00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:46,670
tailor the editing tools that people are

00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:49,550
given to the vocabulary of their content

00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:52,370
not the vocabulary of a particular

00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:53,900
output format and this again is where

00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:55,700
the WYSIWYG thing keeps coming back to

00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:58,100
bite us because what we almost always

00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:01,430
end up doing is like turning on more

00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:02,780
HTML tags in the WYSIWYG editor rather

00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:04,490
than saying well okay what are you

00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,000
trying to do what are you not able to do

00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:07,040
with this

00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,350
oh you keep wanting to put in references

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,270
to books that are listed on amazon okay

00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:13,610
well we could put an Amazon book button

00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:15,620
in your WYSIWYG editor store a tag that

00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:18,470
just stores an Amazon product ID and

00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:20,240
we'll handle rendering it instead we say

00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:21,860
oh well okay we'll give you links will

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,090
give you images will let you float it

00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,160
left or float it right because you'll

00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:27,200
need to do that and they end up cobbling

00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:33,110
together those things out of those HTML

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:35,690
primitives everything I've described is

00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:39,470
wonderful and magical and you know full

00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:41,810
of full of wonderful unicorns but I'm

00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:43,370
guessing there are there is everyone

00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:46,850
already just convinced should I blow

00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:49,190
through this part I know Larry isn't

00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:50,990
just on principle Larry can't agree with

00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:53,780
me on something we have to battle it out

00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:55,220
so I'll go forward the first thing I

00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:57,920
want to make clear is this is not some

00:39:55,220 --> 00:40:00,830
sort of pie in the sky future scenario

00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:04,880
for us in the Drupal world and in the

00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:09,590
web CMS world this is an example of the

00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:11,780
I think token embed token entity insert

00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:13,190
module I can't read it has those three

00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:16,970
words I can't remember the order they're

00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:19,690
in it basically lets you use tokens like

00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:23,990
you know bracket embed node node ID

00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:25,430
inside of the body of content to do that

00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:27,260
sort of gallery embedding stuff we were

00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:28,610
talking about and there's even a button

00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:31,010
in the WYSIWYG editor that lets you

00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:32,870
click I want to embed a thing here it

00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:34,610
handles making the token for you and

00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:36,590
everything that's something that we

00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:38,090
already have we're already using on

00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:40,730
production sites that's actually what

00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:42,950
the MSNBC com project uses to solve this

00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:45,380
particular problem and it works well for

00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:46,760
them there's issues with using tokens

00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,130
that I'll get to in a little bit but

00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:52,460
that's very close to the kind of thing

00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:56,390
I'm talking about this is god help us

00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:58,300
the Wikipedia edit box although it is in

00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:00,740
by no stretch of the imagination

00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:03,380
beautiful although it is not a pretty

00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:05,930
editor and it doesn't even really do any

00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:07,670
post processing to format it the way

00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:11,450
that will look on a web page it's really

00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:13,640
raw text it's still a good assistive

00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:15,740
editor because all of the buttons that

00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,690
are up there all of the tools that it

00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,260
provides people who are editing text on

00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:21,740
a wiki

00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:24,200
iya aren't about HTML primitives they're

00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:26,750
about the specific vocabulary of editing

00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:29,270
text on Wikipedia so it's got drop downs

00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:32,390
for things like template placeholders

00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:33,980
for you know particular common bits of

00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:35,900
text that need to be entered on certain

00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,870
kinds of articles it's got things we're

00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:40,040
doing it you know elaborate

00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:42,820
cross-references between different kinds

00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:47,620
of documents the stuff that matters on

00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:50,060
Wikipedia is what this tool accounts for

00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:54,380
this although it's a little bit washed

00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:58,280
out is from a wordpress plugin called

00:41:54,380 --> 00:42:01,250
post snippets it's basically like a

00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:03,890
macro tool for wordpress you can define

00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:06,800
little short codes yourself like in this

00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:10,820
one I'm defining fig as a short code and

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:13,880
i can define you know any number of

00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:17,150
attributes that I can put on a fig tag

00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:18,980
and then I tell it what markup I want

00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:20,390
that expanded into when it's finally

00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:23,900
time to print the page this is a very

00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:27,950
simple example but I can say fig caption

00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:30,050
text you know and URL and it will expand

00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:32,510
that into a fully captioned you know

00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:34,670
figure caption image file stuff like

00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:37,100
that it can be used for all kinds of

00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:38,510
stuff but the idea is that the person

00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,040
entering things does it have to

00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:42,710
represent doesn't have to enter the

00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:45,710
whole structure and this module then

00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:48,680
adds a one click button to insert that

00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:51,310
short code in the in the text that's

00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,310
being edited

00:42:54,739 --> 00:43:00,509
this although it's a little hard to make

00:42:57,329 --> 00:43:03,329
out a little bit washed out is actually

00:43:00,509 --> 00:43:06,569
the code from the media module for

00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:08,969
Drupal 8 this is currently in progress

00:43:06,569 --> 00:43:12,739
it lives on github but it actually does

00:43:08,969 --> 00:43:15,839
work with the current alpha of Drupal 8

00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:19,559
basically it allows you to insert markup

00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:22,259
like this a div it uses data attribute

00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:25,469
tags for html5 to say this is an

00:43:22,259 --> 00:43:27,179
embedded node it's not-- ID 1 and I want

00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:29,849
the teaser view mode to be what's

00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:32,099
actually inserted and while I'm at it I

00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:34,739
also want to caption underneath that

00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:36,329
node now this is interesting because

00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:38,759
this one isn't being handled by the

00:43:36,329 --> 00:43:41,969
media module this is being handled by

00:43:38,759 --> 00:43:45,179
drupal's built-in captioned image plugin

00:43:41,969 --> 00:43:48,509
for the time i'm sorry for ck edit if

00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:51,359
any element has a data dash caption

00:43:48,509 --> 00:43:53,609
attribute on it Drupal is smart enough

00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:56,130
to use an input filter to expand it into

00:43:53,609 --> 00:43:57,869
a figure wrap the element in that and

00:43:56,130 --> 00:44:00,119
then put a fig caption tank underneath

00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:03,389
it with the caption and because it's

00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:05,130
using standard html5 markup stacking

00:44:03,389 --> 00:44:06,839
data attributes on to capture the

00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:10,199
meaning and the important information

00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:11,969
the media module pulling in a node and

00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:14,969
rendering its teaser inside of the body

00:44:11,969 --> 00:44:16,799
and the captioning tool knowing that it

00:44:14,969 --> 00:44:18,899
should wrap it in a figure tag and then

00:44:16,799 --> 00:44:20,609
put the caption underneath it both of

00:44:18,899 --> 00:44:22,529
those play nicely together although they

00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:23,999
don't have any actual pre-existing

00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:25,979
knowledge of each other they're both

00:44:23,999 --> 00:44:28,799
leveraging these tools and turning that

00:44:25,979 --> 00:44:31,679
very very streamlined meaning markup

00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:33,959
into the full complex markup and the

00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:36,869
cool thing is is if you actually go to

00:44:33,959 --> 00:44:39,419
the large page that has that embedded in

00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:41,189
place editing still works on the

00:44:39,419 --> 00:44:42,839
embedded node because it's still going

00:44:41,189 --> 00:44:45,689
through all the normal Drupal rendering

00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:48,689
layers if you embed node 2 on node1 you

00:44:45,689 --> 00:44:51,919
can go to node 1 and edit node 2 from it

00:44:48,689 --> 00:44:51,919
no deception

00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:58,270
this is an example that's I really love

00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:59,800
it's a particular ck editor plugin that

00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:07,150
for the math heads in the room you can

00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:11,230
enter pure text markup I know who likes

00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:14,530
math now the thing is if you actually

00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:16,270
gave someone HTML primitives to try to

00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:18,760
represent this stuff it would be crap

00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:20,560
they be due for wrapping stuff in spans

00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:24,670
trying to figure out how to align things

00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:26,050
size things or whatever but it turns out

00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:27,940
there's already a language called Tex

00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:30,520
that most of the people who care about

00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:32,859
doing that already know so this simply

00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:36,520
wraps something in a hey this is a chunk

00:45:32,859 --> 00:45:39,490
of text wrapper tag and renders it on

00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:41,920
output what you store is text markup

00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:43,930
what you get is wonderfully formatted

00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,400
stuff now if you were really crazy you

00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:47,050
could even do things like you know stuff

00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,460
that could be rendered into a 3d graph

00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:50,589
or something like that rather than

00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:53,290
simply an equation there are other

00:45:50,589 --> 00:45:55,780
libraries that let you actually do 3d

00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:59,230
rendering in the in the browser and you

00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:01,990
could if you wanted to build a layer

00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:03,069
that outputs stuff in that form too but

00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:04,720
the key is that you're storing the

00:46:03,069 --> 00:46:07,210
meaning and making the decision later

00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,369
about how to output it so how do we make

00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:14,250
this happen I've got I think what three

00:46:09,369 --> 00:46:17,230
minutes we can totally cover this so

00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:19,270
actually making it happen it's already

00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:21,430
something that's going on in bits and

00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:23,920
pieces here and there we're solving this

00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:27,000
problem of islands of structure inside

00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:29,079
of the body field in ways that work but

00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,329
ideally we'd also get on the same page

00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:32,770
so that whenever we encounter one of

00:46:31,329 --> 00:46:34,390
these weird little islands of structure

00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:36,940
problem we're solving it in the same way

00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:38,770
so that just like the media embedding

00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:40,030
and the captioning stuff just working

00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:42,310
together because they're on the same

00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:44,950
page all of our tools can do the same

00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:47,680
thing the first one is yes build on top

00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:49,599
of HTML like it or not we are a web

00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,550
publishing tool we manage lots of

00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,710
different kinds of content but for tools

00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:56,020
that for projects that Drupal is being

00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:57,849
used on most of the time the web is a

00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:59,440
pretty important component of it and

00:46:57,849 --> 00:47:02,770
there's nothing wrong with building on

00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:05,180
top of HTML the paragraph tag the M tag

00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:07,369
and the link tag do not need to be

00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:10,040
invented we don't need to go build a

00:47:07,369 --> 00:47:11,809
custom XML DTD from scratch before we

00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:15,260
give you no content editor as a field to

00:47:11,809 --> 00:47:17,510
enter things into the next one is to

00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:19,250
start using data attributes on our on

00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:21,200
the elements that are being entered into

00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:23,210
our content when there's stackable

00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,220
behaviors things that could apply to

00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:27,050
lots of different kinds of elements but

00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:29,690
we don't want to capture them the

00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:33,470
caption tag that applies to images or

00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:35,030
block quotes or code fragments and stuff

00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:36,710
like that is a great example other

00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:38,869
things that we've actually done for

00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:43,609
clients although sadly we can't release

00:47:38,869 --> 00:47:46,040
it nda's is an audience tag that we were

00:47:43,609 --> 00:47:48,230
able to add on to any element and let us

00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:50,630
choose like a drupal role that this

00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:52,880
particular snippet of text should be of

00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:54,980
should be visible to and in the WYSIWYG

00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,780
editor it was just a matter of creating

00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:58,910
a plug-in that added a span with a

00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:01,369
particular data attribute onto it let

00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:03,500
people select it right the CSS so that

00:48:01,369 --> 00:48:05,450
inside of the editor that text got

00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:07,760
special highlighting but when it was

00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:09,470
actually output a Drupal filter handled

00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,569
either removing it from the mark-up that

00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:12,859
was being shown or allowing it to stay

00:48:11,569 --> 00:48:14,780
there depending on the role of the

00:48:12,859 --> 00:48:16,940
viewer that's a simple behavior that

00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:18,710
could be used almost anywhere in the

00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:20,809
mark-up but once we DIMP lamented it

00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:22,670
it's stacked really nicely and because

00:48:20,809 --> 00:48:25,309
we were doing it with standard HTML data

00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:29,359
attributes it didn't collide with other

00:48:25,309 --> 00:48:32,210
things the other one is start accepting

00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:35,720
that defining a custom element may make

00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:38,869
sense for self-contained things that are

00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:41,000
an important unit of content that goes

00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:43,549
in there an example would be like a

00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,250
glossary term I want to insert our

00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:49,099
company's 800 number right here in the

00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:52,339
text but the 800 number differs from

00:48:49,099 --> 00:48:53,750
country to country or we need an icon

00:48:52,339 --> 00:48:55,609
next to it that indicates whether the

00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:57,170
call center is open or closed at the

00:48:55,609 --> 00:48:59,150
time that the person is viewing it

00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:01,190
that's all stuff that's very easy if

00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:03,619
you're using those kinds of placeholders

00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:05,359
but it's a huge huge pain if you're

00:49:03,619 --> 00:49:06,950
expecting people to actually create

00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,970
special markup to enable those things

00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:13,010
every time they type the 800 number and

00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:15,380
then the final one is except that this

00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:17,839
transformative step turning the

00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:18,990
meaningful markup that we're adding into

00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:21,210
the final destination

00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:23,430
markup that transformational step is not

00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:25,440
a sign that we haven't built a good

00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:27,030
enough WYSIWYG editor or we haven't

00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,280
given people powerful enough tools to

00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:30,869
edit it that's a good sign it means

00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,090
we're letting them edit what they need

00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:36,150
to and we're doing the hard work on

00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:38,400
output the cool part is is that there

00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:41,160
are lots and lots of options once we

00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,590
start using HTML stand html5 standards

00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:45,960
things like a Drupal filter can handle

00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:48,180
this post processing of turning you know

00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:52,200
simplified you know meaning markup into

00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:54,540
final HTML output in in symfony there's

00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:56,940
crazy stuff like response handlers that

00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:59,700
can even intercept the fully rendered

00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:01,770
Drupal page before it actually goes out

00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:03,540
over the wire and you could run a single

00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:05,400
regular expression over the whole thing

00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:06,869
and replace lots of different stuff all

00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,760
in one fell swoop if you don't want to

00:50:06,869 --> 00:50:11,400
use a Drupal filter you can write write

00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:13,440
jQuery plugins on the client side that

00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,660
pick up on particular data attributes or

00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,760
catch special tags that you've added in

00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:20,250
angular directives if anybody's been

00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,170
hearing about angularjs maybe you've

00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:24,810
probably stumbled over angled angularjs

00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:26,609
developers this week angular directives

00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:28,940
are all built around this idea of

00:50:26,609 --> 00:50:31,980
defining the behavior that a particular

00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:35,369
data attribute should add onto something

00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:37,890
on the client side you can also if

00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:40,230
you're outputting things to via content

00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:42,000
API or something like that when meaning

00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:44,490
is captured in this way it makes it much

00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,980
much easier to map the meaning that's

00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:49,230
inherent in your content to however the

00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:51,660
destination handles that particular

00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:53,760
meaning turning something into Jason or

00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:56,040
sending it over the wire to somebody who

00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,350
expects a very particular goofy XML

00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,940
format or something like that once you

00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:02,130
did once you determine to store the

00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:05,130
meaning rather than destination like

00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:10,770
markup in HTML mapping between formats

00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:14,880
gets way way easier so that's it store

00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:18,750
just the meaning in our markup tailor

00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:20,670
the quote WYSIWYG tools to the

00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:23,250
vocabulary of the content that people

00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:24,840
are using rather than the HTML

00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:27,869
primitives that we think it's going to

00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:29,940
be rendered to and accept that there's

00:51:27,869 --> 00:51:32,490
always going to be a transformative step

00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:36,150
to render things into the final

00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:38,420
national forum even if there's some HTML

00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:41,580
that's being entered into the body field

00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:43,920
and what we get from that is it's a lot

00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:46,400
easier to build tools that match the

00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:49,380
vocabulary of an organization's content

00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,780
that makes actually editing the content

00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:54,960
easier for people who aren't HTML

00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:56,550
designers but instead our domain experts

00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,140
on what the heck is going on inside of

00:51:56,550 --> 00:52:00,390
their company they understand that

00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:02,490
company's internal concept and what they

00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:05,970
deal with but they may not know how to

00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:07,320
turn that into an HTML design it gives

00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:10,920
us cleaner integration with external

00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:12,450
systems that aren't necessarily HTML or

00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,670
aren't necessarily using the same

00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:17,070
designs that we've got it actually makes

00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:20,130
WYSIWYG implementation simpler because

00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:22,650
keying on known data attributes or

00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:24,840
catching custom tags that we were using

00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:27,210
to capture that meaning it's a lot

00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:29,460
easier to write a WYSIWYG editor plugin

00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:31,619
the keys on those things then one that

00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:34,680
actually tries to become like a little

00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:37,619
dream weaver in a box inside of the body

00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:39,570
field and finally it gives us a much

00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:41,550
easier way to do a smooth transition

00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:44,670
into future standards things like web

00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:47,790
components and as angularjs is taking

00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:50,010
off more and more and more because we're

00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:52,170
capturing meaning and because we would

00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:55,230
be using things like html5 custom

00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:57,960
elements html5 data attributes we'd

00:52:55,230 --> 00:53:00,000
already be on the way to using the stuff

00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:03,450
that the future web is being built out

00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,310
of that's all really cool stuff that's

00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:06,990
all I've got here there's a bunch of

00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:09,990
stuff that I've been like fire hosing at

00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:11,600
you the media project is actually a

00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:14,790
really good place to look at right now

00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:16,619
as Drupal 8 evolves but again these are

00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:18,720
techniques that aren't restricted to

00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:20,970
some crazy point in the future these are

00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:22,680
stuff we can do now we can improve the

00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:25,250
lives of our editors and we can improve

00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:28,830
our own lives as we have to deal with

00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:31,760
crazy unpredictable design changes and

00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:36,050
stuff like that it's great stuff I think

00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:36,050
that's all I got thank you

00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:48,410
it looks like we've still got like eight

00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:52,130
minutes or so until until everybody

00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:54,499
turns into I don't know it's the last

00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:56,359
work day shoot anybody who wants to hang

00:53:54,499 --> 00:53:58,819
out here and talk about semi structured

00:53:56,359 --> 00:54:04,789
content let's do it no I mean are there

00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:06,049
any questions yeah well recently we're

00:54:04,789 --> 00:54:07,730
looking into alternatives to media

00:54:06,049 --> 00:54:10,249
module since it's totally messed up all

00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:12,499
the time in the WYSIWYG and we tried

00:54:10,249 --> 00:54:14,420
asset module which has been around for a

00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,859
really long time it was incredibly

00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:18,559
awesome and you can create different

00:54:15,859 --> 00:54:20,900
entity types and just put buttons for

00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:23,089
them in your WYSIWYG have you ever used

00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:24,920
that I have not actually used that I've

00:54:23,089 --> 00:54:27,529
mostly stuck with media module but that

00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:29,930
sounds very interesting awesome and it's

00:54:27,529 --> 00:54:32,119
like gorgeously designed and you can put

00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:33,710
captions on things and you can have

00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:35,960
great you know just any feel double

00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:38,450
entity and just shove it in your WYSIWYG

00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:40,759
and reuse them interesting that is

00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:42,650
actually what the media in eight project

00:54:40,759 --> 00:54:44,839
is doing its got that entity embed

00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:47,809
module but yeah I mean it's not so much

00:54:44,839 --> 00:54:50,269
that I'm you know I'm extremely like

00:54:47,809 --> 00:54:52,039
married to media module as the thing

00:54:50,269 --> 00:54:54,440
that must be used for it I thought that

00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:56,059
you know media module the Drupal 7 one

00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,410
was what you know the standard wasn't

00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:58,880
there must not be anything better out

00:54:57,410 --> 00:55:02,079
there because no one talks about it then

00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,079
try asset and it's like

00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:08,589
ah yes the two projects are actually

00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:12,420
collaborating under play so maybe that's

00:55:08,589 --> 00:55:12,420
where the combined awesomeness camp

00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:25,440
hello two questions well 1 question 1

00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:31,960
comment first question is short it is

00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:34,900
tokens I'm sorry no I mean it you mean

00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:38,799
our tokens an option for this so cans

00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:40,690
was the question I'll take liberties

00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:42,460
with the structure for a question and

00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:48,789
I'll just take it in and I'll take it

00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:51,430
where I want yes tokens as an

00:55:48,789 --> 00:55:54,039
alternative to embedding lots of you

00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:56,829
know large swathes of structural markup

00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:58,569
tokens today are still a really good

00:55:56,829 --> 00:56:01,539
alternative to that you know we're using

00:55:58,569 --> 00:56:03,849
them on the MSNBC project to do entity

00:56:01,539 --> 00:56:06,549
embedding inside of node bodies because

00:56:03,849 --> 00:56:08,710
well it's implemented and it works it

00:56:06,549 --> 00:56:10,329
exists it required zero code just

00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:12,760
installation and configuration of the

00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:15,279
WYSIWYG editor to be fair configuration

00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:18,609
of the WYSIWYG editor today is probably

00:56:15,279 --> 00:56:19,839
what like a person year yeah but I guess

00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:21,400
I guess maybe to make the question

00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:25,000
better like what are what are maybe

00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:26,730
shortcomings of those oh let me tell you

00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,130
about the shortcomings are token yeah

00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:31,779
one that bracketed syntax makes it

00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:34,270
really easy to recognize when you're

00:56:31,779 --> 00:56:36,220
like staring at markup and saying oh

00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:39,190
that's a Duncan right there the problem

00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:42,760
is is token is a string of colon

00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:45,130
delimited bits like this is an embed it

00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,809
is a node it is node one here is the

00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:49,240
caption for it also you should float it

00:56:46,809 --> 00:56:51,400
left the token API has no support for

00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:55,569
things like an optional parameter there

00:56:51,400 --> 00:57:01,000
or say a caption that includes a colon

00:56:55,569 --> 00:57:03,369
right because colon right there would

00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:06,730
like making those look more like HTML

00:57:03,369 --> 00:57:08,920
tags is that duplicating HTML or is that

00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:10,750
I don't think of my to visual yeah I

00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:13,930
don't visual distinction is customized

00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:17,170
yeah well I would say that the ideal is

00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:19,000
we create markup using HTML tags data

00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:22,569
attributes or even custom elements when

00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,309
it's you know justified and assume that

00:57:22,569 --> 00:57:26,200
that's how it will be stored if we want

00:57:24,309 --> 00:57:28,000
to represent them differently so people

00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:30,130
don't mess me so people don't confuse it

00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,020
then that's a perfectly legitimate use

00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:35,770
case for a WYSIWYG editor because the

00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:38,109
WYSIWYG editor can supply what that type

00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:42,309
of insertion placeholder should look

00:57:38,109 --> 00:57:44,230
like in the editor yeah and then do it

00:57:42,309 --> 00:57:46,089
some do some other completely different

00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:47,619
thing on output and that's where I'd

00:57:46,089 --> 00:57:50,079
like to think of a WYSIWYG editors

00:57:47,619 --> 00:57:52,540
really really proper role as being an

00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:55,809
assistive editor for the meaningful

00:57:52,540 --> 00:58:00,069
structure not like an in-browser design

00:57:55,809 --> 00:58:05,619
tool right okay and the criticism part

00:58:00,069 --> 00:58:09,369
is is the snug UGG here okay well for CS

00:58:05,619 --> 00:58:12,640
I was having this conversation with him

00:58:09,369 --> 00:58:16,780
about mark down and how friggin mark

00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:18,280
down and about how if Marquez incredible

00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:22,329
answer then you don't have this problem

00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:25,839
okay sure sure but the he was making the

00:58:22,329 --> 00:58:31,329
argument that and this is this just may

00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:36,099
be a rebuttal to some of these points

00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:39,750
but in the use case where you have

00:58:36,099 --> 00:58:43,599
people writing simple narrative content

00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:45,849
markdown is a solution yes in these

00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:48,730
cases where you have very complicated

00:58:45,849 --> 00:58:50,260
narrative things and this was his this

00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:54,309
is either his words I'm paraphrasing but

00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:56,319
he said those kinds of things you will

00:58:54,309 --> 00:58:59,619
never be able to abstract to the point

00:58:56,319 --> 00:59:03,339
where we can essentially empower anyone

00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:06,640
to create that kind of National

00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:09,760
Geographic looking layout well in a node

00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:11,349
and that's if you want to do that as a

00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,450
publisher you should hire someone who

00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:15,819
does so there you know a hierarchy of

00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:16,960
authors some of which you can do simple

00:59:15,819 --> 00:59:18,849
things from what you can do more

00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:21,160
complicated thing I concur yeah I

00:59:18,849 --> 00:59:22,960
actually agree and i'm going to toss you

00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:24,640
a pack of Skittles for providing a

00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,559
perfect opening to something that i did

00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:28,240
not have time to put into a

00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:30,510
representation directly i'll get off the

00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,510
Mike now

00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:37,450
so just to sort of summarize that the

00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:40,090
idea is because there is so much

00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:42,430
unpredictability and so much craziness

00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:44,950
that you could potentially try to jam

00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:47,410
into the body field essentially it's

00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:50,470
like just keep it as simple as possible

00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:55,620
and treat anything beyond like boom

00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:59,650
article as a special design challenge I

00:59:55,620 --> 01:00:02,170
am not quite as fatalistic about that I

00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:05,950
don't think that we can create just an

01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:08,650
arbitrarily flexible structure making

01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:11,080
thing that's not what I'm necessarily

01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:13,330
saying but rather I'm saying in most

01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:15,640
organizations there are lots of

01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:17,890
recurring patterns in the kinds of

01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:21,220
complex bits that get put in there and

01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:23,170
identifying those and making provisions

01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:25,660
for them with custom tags and assisted

01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:28,870
tools and stuff like that gives the

01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:31,390
flexibility so that everything doesn't

01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:33,940
ultimately drift into being one of those

01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:36,400
one-off give them a web designer because

01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:38,830
they need to write a news article kinds

01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:42,070
of scenarios I think it was the guardian

01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:44,620
actually I can remember it's either BBC

01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:46,360
or the Guardian they put up a really

01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:49,950
interesting article on their on their

01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:54,010
account of strategy tumblr go figure

01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:56,050
about what they call data picks it the

01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:58,540
idea is it was this recurring thing they

01:00:56,050 --> 01:01:02,080
first did in an article about like honey

01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:03,850
bee die-off but it was a way of sort of

01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:05,320
doing an infographic sort of doing a

01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:08,920
link and sort of doing information it

01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:11,980
was a photograph a statistic explanatory

01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:14,350
text and a citation link all wrapped in

01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:16,150
sort of a collection and they were just

01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:17,950
doing it as a one-off they had a web

01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:19,210
designer go in because the person who

01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:22,090
was writing the story said I really need

01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:23,710
some way to do this and then the minute

01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:25,210
they did it like they started getting

01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:27,550
requests everybody wanted one of those

01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:28,840
in their articles and after maybe you

01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:31,000
know a couple of weeks of getting lots

01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:32,230
and lots of requests they broke that out

01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,020
and they started treating it as a

01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:37,210
standardized piece of structure that

01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:40,270
could be done without any kind of manual

01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:42,580
design you know interference and I think

01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:43,300
that's actually the really really solid

01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:44,830
way for

01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:46,480
it's not so much that you plan

01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:47,920
everything else you know print plan

01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:51,220
everything out in some sort of giant you

01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:53,260
know content waterfall but rather when

01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:56,110
the special needs come up you deal with

01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:57,790
them but rather than just throwing HTML

01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:59,920
primitives at people and telling them to

01:01:57,790 --> 01:02:02,050
sort it out for themselves you help them

01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:06,040
and if it keeps being a need you

01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:08,080
automate it I think that's Justin I that

01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:10,030
that's my that's my standard answer on

01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:13,030
it but I definitely recommend looking up

01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:14,500
the data pics article as an example of

01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:16,810
how that can be an organic process

01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:18,640
rather than just like a giant develop a

01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:25,060
project where I think it's handed to an

01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:27,190
editor yes hi another potential solution

01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:30,640
to this problem full full disclosure i'm

01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:32,770
working on a control for ha implements

01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:36,660
this but i'm curious to know your

01:02:32,770 --> 01:02:38,830
thoughts is to take those mini blobs and

01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:43,030
transform them into a series of mini

01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:44,740
chunks I okay so actually this

01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:48,190
particular link the way you design web

01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:50,290
content is changing is all about that

01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:51,460
particular approach and I think there

01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:53,740
are a lot of scenarios where that's

01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:57,760
really really effective the challenge is

01:02:53,740 --> 01:03:00,280
if it's actually inside of a long piece

01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,020
of narrative text it can really

01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:04,060
seriously disrupt the experience of

01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:06,040
actually editing a name maintaining the

01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:07,870
narrative text itself because what

01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:10,030
you're doing is you're taking a story or

01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:13,150
an article and breaking it up into a

01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:16,420
bunch of really really distinctly

01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:18,820
separate like database II chunks that

01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:20,320
are reassembled by a template and it can

01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:21,910
be really good for things like you know

01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:24,010
product overview pages where you're

01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:25,450
essentially like stacking different

01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:28,720
actual chunks here's the product

01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:30,010
description I want a selling point about

01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,660
this particular feature selling point

01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:34,390
about this particular feature you know

01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:35,860
call to action and then details and I

01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:37,690
want marketing people to be able to come

01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:39,970
in and rearrange those or swap something

01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:41,980
in the middle but that's not quite the

01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:43,180
same and it's related and that's

01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:45,340
actually one of the reasons that i put

01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:47,860
this link in the slides I'll be pushing

01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:50,500
out the PDF but I think that's a good

01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:53,050
solution for certain types of problems

01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:55,150
but not quite the same thing for the

01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:56,150
pure narrative flow with embedded

01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:58,960
structure thing

01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:58,960
cool thanks

01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:10,170
Oh what Brian Hirsch White House web

01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,020
team thank you so much for your

01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:16,080
thoughtful presentation um you know so

01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:17,760
we are in the process of trying to go

01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:19,620
responsive with whitehouse gov and my

01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,060
mind is racing now with you know what

01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:23,340
would it look like to make a WYSIWYG

01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:25,320
that stores meaning you know and later

01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:27,090
gets transformed so here's a here's a

01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:29,760
half-baked idea to add to the list of

01:04:27,090 --> 01:04:31,260
possible those are the best kind so I

01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,540
you know I'd love to talk more with you

01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:35,340
at the bar anyone else who's interested

01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:37,260
about ways to do this so yesterday I

01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:39,000
attended a great presentation on ascetic

01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:41,430
which is going to be included in Drupal

01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,820
8 and that seems to me like it could be

01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:47,100
a compelling way to you know store store

01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:49,830
something meaningful somewhere I have no

01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:51,180
idea what ascetic is so ascetic is going

01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:54,090
to be used in Drupal 8 for asset

01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:57,630
management okay and so you know lower

01:04:54,090 --> 01:05:00,720
down in the stack then altering a fully

01:04:57,630 --> 01:05:05,550
rendered page in you know the symphony

01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:06,840
response on assets get grabbed by a set

01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:08,310
I really know very little about this

01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:11,400
this is a very it's a way of like

01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:13,680
capturing I want image blah and a set of

01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:15,060
candles oh that's on an Amazon s3 bucket

01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,410
or oh that's on your local dev

01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:18,180
workstation while you're working on it

01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:20,310
locally or something like that yeah but

01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:22,920
you can apply all kinds of things to

01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:24,690
transform it along the way yes that's in

01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:26,850
the slide on different ways that

01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:28,620
transformational step can happen that's

01:05:26,850 --> 01:05:30,210
you know like response lyst you know

01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:31,530
response handlers in Symphony are

01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:33,780
actually one of the ways that can do

01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:36,300
that initially I was thinking that some

01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:38,910
of the things that I'm trying to get

01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:41,550
done here are would require that

01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:42,870
approach in d8 but since then there's

01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:45,600
actually been some improvements to the

01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:47,370
filtering system that make it one of

01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:48,810
several options we have for doing that

01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:51,450
transformation on the server but yeah

01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:53,550
it's I I absolutely agree and I think

01:05:51,450 --> 01:05:55,730
there's a lot of scenarios where like an

01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:57,810
organization that has a lot of

01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:59,460
consistent needs like this that are

01:05:57,810 --> 01:06:01,380
going to be applied to a lot of pages it

01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:03,510
might actually be more efficient to

01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:05,730
build something like ascetic that they

01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:07,290
just pipe everything through rather than

01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:09,480
trying to go in and monkey around with

01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:11,460
all of their input filters and implement

01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:12,930
it in that way so the thing that last

01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:14,789
quick comment the thing that strikes me

01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:17,099
is potentially compelling about

01:06:14,789 --> 01:06:19,799
rather than the filtering system in

01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:21,779
Drupal is that you know ascetic the

01:06:19,799 --> 01:06:23,759
meaning that we're describing is generic

01:06:21,779 --> 01:06:26,130
right it's not tightly coupled to Drupal

01:06:23,759 --> 01:06:29,069
logic there's nothing no D about it or

01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:30,660
entity about it so you know to

01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:32,459
collaborate with a project like ascetic

01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:34,169
and make it a generic plug-in that can

01:06:32,459 --> 01:06:36,390
be used outside of Drupal also know that

01:06:34,169 --> 01:06:38,039
that that's an especially in large or

01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:40,769
large organizations to face this problem

01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:43,259
a lot they are they are likely to face

01:06:40,769 --> 01:06:45,419
the same transformation needs in things

01:06:43,259 --> 01:06:46,829
other than Drupal based websites so you

01:06:45,419 --> 01:06:48,630
know any ways that we can standardize

01:06:46,829 --> 01:06:50,400
that stuff whether it's web components

01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:52,439
or a standardized server-side tool that

01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:57,269
does that handling yeah that's big

01:06:52,439 --> 01:07:05,249
thumbs up thanks so I'm gonna give you a

01:06:57,269 --> 01:07:08,219
nice little softball haha so anyone

01:07:05,249 --> 01:07:11,189
who's dealt with clients who has had the

01:07:08,219 --> 01:07:13,229
conversation of no structured content

01:07:11,189 --> 01:07:16,319
it's a thing you're not doing

01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:19,380
Dreamweaver in the browser yeah and I

01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:21,900
see no but we won't Dreamweaver I or

01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:23,789
rather Microsoft Word yeah I need

01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:25,289
flexibility I don't get this structure

01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:27,299
thing mm-hmm yeah and a conversation

01:07:25,289 --> 01:07:30,119
with and flexibility is assembly

01:07:27,299 --> 01:07:32,309
language yeah I've had a conversation

01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:34,829
with and three-quarters of the clients

01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:36,509
that are dealt with at least and only

01:07:34,829 --> 01:07:41,400
some of them I'm able to convince

01:07:36,509 --> 01:07:43,019
because the others aren't listening this

01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:47,519
is how most of our Twitter arguments

01:07:43,019 --> 01:07:51,319
start this is going to be good so now

01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:56,069
we're adding another layer where we have

01:07:51,319 --> 01:07:58,529
chunks blobs structures within blobs

01:07:56,069 --> 01:08:00,779
those structures could be defined in

01:07:58,529 --> 01:08:04,130
line or reference to a chunk or blob

01:08:00,779 --> 01:08:06,709
elsewhere this poses an enormous

01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:09,119
usability problem for the content editor

01:08:06,709 --> 01:08:10,349
even assuming that you've been able to

01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:12,239
structure things from the developers

01:08:10,349 --> 01:08:13,890
leaving aside the developer challenges

01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:16,710
of building this and which are

01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:19,319
surmountable we're smart for editors the

01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:22,199
potential for inconsistency in the UI or

01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:23,579
in particularly in the UI is enormous

01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:25,290
when you have at least four different

01:08:23,579 --> 01:08:27,989
levels at which you could be thinking

01:08:25,290 --> 01:08:28,710
about what it is i'm typing where we

01:08:27,989 --> 01:08:32,520
have all those

01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:37,170
levels today we just only implement two

01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:41,160
of them I I guess I mean yes the answer

01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:43,770
is if we do a bad job on you I design

01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:47,040
the editorial experience will suffer but

01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:49,469
I think at least in my experience across

01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:53,069
a bunch of websites that's not something

01:08:49,469 --> 01:08:54,630
that we escape by not doing this I'm not

01:08:53,069 --> 01:08:56,640
suggesting we don't write I'm just

01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:58,920
saying how do we sell it how totally

01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:01,529
plan ahead as we cut it you've got a

01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:04,109
node edit form you've got the body field

01:09:01,529 --> 01:09:05,700
in it you've got this button that gives

01:09:04,109 --> 01:09:07,319
you a pop-up within it that may be

01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:10,440
referencing something else or maybe

01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:11,670
something that in line and sometimes

01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:15,390
you'll want one sometimes you want the

01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:16,739
other teaching the content editors when

01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:19,560
they're going to be using which one and

01:09:16,739 --> 01:09:21,719
explaining to them why you know in this

01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,339
this use case it makes sense to do this

01:09:21,719 --> 01:09:25,650
of those five options of this one in

01:09:23,339 --> 01:09:28,140
that and making that predictable that

01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:31,259
poses an enormous UX challenge i would

01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:32,520
say that starting a job i'm not going to

01:09:31,259 --> 01:09:34,650
disagree with you I'm just saying that's

01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:36,870
a challenge that should not be

01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:43,160
overlooked no I I don't think it should

01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:43,160
be overlooked but right I mean

01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:49,780
but yes the that was a in the background

01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:51,370
someone who's saying that's the same the

01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:53,380
same problem that the clients face with

01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:54,880
the print process and we've seen that

01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:57,730
Trent same transition was responsive

01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:59,050
design with designers who've come in

01:09:57,730 --> 01:10:00,940
from a print background and aren't

01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:04,210
familiar or comfortable with the idea of

01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:06,100
making design systems that adapt there's

01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:07,600
I think it goes yeah it's a step beyond

01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:10,060
that because it's more people who have

01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:12,250
to deal with more levels of question as

01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:14,740
they're entering content I would say

01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:17,230
that ideally they feel they would face

01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:19,690
fewer questions because the affordances

01:10:17,230 --> 01:10:21,360
they're offered in the UI correspond to

01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:24,100
the tasks they're being asked to perform

01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:26,170
rather than them being given HTML

01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:27,880
primitives and told to translate those

01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:30,070
to the tasks that they're being asked to

01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:32,740
perform and mapping those things

01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:34,780
correctly is like our job in the same

01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:36,100
way that figuring out what fields we're

01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:37,570
going to break out and what we're just

01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:39,760
going to allow in the body field as part

01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:42,700
of the modeling process figuring out

01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:44,230
that like oh hey they keep needed you

01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:46,090
know they they need to get recipes

01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:48,370
slapped in the side you know slapped

01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:50,020
into these articles all the time so

01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:51,910
we're going to make that something that

01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:54,100
there's a provision for rather than

01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:56,770
simply giving them a style guide and a

01:10:54,100 --> 01:11:00,010
bunch of HTML buttons that's the kind of

01:10:56,770 --> 01:11:01,600
shift that I'm talking about not

01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:03,880
necessarily like some sort of

01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:07,090
ideological mission to get xml in there

01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:09,460
or something it's because this approach

01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:11,350
allows us to simplify the problem space

01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:13,810
that they're presented with rather than

01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:16,300
expanding it then i'll give you the

01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:19,000
question i expects someone to ask if we

01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:21,940
build these wonderful body filled semi

01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:24,850
structural editing editing things client

01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:27,160
asks okay so why do I have any fields on

01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:30,760
my note other than the body what's your

01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:32,920
answer for supporting assets that don't

01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:35,410
need to actually live at a particular

01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:37,090
place in there for metadata that may not

01:11:35,410 --> 01:11:38,590
actually appear as part of the body

01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:41,290
field you know there's a number of

01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:43,540
reasons why having a separate box on the

01:11:41,290 --> 01:11:45,940
input form is actually beneficial to

01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:48,100
editors a prompt for a file upload is

01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:51,460
different than just you know a giant bin

01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:53,470
I mean some people may be perfectly

01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:55,330
happy with just a giant bin and

01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:56,860
supporting tools that do structure in

01:11:55,330 --> 01:11:58,040
there but again it's like you know

01:11:56,860 --> 01:12:02,260
that's the way the the

01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:05,900
xml document oriented community does

01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:07,730
content editing and we don't have to

01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:08,900
hire Java developers to sort things so

01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:13,160
there's a benefit to having a database

01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:17,300
to go along with that microphone Oh

01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:21,290
microphone while he's coming up to the

01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:26,360
mics there uh Oh Donna IL it is like

01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:28,580
Donahue can we assume our content

01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:32,290
editors know about the content they're

01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:38,000
creating and not assume they're morons

01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:41,210
well that's a tough not right there but

01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:44,030
again even assuming that a content

01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:45,740
editor is literally coming in fresh off

01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:47,780
the street knows nothing about the

01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:50,810
business knows nothing about HTML I

01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:53,570
think that if the affordances we provide

01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:55,850
to them correspond to the business that

01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:57,950
and what its needs are to the content

01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:59,510
they're expected to produce rather than

01:12:57,950 --> 01:13:01,370
being HTML primitives that they're

01:12:59,510 --> 01:13:03,080
expected to build that content out of I

01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:04,760
still think we're closer and the

01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:08,660
training challenge is at least simpler

01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:10,400
than than what we have today I only have

01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:12,380
one quick thing to interject and that's

01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:15,230
that my experience with content editors

01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:17,300
is that you can give them a node or

01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:19,250
content edit screen that's a mile and a

01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:20,780
half long and they will be fine with it

01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:22,520
as long as it meets their needs and has

01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:24,320
everything that they're after yes it's

01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:27,470
it that's been my experience to the

01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:30,650
problem is never this is so long rather

01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:32,270
it's this isn't what I'm trying to do

01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:34,910
there's all these fields that don't

01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:38,840
correspond to what I care about and that

01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:40,670
actually matters way more I think I'll

01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:43,220
get asked me to the flip side of the

01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:50,570
question that Larry asked so we so in

01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:52,520
Drupal we have sown Jubal we have you

01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:55,250
know enemy types and reels at a field

01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:57,260
you I and God and western right and so

01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:59,000
right you can make you can make this you

01:13:57,260 --> 01:14:00,320
know different view modes and configure

01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,060
exactly how you want something to look

01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:03,650
as a teaser versus another thing then

01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:05,750
you can build views off of all that and

01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:08,000
just to interject the media module that

01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:09,830
embeds entities inside of other entities

01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,570
one of the things that it ships with is

01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:13,460
an embedded

01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:15,140
splay mode so you can even set up a

01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:16,880
display mode for when this entity is

01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:18,320
embedded somewhere else it doesn't just

01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,090
have to be the teaser I can explicitly

01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:23,570
say what an embedded version looks like

01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:25,520
so that I think that ties in yes okay uh

01:14:23,570 --> 01:14:27,170
so you know so did is great because it

01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:29,180
has this concept where you can build you

01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:32,930
know task list for some values are great

01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:35,060
yes it also to be fair did as namespace

01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:39,080
include something like I think two or

01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:42,140
three hundred basic tag types so it's

01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:44,900
it's complicated so I think a lot of use

01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:46,850
cases could be solved with you know

01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:48,980
build you know build out node bundles

01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:51,380
build outfield collection bundles build

01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:52,820
views if you really need a custom entity

01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:54,410
type that's not well represented with a

01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:55,910
note or a field collection build a

01:14:54,410 --> 01:14:57,500
custom entity type and then bundles off

01:14:55,910 --> 01:14:59,630
of that and if you need that stuff to

01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:01,310
live inside of narrative flow than you

01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:02,990
then you embed via them you know the

01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:04,670
immediate or whatever who taught you you

01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:06,500
and bad you know an entity you embed I

01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:08,420
feel that's on the same note that you're

01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:10,850
you're on or are you in bed of you and

01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:12,950
in that in that world the concept of an

01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:15,050
entity or the concept of a node becomes

01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:18,470
sort of like a manifest for a particular

01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:20,480
piece of content its narratives that it

01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:22,190
has supporting elements that it has

01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:24,470
whether it's references or media

01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:27,020
elements and stuff like that yeah so my

01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:30,470
question is what what do you see as a

01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:34,610
use case for then building a special

01:15:30,470 --> 01:15:37,100
like WYSIWYG plugin that captures like

01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:39,410
some kind of did a meaning in something

01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:41,720
that's not an entity or field collection

01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:43,130
in exam like one of the examples I fall

01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:45,680
back on is I'm I wrote an article for

01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:48,830
for a blog that had a very specific

01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:51,250
house style for how citations of

01:15:48,830 --> 01:15:54,500
articles elsewhere we're supposed to be

01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:56,420
created they didn't just want a link off

01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:58,610
of the off there they wanted the actual

01:15:56,420 --> 01:16:00,800
originally published title they wanted

01:15:58,610 --> 01:16:03,170
the URL they wanted the author's name

01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:05,510
they wanted a date and they wanted it

01:16:03,170 --> 01:16:07,580
inside of a particular span structure so

01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:08,750
that their current design could do some

01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:10,160
special handling of that that they

01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:12,350
wanted that's not like they didn't

01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:14,510
correspond to any particular tag like a

01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:15,920
site tag or something like that and they

01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:17,360
hadn't broken that out into like

01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:19,310
separate fields or something they just

01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:21,830
wanted when you referred to an external

01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:23,850
site in some way all of that stuff got

01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:26,940
captured and it was a huge pain

01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:28,710
and it was just on the side of does it

01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:30,420
really make sense to like make that a

01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:33,210
separate field and then have an embed

01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:35,430
code for that that in my opinion might

01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:38,490
be a useful case we're creating like a

01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:39,690
house style tag where you've just got

01:16:38,490 --> 01:16:41,730
attributes that you dumped all those

01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:43,950
things into there's a WYSIWYG editor the

01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:47,130
same way we have a link you know editor

01:16:43,950 --> 01:16:48,750
in it was in a WYSIWYG tool and then it

01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:50,760
gets exploded into whatever structural

01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:52,170
markup that they need that's the kind of

01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:54,360
scenario where I think could be

01:16:52,170 --> 01:16:56,040
justifiable but in Drupal we have so

01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:58,470
many tools at our disposal to actually

01:16:56,040 --> 01:17:00,420
break structured things out in two

01:16:58,470 --> 01:17:03,060
separate little pieces and then insert

01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:05,550
them that I think that sort of embedding

01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:06,750
of a field or embedding of an individual

01:17:05,550 --> 01:17:09,060
entity is probably going to be one of

01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:10,200
the things that we lean on a lot okay

01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:11,610
cool because I think for a lot of

01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:13,110
organizations especially like small and

01:17:11,610 --> 01:17:14,370
medium-sized ones you know they're not

01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:16,200
going to want to like be like oh I need

01:17:14,370 --> 01:17:18,990
to hire someone to build me a custom

01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:20,280
seek editor plugin for my version of a

01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:22,230
task list right and when they already

01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:25,020
have Drupal tools that let them and in

01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:29,490
addition like that post like that post

01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:31,260
snippets tool for WordPress it let you

01:17:29,490 --> 01:17:33,480
actually define some of those sort of

01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:36,630
house style expansion macros and stuff

01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:38,760
like that using just a you know using it

01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:41,610
admin page and I think that kind of

01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:43,440
approach could probably handle a lot of

01:17:41,610 --> 01:17:47,130
those weird middle ground cases while

01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:49,650
still enforcing standard structures yeah

01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:51,390
it so we're really not like Drupal is

01:17:49,650 --> 01:17:53,460
not really all that far no you know

01:17:51,390 --> 01:17:56,430
that's the thing it's like the answer is

01:17:53,460 --> 01:18:01,470
actually way simpler than describing the

01:17:56,430 --> 01:18:04,230
problem accurately thank you I don't

01:18:01,470 --> 01:18:06,270
know but it's it's fantastic so I'm just

01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:08,850
wondering with your token insert

01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:11,820
solution say I'm trying to do something

01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:14,580
as simple as enter like an image float

01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:16,350
right it's got a caption it's got some

01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:18,960
fields I don't want them to junk it up

01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:20,820
so I want it fielded is this the kind of

01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,070
thing like is that going to be an entity

01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:25,080
in and of itself or is that a field

01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:27,390
collection that that's the kind of stuff

01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:31,110
that the media team is heatedly debating

01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:33,480
right now but like um in d8 just in the

01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:35,780
core you know Drupal 8 core the way it

01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:38,630
ships the image

01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:41,660
like icon in the WYSIWYG editor is not

01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:44,230
just a standard ck plugin it's actually

01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:46,850
a Drupal specific insert an image

01:18:44,230 --> 01:18:50,000
wysiwyg editor plugin that does things

01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:52,430
like captioning the data attributes and

01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,490
when you hit say float left float right

01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:56,390
or Center it's not adding custom

01:18:54,490 --> 01:18:57,980
alignment attributes it's actually

01:18:56,390 --> 01:19:00,350
adding a data attribute that a filter

01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:02,150
post processes into that so that if it

01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:03,530
needs to change based on other needs I

01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:05,060
mean your Drupal core is already even

01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:07,760
doing some of that for simple solutions

01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:10,580
like that so on more complex solutions

01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:12,440
like a slideshow like on your MSNBC site

01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:14,420
what's the user experience like when

01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:16,970
they're creating that like it's it's

01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:18,950
just literally like an ad slideshow yeah

01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:20,990
it's not like having to go like oh crap

01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:23,870
I gotta go make my slideshow first so I

01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:25,310
can do my token well yeah right now they

01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:28,340
do have to create the slideshow first

01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:30,830
but that was that was more of a timeline

01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:32,270
question then is it possible question

01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:33,620
there's already a couple of different

01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:34,820
tools in the Drupal space like when

01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:38,030
you're creating something that's being

01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:40,910
referenced on node a you can go into a

01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:43,880
sub page and create node B before it

01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:46,100
gets referenced and that I think is just

01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:48,890
it's been done it's just the meat and

01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:50,690
potatoes work of you know wiring all the

01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:56,240
parts together on a particular project

01:19:50,690 --> 01:19:57,620
okay thank you so um III guess I was

01:19:56,240 --> 01:20:01,670
under the mistaken impression that you

01:19:57,620 --> 01:20:03,290
might be talking also about rdfa and and

01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:06,200
and and schema.org and how that relates

01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:08,480
to the structuring of data in the body

01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:09,950
field but you didn't really touch on

01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:13,370
that at all no I mean I think it's

01:20:09,950 --> 01:20:18,560
really cool that we that you know you

01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:20,660
know sort of adopting you know or if not

01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:22,250
adopting did you sort of emulate in

01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:24,590
certain side I want to be clear I'm not

01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:27,530
suggesting we adopted it there's a lot

01:20:24,590 --> 01:20:29,540
we can learn right exactly emulate are

01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:32,150
learning from standards but yeah you

01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:34,880
know but it seems to me that you know

01:20:32,150 --> 01:20:37,190
that sort of leads towards creating you

01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:39,800
know another sort of taxonomy of meaning

01:20:37,190 --> 01:20:41,660
through our markup where we have this

01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:45,369
great taxonomy of meeting from

01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:48,249
schema.org and why don't we

01:20:45,369 --> 01:20:50,139
you know use that also for this purpose

01:20:48,249 --> 01:20:53,199
I mean it can do too thick and do that

01:20:50,139 --> 01:20:55,840
it can it can serve the purpose of you

01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:58,239
know of describing things to external

01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:00,999
machines right yeah but it can also

01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:02,499
serve the purpose couldn't it I mean I

01:21:00,999 --> 01:21:05,979
posed the question couldn't it also

01:21:02,499 --> 01:21:09,039
serve the purpose of adding this level

01:21:05,979 --> 01:21:10,629
of meaning you know internally for the

01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:12,099
reuse of these things in the structuring

01:21:10,629 --> 01:21:14,469
of them yeah I mean I don't think those

01:21:12,099 --> 01:21:18,669
things are incompatible at all but the

01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:20,320
idea that what I'm hoping we can get

01:21:18,669 --> 01:21:22,449
away from is the idea that what we

01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:26,349
actually put in the body field while

01:21:22,449 --> 01:21:29,590
editing and persist to disk you know or

01:21:26,349 --> 01:21:31,030
memory if you're using maria DB or if

01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:33,099
you decide you want to save your notes

01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:35,469
to memcache because you're insane or

01:21:33,099 --> 01:21:37,929
something like that you know what's

01:21:35,469 --> 01:21:40,419
actually persisted does not have to have

01:21:37,929 --> 01:21:44,070
a one-to-one correlation with the actual

01:21:40,419 --> 01:21:48,429
output format and if using rdfa

01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:51,789
information on the in da at the content

01:21:48,429 --> 01:21:54,699
level captures the meaning that your

01:21:51,789 --> 01:21:56,590
editors need to capture then I would say

01:21:54,699 --> 01:21:58,679
that's perfectly reasonable and

01:21:56,590 --> 01:22:01,629
perfectly fine to use because ideally

01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:03,699
the specifics of what's being marked up

01:22:01,629 --> 01:22:05,709
underneath it could be transparent to

01:22:03,699 --> 01:22:07,899
someone who's using a WYSIWYG editor to

01:22:05,709 --> 01:22:10,119
actually do the input the challenge is

01:22:07,899 --> 01:22:12,179
when the tools that they're being asked

01:22:10,119 --> 01:22:15,669
to use to input it aren't actually

01:22:12,179 --> 01:22:17,079
corresponding well to the kinds of

01:22:15,669 --> 01:22:19,090
content meaning they're trying to encode

01:22:17,079 --> 01:22:21,249
does that make sense it does make sense

01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:23,800
does make sense I'm just concerned about

01:22:21,249 --> 01:22:26,409
the you know that you know we already

01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:28,360
have been working hard at you know I'll

01:22:26,409 --> 01:22:31,269
not me but you know score and all the

01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:33,429
week working hard royal have been where

01:22:31,269 --> 01:22:36,340
I haven't worked on anything I just make

01:22:33,429 --> 01:22:38,550
presentations so but you know other

01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:41,349
people are working really hard on

01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:43,539
getting you know on getting good

01:22:41,349 --> 01:22:47,439
usability around getting you know

01:22:43,539 --> 01:22:48,789
getting rdfa into our you know our mark

01:22:47,439 --> 01:22:50,979
I've been getting it linked it to

01:22:48,789 --> 01:22:53,320
schema.org so there's a level of meaning

01:22:50,979 --> 01:22:54,500
there already and if we want to use that

01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:56,390
level of meaning for

01:22:54,500 --> 01:23:00,830
for other things why do i add this other

01:22:56,390 --> 01:23:03,050
taxonomy of stuff well I mean that's

01:23:00,830 --> 01:23:06,500
that's a good question I like for

01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:08,000
example an author bio being inserted at

01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:12,200
the bottom of an article or something

01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:13,370
like that rdfa at least my understanding

01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:15,290
of it it's been a while since I've

01:23:13,370 --> 01:23:20,120
looked at it it's a means of

01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:23,810
communicating the meaning of random mark

01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:24,980
up to machines on on the other side so

01:23:23,810 --> 01:23:28,070
they can figure out what your actual

01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:31,820
intent in this blob of markup actually

01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:33,530
is right from a Content perspective that

01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:36,110
whole blob of markup might not even be

01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:38,810
what I deal with I may have just like

01:23:36,110 --> 01:23:43,010
the equivalent of like a token insertion

01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:46,280
type thing that says insert user 52 zio

01:23:43,010 --> 01:23:48,890
here and that tag that i'm using at the

01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:51,350
editing in the editing interface may

01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:53,840
never actually even be reflected in the

01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:56,270
final markup that that say a crawler

01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:58,310
sees it may be expanded into the mark-up

01:23:56,270 --> 01:24:02,030
that includes rdfa tags and stuff like

01:23:58,310 --> 01:24:04,190
that right but the but-but-but schema

01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:07,610
gives us things like bio and you know

01:24:04,190 --> 01:24:10,460
type of you know you know author and you

01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:14,030
know date and all kinds of you know that

01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:16,490
gives us all kinds of actual you know

01:24:14,030 --> 01:24:19,300
taxonomy for for describing these things

01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:19,300
yes you know

01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:34,360
right it's not it's mean it i guess in

01:24:31,390 --> 01:24:37,600
situations where the vocabulary that's

01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:39,760
being provided by like schema.org has a

01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:42,370
one-to-one correlation with what's being

01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:43,930
entered in by an actual editor and i

01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:45,670
would say by all means it makes sense to

01:24:43,930 --> 01:24:47,380
leverage that rather than going off and

01:24:45,670 --> 01:24:50,530
you know inventing our own custom tag

01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:51,940
type or something like that but i like

01:24:50,530 --> 01:24:53,470
to think of this as being more in line

01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:55,810
with things like you know the w3c

01:24:53,470 --> 01:24:58,210
standards on you know web components and

01:24:55,810 --> 01:25:00,520
stuff like that where you know well I

01:24:58,210 --> 01:25:02,830
don't want to insert a video I want to

01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:04,990
insert a photo gallery or something like

01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:07,450
that you know rather than trying to

01:25:04,990 --> 01:25:09,910
wrangle a pile of markup or something

01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:12,610
like that you would create a you know a

01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:14,350
gallery tag include the information

01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:16,150
that's necessary to be passed along to

01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:18,640
that web component and have it expanded

01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:21,340
their which but that web component may

01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:23,500
expand it into things that use rdfa tags

01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:25,270
on the individual elements like who is

01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:27,070
the person who took this photo you know

01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:28,510
what is the you know what are the that's

01:25:27,070 --> 01:25:31,180
the copyright on this photo and stuff

01:25:28,510 --> 01:25:33,790
like that it could absolutely be used

01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:36,130
but one of the advantages is that can be

01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:37,450
handled purely programmatically on you

01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:39,460
know the templating system and stuff

01:25:37,450 --> 01:25:42,100
like that even if the editing interface

01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:45,100
is as simple as gallery for needs to go

01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:52,480
here no yeah that makes that makes a lot

01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:54,580
of sense cool hello in a period that I

01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:57,010
work recently we have like this issue

01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:59,140
that you described that there are so

01:25:57,010 --> 01:26:01,480
many like images galleries and things

01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:03,130
that need to go in this exact place and

01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:05,470
we have the whole discussion about we

01:26:03,130 --> 01:26:06,640
should wake and our solution and I would

01:26:05,470 --> 01:26:10,450
like to know your thoughts about that

01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:13,630
was getting rid of it at all so what we

01:26:10,450 --> 01:26:16,210
did we ship I mean in the content types

01:26:13,630 --> 01:26:18,370
with refined so many like pieces fields

01:26:16,210 --> 01:26:20,310
individual fees for so many things where

01:26:18,370 --> 01:26:24,520
for the thing that needed to be dynamic

01:26:20,310 --> 01:26:27,250
well we we we did was like that dynamic

01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:29,710
body which actually was entity reference

01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:32,140
of pins and we created a whole set of

01:26:29,710 --> 01:26:33,870
beans where for example we needed a

01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:37,030
Twitter

01:26:33,870 --> 01:26:39,460
to show some tutors so that being only

01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:40,720
accepted that we handle and then in in

01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:44,670
the back end we make this transformation

01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:47,140
and present them as needed or if we need

01:26:44,670 --> 01:26:49,540
paragraph we need captions we need

01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:51,340
images further to the left or right that

01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:55,360
those are things that were defined like

01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:58,090
in that specific bins and I you know in

01:26:55,360 --> 01:27:00,400
that in a body where you are editing you

01:26:58,090 --> 01:27:03,780
just like a door reference those beans

01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:06,790
and then the whole thing's gets built so

01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:10,060
that's where that's what our solution

01:27:06,790 --> 01:27:12,010
but that worked great when testing well

01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:14,680
when we came out to you know move to

01:27:12,010 --> 01:27:17,200
production we have to import like twenty

01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:19,750
thousand articles and for each paragraph

01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:22,480
we had a been yeah and imagine like

01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:25,300
immature sliders and the whole thing so

01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:28,090
we ended up like with 50,000 beans yeah

01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:34,390
I needed to hook altered hook implement

01:27:28,090 --> 01:27:38,410
on to that for the log broke yeah

01:27:34,390 --> 01:27:40,210
so I mean that's that's I think that was

01:27:38,410 --> 01:27:41,920
sort of touches on what was mentioned in

01:27:40,210 --> 01:27:44,170
were the earlier questions you know that

01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:46,240
idea of like stacking reusable blocks

01:27:44,170 --> 01:27:48,010
and assembling pages out of them it can

01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:49,480
be really useful but when you find

01:27:48,010 --> 01:27:51,580
yourself in those situations where we've

01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:53,970
just got a pile of text and things need

01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:56,680
to live in them it can also mean that

01:27:53,970 --> 01:28:00,160
whatever entity you're breaking those

01:27:56,680 --> 01:28:02,980
pieces of text into suddenly you're just

01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:05,440
buried in them and that's one of the

01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:08,440
reasons that I like to see whether or

01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:10,570
not like you know an example might be

01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:12,790
you know tokens to embed a particular

01:28:10,570 --> 01:28:14,860
beam inside of the flow of text rather

01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:17,020
than actually breaking up all of the

01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:19,180
text into individual beans so like it's

01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:21,790
just text for the stuff that's just text

01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:23,590
but insert a Twitter feed stream right

01:28:21,790 --> 01:28:26,500
here or something like that can be

01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:28,810
handled using entities I one thing that

01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:31,180
D fellow de and unless in years lights

01:28:28,810 --> 01:28:34,690
that this was we see with things break

01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:37,930
mobile styles since we're using bean we

01:28:34,690 --> 01:28:39,460
were able to define for this beam how

01:28:37,930 --> 01:28:41,440
did you look like in the desktop version

01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:43,750
and in the mobile version yeah let's

01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:44,950
like encapsulate the responsive rules in

01:28:43,750 --> 01:28:47,530
the element so

01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:49,300
and that was really helpful but when you

01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:52,050
know when it is like in Peduto edits

01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:54,640
working I mean it's so core problem but

01:28:52,050 --> 01:28:57,100
it introduces so many things that we

01:28:54,640 --> 01:29:00,040
needed to take care of later than I mean

01:28:57,100 --> 01:29:02,050
maybe if we have like and I what I go to

01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:08,950
solution that would be really you know

01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:12,040
better but yeah well thank so help me

01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:13,540
out on this one should I be proud of you

01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:18,370
or disappointed in you that you have yet

01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:20,670
to use the word transclusion wow yeah

01:29:18,370 --> 01:29:24,040
transclusion we call it impending

01:29:20,670 --> 01:29:26,020
technically in like the you know in in

01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:28,470
the community of people who use words

01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:30,970
like transclusion casually this is

01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:33,640
transclusion it's taking a particular

01:29:30,970 --> 01:29:37,030
thing and including it inside of another

01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:39,160
thing via the use of some sort of tag or

01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:43,180
something like that yeah an actual

01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:45,910
question so one of the things we're also

01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:48,700
like 630 so anyone who feels the need to

01:29:45,910 --> 01:29:50,380
go and get a beer as welcome to I'm just

01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:54,570
going to be here so they cut the power I

01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:57,580
think you mentioned earlier that

01:29:54,570 --> 01:29:59,830
slopping classes on div elements is not

01:29:57,580 --> 01:30:01,470
actually a Content definition mechanism

01:29:59,830 --> 01:30:03,820
and I'm not going to disagree with that

01:30:01,470 --> 01:30:05,890
but at what point you say the same thing

01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:07,690
about slapping data attributes on a div

01:30:05,890 --> 01:30:10,630
is also not a data definition data

01:30:07,690 --> 01:30:13,180
attributes are at least name spaced you

01:30:10,630 --> 01:30:14,500
can have multiple ones of them to

01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:17,500
include data from different sources

01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:20,080
whereas classes are really just a giant

01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:22,510
pile that everyone's stack stuff into so

01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:24,280
theoretically like the same problem is

01:30:22,510 --> 01:30:26,500
there but you at least have the

01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:28,150
advantage of like you know you can

01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:30,790
define the data attribute that you need

01:30:28,150 --> 01:30:32,260
and populate it not worry about whether

01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:34,870
or not you're colliding with someone

01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:36,730
else's class or whatever random class

01:30:34,870 --> 01:30:38,890
the designer who is working on the front

01:30:36,730 --> 01:30:40,300
end style she happened to you you're

01:30:38,890 --> 01:30:43,180
less likely to fight with a theme or but

01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:45,130
otherwise it's the same problem it the

01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:47,140
very least kicks it down the can until

01:30:45,130 --> 01:30:48,730
you know we're all defining data

01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:50,860
attributes and there's dozens and dozens

01:30:48,730 --> 01:30:54,040
of those on a single element it could

01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:56,710
happen but it's better so what would you

01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:58,370
be your guideline for when slapping a

01:30:56,710 --> 01:31:00,530
data attribute on a div is sufficient

01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:03,050
versus defining your own custom elements

01:31:00,530 --> 01:31:04,760
mechanism thing well I know in some

01:31:03,050 --> 01:31:06,980
cases where people are just using data

01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:09,020
attributes regardless and just saying we

01:31:06,980 --> 01:31:11,300
use divs and I think that that works

01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:13,370
today but like the the rule of thumb

01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:15,620
that I that I I think I put in there was

01:31:13,370 --> 01:31:18,830
data attributes are good for things that

01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:21,470
stack like a thing that is captioned

01:31:18,830 --> 01:31:23,750
gets this data attribute rather than

01:31:21,470 --> 01:31:26,270
wrapping something in a custom caption

01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:29,360
tag or something like that you can then

01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:30,980
apply the captioning behavior to images

01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:33,890
galleries embedded nodes whatever

01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:36,650
whereas an individual freestanding thing

01:31:33,890 --> 01:31:39,830
itself like this is an embedded gallery

01:31:36,650 --> 01:31:42,980
I would never put gallery pneus onto a

01:31:39,830 --> 01:31:44,960
paragraph because by definition that

01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:47,120
paragraph would then become a gallery

01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:49,340
you know you would want to instead use

01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:50,510
the gallery tag inside of or between two

01:31:49,340 --> 01:31:52,340
paragraphs or something like that that's

01:31:50,510 --> 01:31:55,100
the rule of thumb that I tend to go

01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:57,740
towards but like this kind of question

01:31:55,100 --> 01:32:00,350
is the philosophical stuff that the XML

01:31:57,740 --> 01:32:02,660
and data communities like because they

01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:05,540
live in the world of markup but they

01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:08,870
need good solid meaningful structure

01:32:05,540 --> 01:32:11,300
like this is what they consider the work

01:32:08,870 --> 01:32:13,040
of content modeling when we think of it

01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:15,080
as what should be a field what should be

01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:17,390
a type they're thinking about those

01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:18,980
questions in terms of markup structures

01:32:17,390 --> 01:32:21,560
and like that's the kind of stuff that

01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:23,810
we can at least look at how they deal

01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:25,100
with those kinds of questions when we

01:32:23,810 --> 01:32:31,450
try to figure it out because they've

01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:36,020
been spending 20 years on it well isn't

01:32:31,450 --> 01:32:38,720
the transclusion notion the lower case

01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:42,140
token if you will Lori's tea yeah it's

01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:44,060
it's a bucketing mechanism where you can

01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:45,620
bring in content of some type and

01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:48,080
display it and whether it's an image

01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:53,270
with fields or some other kind of

01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:56,570
content holding just the token seems the

01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:58,550
right way to do it to me because it's at

01:32:56,570 --> 01:33:01,160
runtime that you have to do things like

01:32:58,550 --> 01:33:02,840
check for licensing or I mean all these

01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:04,730
other issues that will come up in

01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:06,830
enterprise content management but but

01:33:04,730 --> 01:33:08,960
our normal run-of-the-mill things do

01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:11,070
like putting an image in content area it

01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:14,070
just seems like that

01:33:11,070 --> 01:33:16,110
and that's that seems to be the way

01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:18,570
forward to solve putting in almost any

01:33:16,110 --> 01:33:20,520
kind of thing in a thing right we should

01:33:18,570 --> 01:33:22,260
probably use that tech right and then

01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:25,020
the classes would be the things that

01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:26,610
would be applied by the editor in order

01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:28,650
to do things like say i want this

01:33:26,610 --> 01:33:30,540
paragraph to be an intro or I want this

01:33:28,650 --> 01:33:33,240
paragraph to split into two columns on a

01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:35,730
wider screen those that's to bring the

01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:37,950
editorial design into the editorial

01:33:35,730 --> 01:33:40,260
content structure it seems like we have

01:33:37,950 --> 01:33:43,320
these things it's just the media module

01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:45,270
is not quite robust enough to yeah and I

01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:46,890
don't think that media module I think

01:33:45,270 --> 01:33:48,900
media module is an example of this

01:33:46,890 --> 01:33:51,270
technique being used effectively not the

01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:54,090
tool by which this technique will be

01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:56,520
applied in our case rice like the

01:33:54,090 --> 01:33:57,990
ability like um I mean there's some

01:33:56,520 --> 01:34:00,690
things that I don't think need to live

01:33:57,990 --> 01:34:02,310
inside of the markup flow like on the

01:34:00,690 --> 01:34:04,560
MSNBC project one of the things they

01:34:02,310 --> 01:34:08,160
wanted to do is editors when creating a

01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:11,730
news story had to be able to choose what

01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:15,840
should lead that story a video a still

01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:17,370
image a pull quote from the story that

01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:20,010
they thought was particularly like

01:34:17,370 --> 01:34:21,600
snappy it was all the same content type

01:34:20,010 --> 01:34:23,670
but one of the things that they chose

01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:25,830
one of the one of the metadata fields

01:34:23,670 --> 01:34:28,710
that they selected was what should the

01:34:25,830 --> 01:34:31,500
emphasis on this story be like photo

01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:36,060
quote whatever and that allowed them to

01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:39,570
sort of pass design ish kinds of

01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:41,220
decisions towards like was that design

01:34:39,570 --> 01:34:43,080
because it was still like the templating

01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:45,900
in the design system that handled what

01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:47,640
leading with the quote actually turns

01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:50,970
into but they were still making those

01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:52,680
decisions right and I think that's it's

01:34:50,970 --> 01:34:54,930
always going to be a fuzzy sort of line

01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:57,110
between what is design and what is you

01:34:54,930 --> 01:34:59,460
know meaning decision but there's

01:34:57,110 --> 01:35:01,950
there's a lot of room for improvement

01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:04,770
before we run into like the the pure

01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:08,180
platonic form of design and and meaning

01:35:04,770 --> 01:35:11,580
separation I think that'll never happen

01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:15,390
okay one more question so if anyone's

01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:17,250
done imports of other you know content

01:35:15,390 --> 01:35:22,440
that used to be some sort of version of

01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:23,880
HTML hell is other people's markup it's

01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:25,590
particularly challenging you have to go

01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:26,820
through if there are any images that

01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:28,650
were embedded is this a remote image

01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:30,180
that I can just keep their do I have to

01:35:28,650 --> 01:35:32,070
deal with this I mean but even with

01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:33,690
tokens right it's also very much pain in

01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:35,820
the ass to kind of all right this is no

01:35:33,690 --> 01:35:37,860
tidy for a face for using my great

01:35:35,820 --> 01:35:40,290
module and to be clear media module also

01:35:37,860 --> 01:35:42,030
lets you use you you IDs the actual

01:35:40,290 --> 01:35:44,490
unique identifier rather than just note

01:35:42,030 --> 01:35:46,620
IDs so like there there at least putting

01:35:44,490 --> 01:35:49,860
some thought into that kind of stuff and

01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:52,530
like like glossary text insertion and

01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:54,090
things like that when when we did do

01:35:52,530 --> 01:35:57,330
that for a client we used machine names

01:35:54,090 --> 01:35:59,640
on those things not IDs because saying

01:35:57,330 --> 01:36:02,790
insert the 800 number here is easier

01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:04,740
than insert glossary item 59 right just

01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:06,510
for a person from a parsing perspective

01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:08,910
if anybody else ever has to deal with

01:36:06,510 --> 01:36:11,340
that markup and then I think panel Iser

01:36:08,910 --> 01:36:13,680
has gone pretty far with ipe and

01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:15,270
penalize err obviously that doesn't get

01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:18,540
stored back into the body which can be

01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:20,310
good and bad but i think you know having

01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:21,630
that kind of functionality we could

01:36:20,310 --> 01:36:22,950
bring some of those components over and

01:36:21,630 --> 01:36:24,750
just kind of apply that to the body

01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:26,280
instead of just applying it to with the

01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:27,780
idea of having you the widgets that you

01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:29,580
can kind of pull into the box yeah and I

01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:32,340
think like the the framework that ck

01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:33,510
editor gives us in ck editor for and

01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:35,220
drupal 8 especially where the

01:36:33,510 --> 01:36:39,180
configuration is a lot more a lot more

01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:42,450
cleanly integrated ck editors like

01:36:39,180 --> 01:36:45,420
widgets system that allows you to have

01:36:42,450 --> 01:36:46,770
sort of a self-contained chunk inside of

01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:49,680
the WYSIWYG editor that gets its own

01:36:46,770 --> 01:36:51,720
code for manipulation and you know can

01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:54,270
have its own helper dialogues and stuff

01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:56,190
like that I think that is has the

01:36:54,270 --> 01:36:58,320
potential to be a really big tool in

01:36:56,190 --> 01:37:01,890
this for us to sort of like a sandbox a

01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:04,410
kind of complexity behind an embed tag

01:37:01,890 --> 01:37:06,090
or a very short specialized piece of

01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:09,500
structure and then give people a useful

01:37:06,090 --> 01:37:09,500
interface to manipulate that

01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:14,690
that kind of leads into my question you

01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:16,640
know do you really think WYSIWYG czar up

01:37:14,690 --> 01:37:19,010
to this because in my experience even

01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:21,110
anything above the even the most simple

01:37:19,010 --> 01:37:22,970
things lists and tables they still muck

01:37:21,110 --> 01:37:25,640
that stuff up do you really think

01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:28,490
they're up to this kind of complexity I

01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:31,310
think they're more up to this than they

01:37:28,490 --> 01:37:34,940
are reproducing the functionality of

01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:37,160
Dreamweaver you know it's I think there

01:37:34,940 --> 01:37:41,150
was a just an article that went up on

01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:43,700
medium medium com is has an amazingly

01:37:41,150 --> 01:37:46,460
light just super streamlined ultra

01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:48,080
minimalist in line WYSIWYG editor if you

01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:49,520
have permission to edit a document you

01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:52,040
can just click in it and start typing

01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:54,530
and select text and format it there's no

01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:55,760
barrier between the concept of a thing

01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:58,310
you're viewing anything you're editing

01:37:55,760 --> 01:38:00,380
if you have permission and the lead

01:37:58,310 --> 01:38:04,390
engineer on their WYSIWYG editor just

01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:06,800
wrote this long tirade on how incredibly

01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:08,780
horrifyingly terrible the content

01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:11,180
editable interface you know in the HTML

01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:12,800
spec is and what that just the whole

01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:14,630
idea is broken and all the stuff that

01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:16,940
has to be worked around I mean writing a

01:38:14,630 --> 01:38:19,670
useful WYSIWYG editor that lives in the

01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:22,520
browser is a non-trivial task and I

01:38:19,670 --> 01:38:24,860
would never wish it on anyone that I I

01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:26,840
mean god bless the ck team well that's

01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:29,270
what I'm looking at so you in your

01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:30,950
opinion ck editor is the best tool if we

01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:32,960
wanted to try and implement some of what

01:38:30,950 --> 01:38:35,030
you're talking about I personally think

01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:38,630
so having talked with the ck team their

01:38:35,030 --> 01:38:41,150
thinking is very much in line with this

01:38:38,630 --> 01:38:43,460
stuff in terms of like capturing meaning

01:38:41,150 --> 01:38:45,080
wherever possible presenting a useful

01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:47,030
editing interface for that meaning and

01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:49,910
then transforming on output they're

01:38:47,030 --> 01:38:51,770
definitely on board with that concept

01:38:49,910 --> 01:38:52,790
and they've built API to support that

01:38:51,770 --> 01:39:00,050
kind of stuff in their plug-in

01:38:52,790 --> 01:39:04,250
architecture hahaha crafty yes I work in

01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:06,530
a did a shop actually whoo I know and we

01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:10,790
have a tool that we use the did it

01:39:06,530 --> 01:39:12,980
editors call oxygen XML and which has an

01:39:10,790 --> 01:39:18,559
author mode which is a you know GUI mode

01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:21,649
and and our authors are

01:39:18,559 --> 01:39:25,429
you know electrical engineers their

01:39:21,649 --> 01:39:27,499
subject matter experts yes not CMS

01:39:25,429 --> 01:39:31,280
experts but you would think that they

01:39:27,499 --> 01:39:33,649
would appreciate structure well I uh

01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:36,499
saying the content authors appreciate

01:39:33,649 --> 01:39:38,569
structure right because the stuff that

01:39:36,499 --> 01:39:40,309
they design is modular right they have a

01:39:38,569 --> 01:39:41,809
piece of digital logic that does this

01:39:40,309 --> 01:39:44,510
I'm going to hook it up with this and it

01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:46,219
sits inside but they fight tooth and

01:39:44,510 --> 01:39:49,579
nail because they just want to write

01:39:46,219 --> 01:39:52,939
yeah like a word processor but no one

01:39:49,579 --> 01:39:55,969
downstream can benefit if it's just

01:39:52,939 --> 01:39:58,969
words yeah paragraphs so we've had to

01:39:55,969 --> 01:40:03,439
get sneaky with them by using all kinds

01:39:58,969 --> 01:40:05,479
of things like schema Tron and xpath so

01:40:03,439 --> 01:40:08,149
you can say it looks at the content and

01:40:05,479 --> 01:40:10,969
says if what they've done so far right

01:40:08,149 --> 01:40:13,789
matches this pattern then offer up these

01:40:10,969 --> 01:40:15,649
things as content completion wizards

01:40:13,789 --> 01:40:17,869
like you having a code editor it looks

01:40:15,649 --> 01:40:20,659
like your writing installation

01:40:17,869 --> 01:40:23,629
instructions hahaha but it's under the

01:40:20,659 --> 01:40:27,769
knee underneath it structured yes but

01:40:23,629 --> 01:40:29,329
and you it looks it looks he looks like

01:40:27,769 --> 01:40:32,599
you tried to write installation

01:40:29,329 --> 01:40:33,829
instructions I have falsetto too it's

01:40:32,599 --> 01:40:36,709
about as close as I can get to an animal

01:40:33,829 --> 01:40:42,039
or paperclip but yeah so it's it's um

01:40:36,709 --> 01:40:44,329
it's how to keep structure while not

01:40:42,039 --> 01:40:46,369
encumbering them with the stature and

01:40:44,329 --> 01:40:47,599
like the idea of a WYSIWYG editor where

01:40:46,369 --> 01:40:50,449
you use buttons do this that is

01:40:47,599 --> 01:40:53,030
currently the predominant mechanism for

01:40:50,449 --> 01:40:56,539
capturing meaning and I think that that

01:40:53,030 --> 01:40:58,550
kind of stuff if there are predictable

01:40:56,539 --> 01:41:00,949
enough things that you can recognize

01:40:58,550 --> 01:41:02,929
that's a really really cool approach to

01:41:00,949 --> 01:41:05,629
it but at the end of the day you want to

01:41:02,929 --> 01:41:08,089
make sure that you're storing structure

01:41:05,629 --> 01:41:09,319
that captures meaning even if from their

01:41:08,089 --> 01:41:11,329
experience it's just while I started

01:41:09,319 --> 01:41:12,739
writing this thing and no okay cool it

01:41:11,329 --> 01:41:16,399
was helpful for me you know that that's

01:41:12,739 --> 01:41:18,619
the ideal case but we also can't just

01:41:16,399 --> 01:41:20,389
magically do that until we figure out

01:41:18,619 --> 01:41:21,739
what the structures are that they're

01:41:20,389 --> 01:41:27,340
going to be inputting and what we want

01:41:21,739 --> 01:41:30,159
the destinations to be wait a minute

01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:33,580
I just wanted to this is just turning

01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:37,000
into a ba yeah the core conversation

01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:38,349
that's fair um and you did say that

01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,179
everyone can go to be or if they want to

01:41:38,349 --> 01:41:42,580
it's true I don't know what you people

01:41:40,179 --> 01:41:44,590
are doing here um I just wanted to

01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:46,780
follow up on the on the sort of WYSIWYG

01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:49,000
editor question and an answer there is

01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:50,440
you know drew the history of Drupal 8

01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,449
development has been a lot about you

01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:54,040
know how can Drupal collaborate with

01:41:52,449 --> 01:41:55,599
other projects we've heard a lot about

01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:56,830
that would you know done some great work

01:41:55,599 --> 01:41:59,020
in terms of the collaboration between

01:41:56,830 --> 01:42:00,760
Drupal and symphony but another area

01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:03,520
where that's happened is between Drupal

01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:04,869
8 and seek editors yeah the process you

01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:06,550
know we've been wanting a WYSIWYG editor

01:42:04,869 --> 01:42:08,440
in Drupal core for years but they were

01:42:06,550 --> 01:42:10,000
also terrible they were also terrible

01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:12,250
and in the process of trying to get in

01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:14,320
its Drupal a you know like ckeditor did

01:42:12,250 --> 01:42:17,020
a great job and there you know early

01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:18,670
releases of version 4 and then since

01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:20,500
they released four point 0 2 now where I

01:42:18,670 --> 01:42:22,869
think they're on 44 45 or something like

01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:24,849
that that's that's involved like over a

01:42:22,869 --> 01:42:26,500
year maybe a year to two years of really

01:42:24,849 --> 01:42:28,719
close collaboration between the ck team

01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:29,830
and a lot of Drupal developers and one

01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:31,330
of the things that we actually talked

01:42:29,830 --> 01:42:34,179
about in Prague which i think would just

01:42:31,330 --> 01:42:36,610
be the craziest thing ever is ckeditor

01:42:34,179 --> 01:42:38,050
even has like the kind of stuff that you

01:42:36,610 --> 01:42:40,630
would normally say oh well when somebody

01:42:38,050 --> 01:42:42,070
pastes HTML from Microsoft Word and you

01:42:40,630 --> 01:42:44,500
know we we want to scrub it into

01:42:42,070 --> 01:42:47,290
something clean well they've abstracted

01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:49,150
that step into a separate component of

01:42:47,290 --> 01:42:51,219
the ckeditor framework so you could do

01:42:49,150 --> 01:42:52,510
things like paste mark down in and it

01:42:51,219 --> 01:42:54,099
turns it into whatever you want the

01:42:52,510 --> 01:42:56,170
underlying markup to be or say you could

01:42:54,099 --> 01:42:59,650
write a plug-in that recognizes you are

01:42:56,170 --> 01:43:02,860
pasting a YouTube embed code and turns

01:42:59,650 --> 01:43:04,810
it into a media module embed code stuff

01:43:02,860 --> 01:43:06,670
like that is all possible and that's the

01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:09,250
idea of like providing the assistive

01:43:06,670 --> 01:43:11,050
layer on top of the underlying structure

01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:12,429
yes I just I think it's a really great

01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:14,320
example of like you were mentioning you

01:43:12,429 --> 01:43:15,790
know like the did people have figured

01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:17,170
out all sorts of interesting stuff but

01:43:15,790 --> 01:43:18,580
yeah while we and Drupal have figured

01:43:17,170 --> 01:43:19,900
out all sorts of interesting stuff and

01:43:18,580 --> 01:43:22,270
wouldn't it be cool to collaborate and

01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:23,500
see editor seek editor is an example

01:43:22,270 --> 01:43:25,360
where that's happened where the CIA team

01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:27,909
has been into the WYSIWYG world and

01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:29,530
figuring out how do you put a WYSIWYG

01:43:27,909 --> 01:43:30,460
editing into a browser and spend 10

01:43:29,530 --> 01:43:32,020
years you know figuring that out

01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:34,900
meanwhile in Drupal we've done a lot of

01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:36,400
thinking on content structuring so the

01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:37,929
last two years of the two teams actually

01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,720
working together to create a WYSIWYG

01:43:37,929 --> 01:43:40,370
editor

01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:42,500
that supports content structure and has

01:43:40,370 --> 01:43:46,430
really paid off yeah I mean as a WYSIWYG

01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:48,350
skeptic for a long long time I learning

01:43:46,430 --> 01:43:49,490
more and more about that and getting in

01:43:48,350 --> 01:43:51,080
at least watching some of those

01:43:49,490 --> 01:43:53,990
conversations unfold has been really

01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:55,700
encouraging because like the ck team in

01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:58,460
particular is really on board with the

01:43:55,700 --> 01:44:01,640
idea of building an assistive editor in

01:43:58,460 --> 01:44:06,910
the browser rather than you know a

01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:06,910
