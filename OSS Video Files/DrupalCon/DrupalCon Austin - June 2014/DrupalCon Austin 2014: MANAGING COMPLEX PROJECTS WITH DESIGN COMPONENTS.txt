Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: MANAGING COMPLEX PROJECTS WITH DESIGN COMPONENTS
Publication date: 2014-06-04
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: JohnAlbin
Our CSS sucks. We've been building sites for over a decade using crappy, ornamentation techniques and shoddy selectors. Our styles unintentional bleed across the site. Our stylesheets are fragile and unmaintainable and full of specificity landmines. Pandas wander alone in the wilderness.

But there's no need to drown ourselves in beer. New technologies like Web Components and new techniques like OOCSS, SMACSS and BEM show us that planning before building can make our projects maintainable, easier to debug, and smaller with reduced CSS file sizes.

This session will introduce the basic techniques for CSS layering and using design components, the heart of any front-end CSS project. We will also discuss CSS/Sass organization and tips to more easily implement these ideas.

okay hope you had a good lunch or at

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,830
least you know you're not starving

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:15,809
anymore my name is John Elvin Wilkins

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:18,990
and yeah i'm known as John album just

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:21,470
about everywhere i'm a senior front-end

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,570
developer i worked for previousnext now

00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:28,230
that's a drupal consulting company in

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:31,260
Australia and i live in taiwan and this

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:34,469
is a picture of me in Taiwan with lemurs

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:39,120
they're at a zoo but you know they're

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:40,500
not native there but one of the things

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,410
that I that I'd like to do is of course

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,809
is like make free software right that's

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,539
why we're here Drupal but I've also done

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:52,910
Zen grids this is a SAS system to allow

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:55,949
you to easily build responsive layout

00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:59,309
then there's normalized CSS for sass and

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:02,789
compass there's a sink theme for colic

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,739
waves and IRC client for mac get svn my

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,869
grade does if you have some legacy

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,390
subversion repositories convert them to

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,280
get I had like a thousand subversion

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,780
repositories lying around and of course

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:22,830
I've done the Zen team and a bunch of

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:24,180
Drupal modules so that's me hello but

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,770
i'm here today to talk about you know

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,950
design components but you know front-end

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:33,090
development okay and kind of crazy last

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:36,030
few years it's it feels like there's a

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,960
new thing every other week you know

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,310
there's there's gulp JSU's task runners

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,780
we're starting to do a lot of DevOps in

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,970
the front end in order to automate our

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,110
systems responsive design of course

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:51,420
still relatively new all these things it

00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:53,610
it's kind of crazy in it it's hard to

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,470
like try to see where we're headed when

00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:02,189
we were just trying to figure out what

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:04,409
the heck's going on right now right yeah

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,540
I usually like to start a lot of my

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,929
sessions with this quote are you new to

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,940
front end development right here's a

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,350
secret

00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:17,870
no one else really knows what they're

00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:20,240
doing either the good news is actually

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,890
that it's gotten gotten better I feel

00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,320
like I'm starting to figure out what I'm

00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,730
actually doing you know that's why I'm

00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,870
up here I'm going to sort of give you a

00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,220
little bit of knowledge from what I've

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:34,100
learned from being in the trenches and

00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:35,210
and because i have been able to feel

00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,070
like I've gotten a little bit of a

00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:39,080
handle what's going on I've started

00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:42,620
looking forward to make sure that we're

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,810
not you know going about like hey look

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,720
at this cool new thing it's called table

00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:51,470
base laughs right I don't want us to go

00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,690
down like the wrong path and I started

00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:57,980
started looking ahead and the thing that

00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:59,210
I see is basically web components how

00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,870
many people here haven't heard of web

00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:04,820
components to basically almost everybody

00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,850
has have heard about it there's a couple

00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:09,410
of really good the CSS tricks one is a

00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:12,260
great article that describes what web

00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,750
components are then of course there's

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:18,290
the actual spec it's it's a very new

00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,280
spec it's still being built if you want

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,170
to play around with it there's basically

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,300
JavaScript polyfills in order to do it

00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:25,100
because I don't think there's no there's

00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:28,670
no stable browser that actually has this

00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:34,580
implemented yet but basically what web

00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:35,720
components are is it the the HTML spec

00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,209
authors got the other in there like hey

00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,700
you know what web developers they really

00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:43,130
like these templating systems we should

00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:46,570
implement something like that in HTML so

00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,570
what web components are basically is

00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,590
they've taken this idea of like you know

00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:54,350
PHP and twig all of these things that

00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:56,420
are that are templating systems mustache

00:03:54,350 --> 00:04:00,560
all these things and said okay how do we

00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:02,209
implement at at the HTML level right and

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,390
for example you can do things like you

00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:09,140
can create your own tag that is called

00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:11,150
carousel right and it would include it

00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,540
wouldn't sort of encapsulate all the

00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,860
design and you know so the mark-up

00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,840
within that one tag so you just use it

00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:21,410
one tag and then all sudden it presents

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,180
all of the designs in configuration

00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,800
within it

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,750
kara so huh I'm more likely it's gonna

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,340
be like oh god oh god why did my client

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,630
list of me about carousels tag right but

00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:38,010
you can do something this with with with

00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:41,090
web components right what what could we

00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:44,960
learn from this right we we have

00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:48,660
reusable in repeatable components and

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,240
self-contained design right so within a

00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,800
single web component the CSS that's

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,850
specified there doesn't bleed outside it

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,040
it's just encapsulated right there and I

00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,690
feel like that's that's like the major

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,990
thing that we can we can actually do

00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:05,790
that now but without the web component

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,710
technology part and it will make sure

00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:11,090
that we're moving in the direction of

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,090
the new technology that's coming right

00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:20,550
so have we done things how are we doing

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,730
things how have we done stuff in the

00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,950
past and I include myself in this that

00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:30,980
haven't worked out for us right on CSS I

00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:37,320
think sort of our biggest sort of sin is

00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:38,730
CSS specificity Wars right this is the

00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:45,060
only cat gift in the entire presentation

00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:46,710
so don't worry if you like cat gifs i'm

00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:53,970
pretty sure dave reed is speaking some

00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:56,400
time in this conference yeah so what I

00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,290
mean specifically right so you write a

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,720
selector because these are the classes

00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:05,520
that Drupal gives you know I thought I'd

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:08,060
change these oh well whatever and so

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,920
you've used styling this this particular

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,120
link inside your menu like okay that

00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,760
looks great this is our my main

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,890
navigation perfect and then you realize

00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,920
oh over the sidebar I need a slightly

00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:22,920
different styling because it's different

00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,650
design okay I'll just I'll just right

00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,060
sidebar menu item may link right so it

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,040
gets more and more specific and I'm

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,720
having to undo styles from the previous

00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:36,320
rule in my sidebar and then you know

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,320
page 37

00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:45,050
some some manager decided it has to be

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:46,820
different on that page so you just you

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,410
keep writing more and more specific and

00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,830
you're having to override stuff and it

00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:53,419
just gets really messy and there are a

00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,430
couple of things wrong with here one of

00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:58,280
the specificity is just way too high and

00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:00,650
it gets out of control envy the it is

00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:04,900
because the order that our rule sets are

00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:08,720
in in the actual stylesheet matter and

00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:10,550
that's just bad oh yeah and you can

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,520
rewrite this in SAS like this and you're

00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,840
like oh this is better less typing what

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,090
the problem is all we've done is now

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,520
we're auto generating the same awful CSS

00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,320
that we were writing by hand before so

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,800
SAS doesn't fix this by itself it's a

00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:30,860
great tool but this is not the way to

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:34,789
fix this problem so you know part of

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:37,789
those overly you know specifics rule

00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:39,800
sets and selectors are also overly

00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:42,169
generic class names and Drupal has these

00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,240
and I'm sorry to say that I think maybe

00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:48,620
this one came from the Zen theme title

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,630
it's everywhere you know block title

00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,150
node title views title so if you want to

00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:56,360
apply a title styling what does that

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:58,370
mean it doesn't you have to specify like

00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,220
the context in which it means something

00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:04,750
and this is just this is crazy and then

00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,750
we have the same thing in for content

00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:11,150
block kinda nope this I apologize for

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,470
the title on that pretty much mine but

00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,919
the content want I don't know who did

00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:19,010
that too sometimes you just have to

00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:20,889
accept your mistakes and move on it

00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,889
seemed like a good idea at the time I

00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:23,889
apologize

00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,490
so today we're going to talk about

00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:34,760
design components and how to fix those

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:38,250
problems that we're having with our CSS

00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:41,370
and what am I talking about well

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,719
component is the same as there's like 80

00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,190
different articles that describe this

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,730
stuff you know but it's basically the

00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:51,830
same thing as object in OCS s by Nicole

00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:55,529
Sullivan module in Jonathan Snooks

00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:58,710
snacks block in block element modifier

00:08:55,529 --> 00:09:01,279
UI patterns these are these are all the

00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:05,670
same thing that's what a component is

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:08,279
and then the goals of our design

00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,230
components are to reduce the specificity

00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:12,660
right so instead of having like three

00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:16,050
different parts of our selector we want

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,430
to have a single class selector alright

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,600
we're also trying to reduce the

00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,880
applicability which means that we're

00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,040
trying to remove that context that the

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,140
required context wouldn't forget to do

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,550
the design we want we don't want to have

00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:30,060
to specify context at all like oh

00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:32,220
sidebar right don't do that just the

00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,950
single component class and then an

00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,880
improvement innate ability because we

00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:40,589
are making it easier to apply design and

00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:44,520
have it be repeatable that improves

00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:47,580
maintainability a lot so design design

00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:51,150
component one class one consistent style

00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:53,910
I don't care where on the page I am

00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,950
using you know the button class if I

00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,690
apply that class to a particular HTML

00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:05,100
element I wanted to have that style

00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:06,480
exactly okay and then we also have other

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,250
kinds of like here's some more examples

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,709
like nav bar tabs more link this is sort

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,880
of Drupal friendly these things can be

00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:18,660
components you can have a specific

00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:21,740
design for those things there's some

00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:25,260
other ones teaser exciting to have pager

00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:27,570
sort of things but you can also have

00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,160
like watermark bio breaking news what

00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,350
you're trying to do is you're trying to

00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,790
find you're trying to look I mean often

00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,709
times you're going to get like a

00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,310
complete page design from a designer

00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:37,590
right

00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,660
and you want to try to look through that

00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:42,060
design and pick out little Pete's that

00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,279
little pieces that could be repeatable

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,860
designs all right they may not ever be

00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:48,510
repeated again but they could be so like

00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,029
main navigation you're probably only

00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:53,130
gonna have that once on a page right but

00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:57,180
it's still a component you want to have

00:10:53,130 --> 00:11:05,310
it is somebody calling me Jesus that's

00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:06,450
my wife yeah sorry honey and she's in

00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:10,589
Taiwan I don't think she knows what time

00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:13,710
it is here all right so you want to have

00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:19,320
a single I gotta take my phone out of my

00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:22,980
pocket you want to have a single class

00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,470
that describes a single a specific

00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,120
design right and and these are you're

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:35,910
trying to make them sort of encapsulated

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:38,250
and it just does this one thing but I

00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,990
wanted to talk to you about like the

00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,910
semantics of this right what am I

00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:44,880
breaking news these aren't for the

00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:49,200
traditional Drupal ways of creating

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,880
classes rain it that's because of

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,220
semantics i mean everybody got to have a

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,440
semantic class right well this is my

00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,480
little mini rant about semantics

00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:00,150
semantics is this study of meaning so in

00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:05,910
order for its semantics class it has to

00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:10,410
have a meaning brilliant I'm gonna nom

00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:11,790
has more semantic than blah right

00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:14,550
because I'm nom everybody knows the

00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:20,040
cookie monster that has meaning that's a

00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:24,620
semantic class so as long as you don't

00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,620
name your classes but a little I'm good

00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,950
so our content semantics that's handled

00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,200
by html5 elements right if you want to

00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:40,300
describe your content you use an html5

00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:45,209
element to describe that content you

00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:47,620
know article headings h1 all that stuff

00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:49,630
so let's make our class names that were

00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:53,980
used for design component to be designed

00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:56,529
semantics ok so the class names become

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,209
meaningful to the designers and

00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:02,800
developers who are implementing the

00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:06,910
design on a you know semantic HTML 5

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:13,329
element set of markup right and the

00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:14,680
classes are all about the design smack

00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:18,339
so you've probably seen slide like this

00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:21,610
like 80 million times base layout module

00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:25,690
state theme actually I here isn't

00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:30,640
familiar with smacks okay a fair number

00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:33,250
of you so base layout module state theme

00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,779
it's like Jonathan Snuka looked at all

00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:41,950
the Drupal terms of how can I mess with

00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:44,500
them the most so much Rowland theme this

00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:47,589
is these are not good names for Drupal

00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:51,760
people so I'm going to be using this

00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:54,520
sort of modified version and we had a

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,529
big long debate Morton knife and a bunch

00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,000
of other people to try to come up with

00:13:56,529 --> 00:13:59,649
these sort of names and like decide

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,399
within the Drupal community this is how

00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:05,079
we're going to talk about snacks ok so

00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:06,760
basically out components state and skin

00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:11,350
and basically this is a way of sort of

00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:12,730
categorizing your styles and I'm going

00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:16,420
to skip over the explanation just for a

00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:18,520
second because I don't really like the

00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:21,070
way he's put this into these these five

00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,440
things I'd much rather have state and

00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,329
skin that they are part of components

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,820
and i'm not sure why they're giving sort

00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:30,130
of equal weight in this max organization

00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,870
of those five things right like a

00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:34,720
statements state and skin are really

00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,370
they're part of components so now i'll

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,500
describe base layout and components of a

00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:40,270
rest of you bae styling is basically

00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,830
it's just the styling that you apply to

00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:45,440
HTML elements so like if you want to

00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:49,130
you want to style a paragraph you pee

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,260
and give it that styling h1 what's the

00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:53,750
styling for H ones so all of your HTML

00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:56,900
elements dialing that's your base HTML

00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,790
element styling layout these are classes

00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,800
that you create that are specifically

00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,020
for moving big chunks of your page

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,280
around to do layout you know your

00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,930
responsive layout size of stuff so you

00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,940
have like a class that's called layout

00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:10,220
that three column or something and then

00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,720
it's you know that is for the wrapper

00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,820
and then you'll have like another class

00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,400
that specifies this is the left column

00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,740
inside that three column layouts so all

00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,380
of your classes for that are related to

00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:23,240
moving your page around pixel whip is

00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,130
giving a presentation later today I

00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,390
think I don't know what the time does

00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:31,280
anybody know what time it is his

00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:33,170
presentation it's next in here its next

00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,060
somewhere he's giving a presentation

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:40,070
Justin layout so go talk to him about

00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:41,780
that and and then components these are

00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:45,290
the design components is what the entire

00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:48,620
rest of the presentations about smacks

00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:49,700
is really good to start with and then as

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,100
you start to implement it you feel like

00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:56,050
there's some pieces missing and for me

00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:59,330
the pieces that we're missing were bem

00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:02,390
block element modifier so basically your

00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:04,910
components then become these described

00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:08,660
as these five things the actual sort of

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:11,600
base component elements modifiers States

00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,640
and skin I will talk specifically what

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,160
those are in the next slides so let's

00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,660
start with you know I I've given this

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,720
presentation a few times this is my

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:23,420
first time giving it a drupalcon and I

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,990
used to like show screenshots and I felt

00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:29,800
like the actual web design that was on

00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:32,120
the screen was messing with people's

00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,880
ability to understand these concepts

00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:40,400
because they're very new so I decided to

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:41,930
like make a visual analogy so the design

00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:48,220
that we're actually going to be doing

00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:52,310
today is the flower component so in

00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:55,010
order to I want so I've got the flower

00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:56,420
class and anytime I use that flower

00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,860
class anywhere on the page

00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,310
I want it to look exactly like that

00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:03,050
right so if I've got an h1 element and I

00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,459
apply a flower class it better look like

00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:08,569
that on my page or I've done something

00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:10,970
wrong and this can apply to any HTML

00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:13,069
element I don't care it's got to have

00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,020
that design when I apply this class

00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:17,990
that's what a design component is all

00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:19,790
about right and no other element is

00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:24,079
going to have a flower class unless I

00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:26,689
wanted it to have this design so instead

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:31,370
of having these highly specific

00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:33,830
selectors you know nav item a link we're

00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:37,100
converting the specificity from the

00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:40,850
selector into the actual naming of our

00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:46,970
design so the naming of our class is the

00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:51,770
specificity okay so this is the

00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:53,780
component flower so and and oftentimes

00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,970
will have this is the rather complex

00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:58,669
design so if we start to look at the

00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:01,700
individual elements of it it'll have

00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:05,419
like this requires several HTML elements

00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:08,390
to take my word for it so we start to

00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:10,460
look at that so like one of our divs or

00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:14,919
whatever html5 element is going to get

00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,919
the flowers underscore underscore petals

00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:20,000
this other one's gonna get underscoring

00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,820
square face applied to it so those

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,830
classes then are applied to individual

00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:27,710
elements within our design component

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:35,120
because we have this complex multi

00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:37,730
element design and I don't I don't want

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,630
you to think that you know these stem

00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:43,640
and leaves it feels like like leaves

00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:45,080
should be nested inside stem well I mean

00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,360
obviously you're positioning leaves

00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,830
relative the stem yes so it has to be

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,090
nested inside so you can do like

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,610
relative positioning or absolute

00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:54,919
positioning or something like that right

00:18:51,610 --> 00:19:00,320
but I don't want to have the naming of

00:18:54,919 --> 00:19:01,970
the class represent the HTML hierarchy I

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,040
don't want to do that so like I wouldn't

00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,870
want to do flower underscore underscore

00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,779
stamina score and score leaves to show

00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:12,129
that leaves or have to be under

00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:15,580
inside stem if you want to document that

00:19:12,129 --> 00:19:19,239
the leaves HTML element has to be inside

00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:23,320
the stem element you can create a style

00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:25,450
guide for that that this is a doing

00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,739
automated automatically generated style

00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:28,599
guides there's a really new thing that I

00:19:26,739 --> 00:19:30,129
just started doing it's great and it's

00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:32,830
perfect for this for documenting this

00:19:30,129 --> 00:19:34,509
kind of things but don't I seen people

00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,830
do this before don't create flower

00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:37,809
underscore underscore stem underscore

00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:41,159
underscore leaves because you've

00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:44,080
suddenly prevented me from from

00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:46,359
refactoring this design module so that

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,830
there's no longer there's a requirement

00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:49,929
that the HTML elements must be nested

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,899
right because the naming insists that

00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:54,820
they must be nested but we can no longer

00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:57,639
refactor this design component so that

00:19:54,820 --> 00:20:00,549
they're not nested right so just every

00:19:57,639 --> 00:20:02,139
single element is just specified using

00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:05,049
underscore underscore and then the name

00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:09,690
of the element and I would like to say

00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:09,690
that that this doesn't necessarily

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,809
suggest that there's that kind of HTML

00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:22,289
hierarchy right because you can also

00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:24,849
have a flower bed I'm just going to bed

00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:27,669
the flower gardens for bed is obviously

00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:30,549
a rapper right the flower goes inside

00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:35,259
the bed right well let's say we're doing

00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:37,929
like visually centering right so flower

00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:42,969
bed just happens to describe a rapper

00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:45,820
HTML element for the flower component so

00:20:42,969 --> 00:20:48,489
elements really there they're pieces of

00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:50,489
the design but they are they do not

00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:53,109
represent any sort of HTML hierarchy

00:20:50,489 --> 00:21:02,799
these are a loose collection of HTML

00:20:53,109 --> 00:21:03,969
elements modifier so we basically have

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,279
the same design here but was just

00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:09,450
modified slightly so there's a lot of

00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:12,789
CSS properties that can be reused right

00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:16,269
so if we instead of specifying just

00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:17,900
flour we specify dash dash Rose it's

00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:20,180
going to use most

00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,860
the CSS properties but then they'll be

00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:24,080
like an additional rule that that

00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:26,960
specifies how the Rose is slightly

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:30,010
different from the the base component

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:40,460
right this is a modified a variant

00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:47,870
component from the base component this

00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:50,330
is our hover state state is a really

00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:52,360
interesting one because states are

00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:56,540
basically there's three kinds of states

00:21:52,360 --> 00:22:01,550
you have you know states like this which

00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:03,700
are you know hover active link what I'm

00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:08,390
not linked but you know those kind of

00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:09,890
selectors then we also have JavaScript

00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:11,180
interaction so if there's some sort of

00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,370
JavaScript forget interaction where

00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:15,740
you're like you click on something and

00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,930
then it like ABS a class to modify the

00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:21,650
design slightly the way that you do that

00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:23,750
is like for example if we want to have

00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:26,120
some sort of JavaScript interaction here

00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:30,590
this could become Z is pollinating

00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:33,170
JavaScript interaction my design skills

00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:40,910
are not that good the flowers meant to

00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:42,740
look just as happy as the bee is then

00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:46,790
the bestest oh that's a second kind of

00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:48,620
state and the third kind of state is our

00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:51,560
media queries right those are also a

00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:56,810
kind of state of our component this is

00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:58,730
the desktop design mid with 48 ms so it

00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:03,350
just wraps around just like normal

00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:07,070
flower and we get this sort of slightly

00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:11,420
altered state when the media query

00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:13,820
applies and i would like to remind you

00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:18,230
that you know print styles those are

00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:20,960
also media queries so print styles like

00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:26,510
for example this is yeah there's our

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:29,470
print style pressed flower yeah this is

00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,470
just another kind of state

00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:34,880
and in the last part here of our design

00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:39,230
components kin this is something that

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,990
Jonathan Snuka added 22 smacks and it

00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:48,530
it's not done very often in design

00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:50,390
anymore is usually like the skins that

00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:51,680
they would have a yahoo for example I

00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,180
don't know if you remember this they

00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,070
don't do it anymore I don't think them

00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:57,020
if you went to like the yahoo homepage

00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:58,430
it was for like yellow colors and there

00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,710
you go to like yahoo finance it would

00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:04,190
like change globally everything would be

00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:08,420
like slightly green right so it's a way

00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:10,970
to modify a large set of design

00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:13,100
components with a single modifier else I

00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:14,990
don't have a picture of that I was like

00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,370
what am I gonna do like make it green

00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:18,350
and have a money symbol in the middle or

00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:21,920
something guy this isn't half of it

00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:25,280
broke my visual analogy so but i'll show

00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:29,030
you example in the next slide here so

00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:35,030
here's here's what we what we have all

00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:37,810
of these different parts component

00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:40,310
modifier so you notice that i put a

00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:42,230
single dash in here this is why we have

00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:44,600
doubled ashes here because sometimes

00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:47,350
you'll have a design element that you

00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:51,440
just can't figure out how to describe it

00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:53,330
semantically without using two words so

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,160
you just put a single dash in between

00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:57,070
the two words and not sort of indicate

00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,330
that this is the name of the component

00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:02,800
and then we'll put the double dash that

00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:05,330
becomes to show that there's a modifier

00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:09,650
so an alternate version of that same

00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:11,630
design double underscore then I mean

00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,740
that's why we have mm scores just too

00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,110
because this is with the double dashes

00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:17,060
and n elements you know sometimes an

00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:22,190
element woth also have two names or two

00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:24,770
boards that require it this is our

00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:26,480
JavaScript state here is state and you

00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:29,480
can see that it there's no space here

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,760
this class is is that on in the selector

00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:37,900
it's both of those classes are on the

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:40,820
exact same element hover and then media

00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:42,620
what whatever your media query is that

00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,130
wraps around it and then here's that the

00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,380
skin

00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:47,750
so you basically somewhere on your page

00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:50,150
you're applying a you know the skin

00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:54,170
class and it's altering all of your

00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:55,340
design components you know globally so

00:25:54,170 --> 00:26:02,600
these are the different ways that you

00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:05,930
specify web components using glasses go

00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:08,360
back here so one more look at this base

00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:10,430
layout components and components are

00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:26,210
broken down into components elements

00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:31,100
modifiers state and skin file

00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:35,210
organization I use a file organization

00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:38,990
that is broken down and basically the

00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:40,910
first three levels of snacks so our base

00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:42,500
Styles going to one folder layouts go

00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:47,060
into another folder components going

00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:50,480
into another folder and that works

00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:53,450
really well actually yeah here we go you

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:57,860
can see example so i use sass of course

00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:59,210
so have my my style.css file and then

00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,160
basically it's just sort of importing

00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:02,780
all the files from base and components

00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,480
and layouts but this is my file

00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:07,100
structure it's really simple this is

00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,130
these are the only levels of file

00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:13,010
structure that bead and the reason for

00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:15,380
that is because it surprisingly you you

00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:18,500
end up with just a whole ton of files

00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:21,320
inside components it's actually really

00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:23,120
easy to find stuff it's surprising it

00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:26,710
seems counterintuitive to if you have 80

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:29,750
files how am I going to find anything

00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:32,090
but I I tried this out for the first

00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:33,320
time on a project and then we had

00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:35,420
another front end developer come and

00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,510
come in during crunch time and he took a

00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:42,140
look at my files and he's like oh crap

00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:45,200
what did he do it and then basically he

00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,910
just did this he's like okay he had he

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,190
knew that he had to modify this one

00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:50,750
design so he looked at the page and it's

00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:53,150
like okay that thing and he inspected

00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:55,490
the Dom saw that there was a class

00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:56,480
applied to it and then you look for a

00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:59,630
file with that name

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,850
aim in the kimonos fuller and boom he

00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:05,240
knew exactly where to modify he found

00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:08,840
the exact file you need to modify so the

00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:11,720
file names are the names of the design

00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,330
components you see if we've got a whole

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,150
bunch of your hot audio button dialogue

00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:19,429
engagement badge feature divider feed

00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,929
icon feed some of these I would want to

00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:22,730
change of like I don't really like the

00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:24,440
way that works the way i named it

00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:27,590
originally but you know what it doesn't

00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:30,140
matter do not stress about what you

00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:32,960
actually name it you're just trying to

00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:35,210
give a sort of rough approximation of

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,870
what the design and cap slates because

00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:39,770
it's a visual design right maybe you

00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:41,390
won't come up with the best words

00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:44,360
originally it's ok you can refactor

00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:45,950
later if you want to it's more important

00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:51,500
to just start building out your site and

00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:53,450
recognizing the actual component than it

00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:57,380
is to worry about what the actual name

00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:59,330
is and it will take a lot of practice

00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,400
you'll get better at it as you do it and

00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,870
you realize that it really doesn't

00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:07,220
matter so much as long as you've sort of

00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:11,419
encapsulate the design it's not so bad

00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:17,660
here let's look at the the styles that s

00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:21,049
yes folder or style todd s yes file so

00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:23,000
i'm importing my innate file underscore

00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:26,630
in SE SS that's where basically I keep

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,100
all of my sass mix-ins variables where

00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:30,760
i'm importing all my compass modules

00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:35,510
whatever third party library that i need

00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:38,120
and then usually only have a normalized

00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:39,860
file inside my base styles so i take

00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,590
like normalize and then just pack it up

00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:46,100
because i want to have i wanna make sure

00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:48,890
that i have some styling on all HTML

00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:52,070
elements so i just take normalize and

00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:54,080
start adding in my styles for HTML

00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:56,960
elements and and the way that i usually

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,000
target or the way that I decide what is

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,730
the design that I'm going to use on HTML

00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,970
elements is to think about wysiwyg

00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:08,210
editors right because wysiwyg editors

00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:09,560
are usually horrible about trying to

00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:11,120
insert a class

00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,530
into whatever thing that you've just

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,490
typed or you know added to the page

00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:18,620
right so I just recognize that okay it's

00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:21,590
going to insert some standardized markup

00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:23,720
hopefully hopefully you know html5

00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:26,660
markup but it's gonna be really hard to

00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:29,390
insert the classes so what do I want all

00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:31,730
of my HTML elements to look like what

00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:35,750
design do I want them to have inside the

00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:40,220
body field and that becomes what I've

00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:41,630
specify in my base styling and then

00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:44,270
inside all my design components they're

00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:47,300
overriding that default but the WYSIWYG

00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:51,920
the body field that's getting the

00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:53,690
default design from base and layout

00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:58,600
rules like every single individual

00:30:53,690 --> 00:31:01,280
layout like it gets its own file right

00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,770
and i'll have like it's not even per

00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:06,170
page it's like i'll have a l dash header

00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:08,360
for example that's you know the layout

00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:10,370
for the header and how it sort of

00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:12,680
modifies itself as it goes across larger

00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:15,890
and larger screen sizes and all of that

00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:17,690
is encapsulated inside that file i'll

00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:20,120
have a footer one you know like I'm

00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:23,000
story pages on pages that are you know

00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:25,490
node story right i'll have like a story

00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,770
layout that works with those and on the

00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:31,130
layouts the panels layout that i use or

00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:33,340
whatever right and then find them where

00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:35,870
I'm just for importing all my components

00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:40,880
was right there it's really pretty

00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:44,570
simple I realized that I talked really

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:47,870
fast which is good because one of the

00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:49,360
things that I'd I didn't get to show you

00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:52,880
and I haven't really shown anybody is

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:55,340
the automated style guide so let me jump

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,470
out of my slides real fast and it feel

00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:03,770
to be plenty of time for for questions

00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:11,200
but one of the really useful things that

00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:15,170
I did recently on a project MSNBC com I

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,630
implemented a style guide an auto jetter

00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:20,310
a nice i'll guide

00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,310
and see if I can pull it up here

00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:56,230
it's really hard to see all the buttons

00:32:50,890 --> 00:33:05,770
are the single okay window reopen close

00:32:56,230 --> 00:33:10,000
to have the real here we go so this is

00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:13,360
the thing called KSS neath style I get

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,030
Smith style sheets and it's a way that

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,820
you can specify you can basically write

00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:21,760
some some comments inside your sass

00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:24,220
files and then you just run this tool

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,920
and you say okay that's where my sass

00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:31,480
files are this is where my generated CSS

00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:34,000
is now run right now and generate me a

00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:39,310
style guide a bunch of static HTML files

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:41,830
based off of that input and this is the

00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:42,850
the one that I did this is the only one

00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,850
that I've actually done because it just

00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:53,440
finish this project a couple months ago

00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:55,180
and in it it just gives me an example of

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,860
like what are the heading levels one

00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:59,500
look like and you can see you shows you

00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:02,410
the sort of example HTML that i'm using

00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,820
and then the actual style right here all

00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:06,070
right i mean this is real style because

00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:09,490
it's it's pulling in the generated CSS

00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:11,590
so this is the same CSS file that we're

00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:14,230
using for our theme on the drupal site

00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:20,380
so these aren't drupal pages but is the

00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:24,390
same CSS and the way that you specify

00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:24,390
that this is is actually really easy to

00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:50,550
we find that here we go ok so this site

00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:52,170
was broken up a little differently

00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:57,240
inside my base there was actually

00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:59,700
several files there so for heading 1 I

00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,740
basically have this little code comment

00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:05,280
at the very beginning here can you guys

00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:10,140
see that do I need a big bigger all

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:13,400
right so i specify i'll scroll this way

00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:16,050
it's a little higher i specified the

00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,090
that you know describe it's like this is

00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:21,600
heading 1 I given a sort of example

00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:23,220
markup and then just specify what

00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,610
section of the style guide I want this

00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:28,590
to appear in and because the comments

00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:31,710
are right next to the actual

00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:33,660
implementation I would have to be really

00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:35,430
really dumb not to update the docks when

00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,440
I update this style like if I have to

00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:40,050
modify this in some way that's relevant

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,480
to the documentation modify / just do it

00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:45,440
all at once and then just rerun the the

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:51,720
style guide generator tag or the script

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:54,720
right there's actual H is specified

00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,460
there's there's a ruby version of KSS

00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,080
which i could never get to work because

00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,780
it assumes way too much Ruby knowledge

00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:03,210
but there's also a no Jas implementation

00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:05,490
of it KSS node and that one actually

00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:08,040
worked when I tried it which you know

00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:11,090
very positive alright so node KSS is

00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:15,860
what I actually used to generate these

00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:20,790
and go back over here I can show you so

00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:24,030
base headings you know here's what links

00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:29,520
look like here's like an example section

00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:33,860
of text yeah I'm let's go over to our

00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,860
components so

00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:40,460
yeah some this one this dial god I

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,560
actually generated after the fact and I

00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:44,480
came on to the project very late too so

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,700
it's sort of exposed some interesting

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,280
bugs in our implementation for example

00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:52,010
this design component is applied with an

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,810
ID selector which I really hate but I

00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:56,720
didn't know that until I generated the

00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:58,880
style guide right so I would like this

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,160
to be a you know class logo instead of

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,080
an ID but this is the HTML that's

00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:12,880
required in order to get that that

00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:12,880
design right that's not very interesting

00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:22,220
there's a bunch of different styles

00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:26,870
classes are used for ads here's vertical

00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:28,880
styling on an ad the dotted lines I

00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:30,350
actually added to the example markup

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,800
just so you could see where the

00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:36,110
different pieces are so you can you can

00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,000
modify the example to add in some inline

00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:42,560
styles to make it easier to visualize

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:45,650
actually what's going on it's finally

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,110
here's a better one so here's our author

00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:57,140
names this is the bylines on different

00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:58,730
stories and when I want when I want just

00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:02,320
this sort of default styling on author

00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:05,120
names I just use the author dash names

00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:07,790
design components class and then there's

00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:10,760
a modified one with a border underneath

00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:13,970
it all the names dash border you know

00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,470
don't stress too much about exactly you

00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:16,760
know what you name these things it's

00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:20,660
it's more important that you encapsulate

00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:26,300
the design than it is to name it and

00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:29,510
here's another variation of it this this

00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:32,600
isn't requires slightly different HTML

00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:39,100
syntax because it has like this sort of

00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:39,100
partner logo but next to it right

00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:48,090
bread crumbs the the great thing about

00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:50,190
implementing this the this automated

00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:53,369
generated style guide as you build the

00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:55,740
site is it really helps you to focus on

00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:58,550
what am I actually building have I

00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:02,070
really encapsulated this component well

00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:04,290
it makes it much easier to to create

00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:06,630
components if you've got an automated

00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:08,820
alagai that just runs as you're building

00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:11,609
stuff but it's also really useful like

00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,990
this after the fact to sort of like oh

00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:14,550
let's see what's going on here because

00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:17,780
one of the things that I've discovered

00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:23,210
when I did this was we had a SAS

00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:25,950
variable called was it it was like I

00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:27,960
think of the name was like purple or

00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:31,980
something like that and the actual color

00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:36,359
was green and I didn't know that until I

00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:38,100
did the out of it in style guide anyway

00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:40,140
I if anybody has specific questions

00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:45,150
about how to do this I'm around the next

00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:52,340
few days and again that was node KSS to

00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:52,340
do this and let's go back to slides now

00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:59,330
actually that's it thank

00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:11,440
um if you have questions there's a

00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:13,299
microphone somewhere is it right in the

00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,309
middle can people walk over there I

00:40:13,299 --> 00:40:18,640
can't really see from this angle yeah

00:40:15,309 --> 00:40:22,210
okay you can good hi John um so you go

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:24,009
morning I'm glad you didn't put any

00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:25,450
dirty pictures in your solicitation so I

00:40:24,009 --> 00:40:26,859
don't have to count on my next session

00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:28,930
part that actually not the question

00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:32,289
you're showing this style god is that a

00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:37,690
thing we should get into jubilate oh

00:40:32,289 --> 00:40:39,609
yeah so the the classes the naming of

00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:42,039
this stuff that I mentioned in smack

00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:44,979
said we do have some documentation that

00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:47,769
really describes in detail exactly how

00:40:44,979 --> 00:40:48,789
this stuff works and it was it was a

00:40:47,769 --> 00:40:50,529
group effort a whole bunch of people

00:40:48,789 --> 00:40:53,979
worked on it within the mobile

00:40:50,529 --> 00:40:55,299
initiative for Drupal 8 and I don't

00:40:53,979 --> 00:40:59,829
remember the URL but it's in the

00:40:55,299 --> 00:41:03,640
documentation it find it somewhere I can

00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:06,069
tweet about it later I guess thanks guys

00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:09,880
I forgot my picture of you in one of the

00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:11,049
slides actly ah innocent in two hours

00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,989
there's going to be a very good picture

00:41:11,049 --> 00:41:19,119
of John all been paying his way through

00:41:13,989 --> 00:41:24,999
Jubal oh are you doing this to make me

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:27,069
pull it up now let's see here and here

00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:30,430
we go this is from the the fugly

00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:32,979
selector hack this is just for you born

00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:35,920
right so this is one thing that I forgot

00:41:32,979 --> 00:41:37,900
to mention is that when you're when

00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,579
you're using Drupal sometimes it's

00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,779
really hard to put classes exactly where

00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:43,119
you want them you may have notice this

00:41:40,779 --> 00:41:47,499
problem right so I came up with the

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:53,680
fugly selector hack obligatory Morton

00:41:47,499 --> 00:42:02,200
reference and basically the the hack is

00:41:53,680 --> 00:42:05,410
a way to so yeah right so sometimes

00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:07,299
there's a specific CSS selector that's

00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:09,130
really ugly that I have to use because

00:42:07,299 --> 00:42:10,779
Drupal right and I can't change the

00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:12,729
classes that I want to use so like I

00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:14,349
have to do feature intro title and then

00:42:12,729 --> 00:42:16,479
a because I can't figure out how to

00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:17,260
insert a class into the link because

00:42:16,479 --> 00:42:20,500
it's like some red

00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:25,140
array inside this thing in the right so

00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:28,660
instead i will just i'll use the fugly

00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:31,000
selector but then i will extend the

00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:33,040
beautiful sort of lovely design

00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,960
component class that i wish i could use

00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:42,220
right and for some reason this works

00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:43,930
really well because you've been thinking

00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,940
about all these design components as

00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:47,860
being independent it doesn't matter that

00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:51,460
I accidentally increase the specificity

00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:54,160
of this particular selector because it's

00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:56,230
still very independent right no one

00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,180
else's is going to use that same

00:42:56,230 --> 00:43:00,300
selector you're not going to have any

00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:03,370
design component collisions going on

00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:05,230
this is a great great technique when you

00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:08,220
can't get into Drupal's internals to

00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:16,870
change the class that you really need so

00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:20,340
just for you mine thank you I was a

00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:24,250
curious if you had any opinions on

00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:27,010
grouping classes within your CSS or

00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:29,520
within your your markup your HTML or

00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:32,260
template or whatever I was reading a

00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,450
Harry Roberts is like grouping them with

00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:36,580
brackets around so you have like a

00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:39,010
series of bem classes and you actually

00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:43,270
put like class equals and then brackets

00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:46,960
around related sets of classes just

00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:48,220
curious if you if you think about how

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,150
you group them together for like

00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:58,540
readability and find ability or any

00:43:52,150 --> 00:44:01,330
thoughts on that um well I haven't

00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:03,040
thought about it yeah yeah I haven't

00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:05,950
thought about that before at all so you

00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,440
really caught me off guard but that the

00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:10,270
ideas behind design components are sort

00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,830
of independent of the actual selector

00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:15,970
use as we discovered with the fugly

00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:18,670
selector right so yeah as long as you

00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:20,440
can work out a way if you don't use the

00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:22,090
BEM syntax which is that double dash

00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:25,390
double underscore and use some other

00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:26,789
syntax find a naming convention that

00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:31,469
works for you and stick with

00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:32,939
it right I highly recommend the BEM

00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:34,650
syntax double dash double underscore

00:44:32,939 --> 00:44:38,189
because it's easy straightforward it

00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:43,529
looks ugly at first but it's really

00:44:38,189 --> 00:44:45,869
useful how do you draw the line between

00:44:43,529 --> 00:44:50,069
what's a layout and what's a component

00:44:45,869 --> 00:44:52,709
right so so layouts really are about

00:44:50,069 --> 00:44:55,559
like big chunks of the page right now

00:44:52,709 --> 00:44:58,439
with any component you may have like be

00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:00,900
moving stuff around a little bit and

00:44:58,439 --> 00:45:03,299
it's fine to have a little bit of layout

00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:05,160
within your component like relative

00:45:03,299 --> 00:45:10,829
positioning or maybe even absolute

00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:12,929
positioning but basically it's all

00:45:10,829 --> 00:45:14,519
relative to the other sort of loose

00:45:12,929 --> 00:45:16,469
collection of other HTML elements that

00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:19,019
are inside your design component right

00:45:16,469 --> 00:45:20,789
so a little bit of layout inside there

00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:23,309
is fine but it's not about page layout

00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:27,089
removing big chunks of the page and and

00:45:23,309 --> 00:45:28,410
basically if there's layout inside that

00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:30,660
design component a little bit of layout

00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:33,209
within that design component you should

00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:36,509
be needing that same layout every time

00:45:33,209 --> 00:45:38,039
you use that design component and let's

00:45:36,509 --> 00:45:40,109
like you have like that you can have

00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:41,279
variations where you like tweak one of

00:45:40,109 --> 00:45:43,529
the positioning for one element right

00:45:41,279 --> 00:45:45,659
that I have that sometimes well I'll

00:45:43,529 --> 00:45:48,749
make a modifier that that tweaks the lay

00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:51,269
out a little bit but you you went to

00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:53,459
have say the page as a component and

00:45:51,269 --> 00:45:58,439
that just has the page layout in it or

00:45:53,459 --> 00:46:00,029
the header as a component yeah man I

00:45:58,439 --> 00:46:01,499
guess you could think about the page as

00:46:00,029 --> 00:46:07,289
a component and then all the layouts are

00:46:01,499 --> 00:46:10,739
just part of that but yeah and and why

00:46:07,289 --> 00:46:12,179
not use directories within sub

00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:14,429
directories within components in order

00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:18,049
to sort of chunk up the long list of

00:46:14,429 --> 00:46:20,699
files is there a reason for that um so I

00:46:18,049 --> 00:46:22,469
so if you start doing sub directories

00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:26,189
inside your components to like group

00:46:22,469 --> 00:46:28,079
them logically together you you lose the

00:46:26,189 --> 00:46:30,119
findability a little bit because you're

00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,949
like somebody's new comes into project

00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:33,989
they're like okay I just inspected the

00:46:31,949 --> 00:46:36,089
Dom I find that names I'm looking for

00:46:33,989 --> 00:46:38,279
that file and now I have to look in like

00:46:36,089 --> 00:46:39,340
seven or eight different sub folders in

00:46:38,279 --> 00:46:42,430
order to find that

00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:46,180
filename I mean if you have some like

00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:47,440
development tools obviously like a bunch

00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:49,120
of them you can just sort a type of name

00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,120
and it will find the file wherever it is

00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:54,280
in the system for you I'm not opposed to

00:46:52,120 --> 00:47:01,030
it but it just I don't really find it

00:46:54,280 --> 00:47:03,190
necessary so let's say we're in the

00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:04,900
middle of a website development project

00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:06,760
right now and we want to move more

00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:09,130
towards the model that you've described

00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:13,030
any suggestions on taking what we have

00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:16,120
and translating it into what you've told

00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:19,600
us about yeah so I've been on projects

00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:20,860
before where you know like it's already

00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:25,870
been done once and we're just like

00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:27,580
tweaking it you can you can transition

00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:28,870
your site if you're like halfway through

00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:31,180
to the design you don't have to throw

00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:32,440
everything away and start over it

00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,090
actually works out relatively well as

00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,730
like all the new stuff you try to use

00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:38,110
this model because they're highly

00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:40,030
independent they're also independent of

00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:42,340
all the like awful ways that you did it

00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:45,190
the first half of the project so it

00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:47,680
usually works out okay are relatively ok

00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:50,200
anyway so it's okay to do like half a

00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:52,480
site poorly and wait until you have time

00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,220
to kind of transition that into right

00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:58,960
you can come back and refactor later and

00:47:54,220 --> 00:48:01,060
it'll be you know yet yeah I mean that's

00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,740
just the reality because if you could

00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:04,000
have like unlimited time well yeah we'll

00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:05,740
just start over no that's not gonna

00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,080
happen right but it's okay it's okay to

00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:09,820
do look like switch the methodologies

00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,980
because the these are the highly

00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,270
independent so they're they're not going

00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:15,820
to have that that big of effect on the

00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:17,230
other earlier stuff it's more likely the

00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:19,630
earlier stuff is going to have effect on

00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:22,930
your late on the later stuff so you may

00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:25,870
find that there are specific rules that

00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:28,540
you have to refactor because they were

00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:30,190
they have to generic a class at the very

00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:32,410
end of the selector and they're bleeding

00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:36,130
and cross into and all your design

00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:40,080
component so you build later so one

00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:40,080
thing then I should also say is that a

00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:46,240
particular HTML element could actually

00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:49,240
have a layout class on it and a design

00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,099
component that's okay there's there's no

00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:53,589
reason why you can't have

00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:54,789
nested components as well so like you

00:48:53,589 --> 00:48:56,259
have a design on the thing in the night

00:48:54,789 --> 00:48:57,970
inside the HTML there's another

00:48:56,259 --> 00:48:59,470
component that just happens to be

00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:02,410
smaller and fits within your other

00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:04,210
larger design component that's okay

00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:07,059
we're not specifying that they have to

00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:08,259
be next to each other right we just sort

00:49:07,059 --> 00:49:12,970
of want them to be independent of each

00:49:08,259 --> 00:49:15,150
other no more questions thank you

00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:15,150
