Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: MANAGING COMPLEX PROJECTS WITH DESIGN COMPONENTS
Publication date: 2014-06-04
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: JohnAlbin
Our CSS sucks. We've been building sites for over a decade using crappy, ornamentation techniques and shoddy selectors. Our styles unintentional bleed across the site. Our stylesheets are fragile and unmaintainable and full of specificity landmines. Pandas wander alone in the wilderness.

But there's no need to drown ourselves in beer. New technologies like Web Components and new techniques like OOCSS, SMACSS and BEM show us that planning before building can make our projects maintainable, easier to debug, and smaller with reduced CSS file sizes.

This session will introduce the basic techniques for CSS layering and using design components, the heart of any front-end CSS project. We will also discuss CSS/Sass organization and tips to more easily implement these ideas.
