Tonight on the Tonight Show, Jimmy welcomes semantic content deconstruction, node.js, and musical guest high-stakes distributed application development. Here's............Drupal?

Oh yes, the blue drop made a big splash on the Tonight Show web site, but you wouldn't know it by looking at it.

The world tuned in when Jay Leno handed the Tonight Show legacy over to new host, Jimmy Fallon. Behind the scenes, away from the cameras, an entirely different transition was taking place, led by CP+B, Four Kitchens, Lullabot, and NBC Digital. A new website for the Tonight Show was being launched.

We'll share how a distributed multi-national, multi-company team of Drupal, Node.js, Backbone, and editorial experts:

Developed a semantic content model unique to the Tonight Show
Delivered a future-facing Drupal 7 backend that foreshadows key features of Drupal 8
Triumphed over tight project constraints by fully exploiting a decoupled and distributed systems architecture.
Hosts Andrew Berry (deviantintegral) from Lullabot and David Diers (thebruce) from Four Kitchens present one episode at Drupalcon Austin that you don't want to miss.
