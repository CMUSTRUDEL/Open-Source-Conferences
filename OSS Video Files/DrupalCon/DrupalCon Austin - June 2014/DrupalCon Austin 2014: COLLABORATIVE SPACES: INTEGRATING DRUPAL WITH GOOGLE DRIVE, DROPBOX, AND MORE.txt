Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: COLLABORATIVE SPACES: INTEGRATING DRUPAL WITH GOOGLE DRIVE, DROPBOX, AND MORE
Publication date: 2014-06-05
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: cmsdavebarnettech
For many people, services like Google Drive and Dropbox are becoming the go to destinations for their documents. Additionally, services like Google+ Hangouts and Google Talk serve as primary channels for realtime communication. In this session, we'll demonstrate how to create a more collaborative user experience by bridging the gap between the content that is managed in Drupal, and the documents, files, and conversations that are exchanged outside of Drupal. In doing so, we'll explore the idea that you can increase user engagement in your Drupal site by enriching it with highly collaborative tools that your users are likely already using.

In fact, there are many types of Drupal sites can can benefit from integration with these collaborative services, including social communities, intranets, and online learning platforms. APIs provided by Google, Dropbox, and other service providers open the door for many types of useful integrations with Drupal, such as:

Automatically create nodes from Google documents
Display a dynamic list of Dropbox files in a block
Enable your users to create and collaborate on a Google Document - from within Drupal
Automatically insert Webform submissions into a Google spreadsheet
Let your users interact with each other for instant feedback and live chat within Drupal's asynchronous forums or with Jabber â€” all without leaving your Drupal instance
Allow Drupal users to upload files into a shared Dropbox folder
Provide your users with a way to easily save Drupal files into their own Google Drive account
Automatically Synchronize files from Dropbox shared folders into an Organic Group
Along with the APIs, these types of integrations are made possible with Drupal contrib modules (and maybe a little PHP hacking). But the API implementations have been evolving, and getting things working can be tricky. During the session, we'll take a look at a number of approaches -- showing what's possible, what's easy, and what's hard. We'll review several use cases, including integrations with Organic Groups, and a Higher Ed portal example developed by Babson College.

All examples will be explained and demonstrated using contrib modules that are available on Drupal.org today - so you can take advantage of what you learn right away.

	00:00:00,829 --> 00:00:05,100
awesome so before we talked at the

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,480
presentation just a quick fun thing if

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,160
you do me a favor everybody's sort of on

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,830
this half of the room okay on the count

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,360
of three if you would make a sound like

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,590
you just saw something that was really

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,440
impressive and you were kind of like

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,550
this like whew like that okay like kinda

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,400
three do that for me just on this side

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,779
of the room one two or three perfect

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,090
that's awesome and on this side of the

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,769
room and the count of three I cheer like

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,090
what you just saw is amazing it's like

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:31,619
hooray

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:33,870
okay one two three now on the count of

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,370
three we're gonna do Xin the raise going

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,690
there's no rule that we can't make a

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,670
little noise in here so let's get a

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,809
little volume okay and we'll make the

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,190
people outside of the conference

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,379
although confused about what's going on

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:49,559
again okay on the count of three

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:51,629
everybody one two three so welcome to

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,610
collaborative spaces this is a session

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:58,550
on integrating drupal with Google Drive

00:00:53,610 --> 00:01:00,899
Dropbox and more my name is Dave Sawyer

00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,850
you'll find me on Twitter and on

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,379
drupal.org I'm a Solutions Architect at

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,750
a firm in Cambridge Massachusetts called

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,390
aho interactive and I'll let my

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,280
co-presenter introduce himself my name

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,950
is James Barnett and I'm a software

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,439
architect at Babson College and I also

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,820
am teaching some courses at Babson and

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,770
it's very exciting we're actually

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,439
teaching a Drupal course to some of the

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,689
undergraduates so that's pretty exciting

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:29,020
to get Drupal into the teaching

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:31,909
environment all right

00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,890
so this slides up for this presentation

00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:35,569
will be available online as we'll be

00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,740
recording of this presentation we'll

00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:41,659
also have time at the end of the session

00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:44,689
for for questions so before we get into

00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:46,819
the presentation by a show of hands how

00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:51,439
many people use Dropbox either

00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:53,090
personally or at work okay so for the

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,679
purpose of the recording of pretty much

00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:58,009
everyone in the room just raise their

00:01:54,679 --> 00:02:00,140
hand similarly by show of hands how many

00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:04,640
people use Google Drive either

00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,959
personally or at work okay me too and

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,179
again for the recording pretty much

00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:11,209
every single person in the room today

00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:13,760
just raise their hand and finally how

00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:15,650
many people use Google Talk instant

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,379
messaging and or Google+ Hangouts for

00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:21,079
video conferencing Wow

00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:25,010
again almost every single person in the

00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:26,510
room so some quick numbers these are

00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:29,480
just gathered through some quick Google

00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,940
searches but in general it's estimated

00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,959
that today about 120 million people use

00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:37,940
Google Drive and by comparison some of

00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:41,000
the numbers I found estimate that there

00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:43,280
are about 200 million Dropbox users out

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,239
there are there any Canadians in the

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,090
audience by any chance

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,090
cool population of Canada 35 million

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,120
so this gives you a sense of the scope

00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:59,110
of how many users out there are using

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,000
these massively deployed services to

00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:05,440
collaborate on documents and share files

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,230
and so the premise of the talk today is

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,240
that Drupal provides the platform it's

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,460
it's art it's not only our CMS it's it's

00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,960
the place where we create the exchange

00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,950
of information it's it's the user

00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:20,050
experience and it stores our web content

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:22,390
but cloud services like Google Drive and

00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:25,390
Dropbox store our documents and files

00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:27,720
and services like Google Talk and the

00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,250
Plus hangouts facilitate our real-time

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,740
communications and up until more

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,260
recently these three different pieces

00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,700
have been pretty much separate in other

00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,250
words you can imagine having one browser

00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,540
tab open connecting into a Drupal site

00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,750
where you might connect with others

00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,670
another browser tab open on Google Drive

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,590
or editing a document and then another

00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:50,440
window to have a chat or a video

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,090
conference so the premise is that

00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,040
there's an increasing need to bring

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,989
these platforms together to improve the

00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:01,269
user experience and increase

00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:04,030
collaboration I think these systems

00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:06,170
should all be BFS

00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,269
so we take these kind of three pieces

00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:10,400
what I'm calling the web platform the

00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:12,080
documents piece and the conversations

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,940
piece the real-time communications and

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,650
collectively I'm referring to these is

00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,350
what we're calling today collaborative

00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,209
spaces this type of concept of a

00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,550
collaborative space can apply to lots of

00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:24,590
different types of Drupal sites user

00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,720
communities online learning platforms

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:29,240
social communities intranets portals

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,880
publishing platforms etc basically any

00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,280
type of Drupal site where the users need

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:39,410
to connect and share information with

00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:43,370
each other so why why are we doing this

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:45,950
session why why is this important well

00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:48,020
number one improved collaboration

00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:50,990
between your Drupal sites users and

00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:54,520
content contributors means better

00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:58,100
engagement of those users with your site

00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:01,280
number two increased accessibility your

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,930
site's files can be synchronized to the

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,120
desktop and available across mobile

00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,620
devices all of us that raised their

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,690
hands before that use Dropbox know how

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,830
easy it is to load a file into our

00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,539
Dropbox folder and have that

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,850
synchronized everywhere instantly on our

00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:18,200
phones and our desktop computers why not

00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:20,060
in our Drupal sites as well reduced

00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,240
costs associated with infrastructure and

00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:25,400
web hosting by putting our files out on

00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,320
these cloud services that are designed

00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,419
to store massive amounts of files and to

00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,100
synchronize those files for us we don't

00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:32,870
need to put them up on our web servers

00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,600
which are really designed to be web

00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:41,570
servers not necessarily document storage

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:43,669
systems increased site performance by

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,169
moving our documents off of your little

00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:48,770
ol server and let the cloud storage

00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:50,479
services serve them and store them does

00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,280
anyone if I had a issue with their

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,080
production hosting environment where

00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,080
you're just running out of space on the

00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,200
server yeah number of people raise their

00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,300
hands so the idea is that by looking at

00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,370
the Google drive's of the world we can

00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,139
let the Drupal site be good at it what

00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:09,740
it's doing is serving up web pages and

00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:11,180
web content and let the Google drive's

00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,780
of the world be good at what they're

00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,540
doing also high availability these cloud

00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:20,620
providers Google Drive Dropbox have

00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:22,570
massive massive networks with redundancy

00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,630
reliability and backups and they're

00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:27,760
typically much much more powerful than

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:32,550
the production server of a typical

00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:35,200
Drupal site so there are numerous

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:38,470
contribu Park today that integrate with

00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,730
these services in a variety of ways as

00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,910
we always say them Drupal there's a

00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:44,500
module for that but despite the

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,930
widespread usage of these cloud services

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,760
the Drupal contributed option levels are

00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,560
a relatively low and many of the best

00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,390
practices are still being established so

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,510
what I mean by that is if you go to any

00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:57,220
any module page on drupal.org you do see

00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,780
an indication of usage the number of

00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,520
sites that are reporting usage of the

00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,600
given module and you'll see the modules

00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,330
that we're going to show today as

00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,640
examples have relatively low number so

00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,200
it is it is our impression that there's

00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,240
still quite a ways to go to bring these

00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,740
types of integrations to Drupal there

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,210
will actually be a demo later in this

00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:17,860
session today where we'll show you some

00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:19,180
some actual working examples there is

00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,520
also plenty of opportunities to get

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,140
involved because of this here's a shot

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,310
about good old fashioned issue queue we

00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:28,840
like to see so at a high level what is

00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:32,650
it like to integrate with Google Drive

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,690
with your Drupal site from a development

00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,760
perspective if you've never integrated

00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,500
with Google before they have something

00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,580
called the developer console I'm not

00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,310
going to get into too many of the

00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,440
development specifics here but basically

00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,750
you you log into this console with a

00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,700
with a Google account and you register

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,620
an application and by doing so Google

00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,840
provides you with the credentials such

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,090
as API keys etc that you need to

00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,910
integrate with your Drupal site it's

00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,440
actually really easy to do pretty

00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,360
straightforward tasks for most web

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:06,070
developers and there's great

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,680
documentation on this online so a few

00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:10,090
considerations it's easy to set up new

00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,770
projects with the with the Google

00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,500
development console there's good

00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:16,630
documentation and a tip set up and use

00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,090
it a separate test Google account and I

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,010
say this out of a mistake I made when I

00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:23,140
was first starting to play around with

00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,960
this stuff I used my actual Google

00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,199
account

00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,960
that ended up being a bad idea another

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,270
piece to keep in mind is that api's do

00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,039
change whether it's Google a large

00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:36,680
company like Google or some other small

00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:39,680
system that provides an API whenever

00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,779
you're doing development against a third

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,029
party API they of course can change that

00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:46,220
API at any time which means that your

00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:50,870
stuff through no fault of your own can

00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:52,820
break more on that later so let's talk

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:57,110
about a specific example of integrating

00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:59,450
Google Drive with Drupal this module

00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:03,140
Drupal it's actually created by James

00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:06,380
who you see here and what it does is it

00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:08,390
demonstrates usage of the Google API it

00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,930
allows you more specifically to list

00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:15,020
move create and share Google Docs all

00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,730
from inside of Drupal so the example I

00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,850
gave at the top of the talk today about

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:21,589
having different browser tabs open this

00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,060
sort of eliminates that need and allows

00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:26,330
you to interact with Google Drive

00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:29,089
again all inside the context of a Drupal

00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:32,300
site and for the designers of the world

00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:35,209
we're able to create engaging digital

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:38,540
experiences instead of a sort of a bland

00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:40,880
document view that you see on a Google

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,320
Drive interface we can create a custom

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,820
design interface and pull some of those

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,770
doc document listings into that this

00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,420
module works with organic groups and

00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:52,520
creates a number of possibilities for

00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:56,079
integrating with group workflows and

00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:58,220
it's available for Drupal 6 and Drupal 7

00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:02,450
this module will be showcased in the

00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,709
demo a little bit later in the talk it

00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,600
was developed at Babson College where

00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:07,850
James works and they've been beta

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,230
testing Drupal to service the Babson

00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,000
community by bringing document

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:17,140
collaboration to their classes and

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:19,690
social groups at the institution so

00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:22,640
lessons learned and some considerations

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,990
as I mentioned before API is - changed

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,610
and that's exactly what happened to

00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,709
James here you can elaborate on that

00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,420
Google actually changed the XML

00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:31,640
structure after the module was first

00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,170
developed in other words when the when

00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,180
the Drupal site is communicating with

00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,930
Google servers via the API and pulling

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,029
in those lists

00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,589
of documents and files Google is sending

00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:42,770
that information back in a structured

00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:44,600
way in XML format and the module is it

00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:46,220
is expecting that XML to come back in a

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,950
certain way so that it can parse it and

00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,870
use it Google changed that XML structure

00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,420
which essentially sort of breaks the

00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,920
module that has been resolved but it's

00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:58,610
sort of a lesson learned in building

00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:01,520
against a third party API the Google

00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:06,589
Docs XML return isn't meant for listing

00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:08,720
all documents on one page or our block

00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:10,550
it's really geared towards listing

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,930
folders or documents within a specific

00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:16,029
folder and again you'll see this in the

00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:18,020
demo so that's sort of a high-level

00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:20,810
thought on what it's like to integrate

00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,649
integrate with Google Drive again at a

00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,180
high level what would it be like to

00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:26,209
integrate with Dropbox similarly to

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:28,130
Google Drive there is a process of

00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:30,950
registering your application or in this

00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:33,350
case your Drupal site with Dropbox much

00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:35,330
like Google very well-documented lots of

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,220
information online that you can read for

00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,589
how to do that it's a simple process

00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:42,470
that allows you to use their API there's

00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:44,300
good documentation available and again

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,650
as before I do recommend if you're going

00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,690
to play around with this to set up a

00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:50,180
separate test Dropbox account if you can

00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,620
full access to that Dropbox account will

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,500
be needed so you might not want your

00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:58,190
personal Dropbox files exposed in a web

00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:00,170
prototype another piece of advice is to

00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,510
understand the way Dropbox calculates

00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:05,300
disk space quotas that should say

00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,890
particularly with shared folders a lot

00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,500
of you use Dropbox as we found out

00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:11,420
before and you may know that when you

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,610
have a shared folder that typically

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,279
counts against both of your allowed

00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:18,500
amount of disk space in that way so just

00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:20,300
to be aware of that as you set up shared

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,480
folders that your Drupal users can

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,760
upload content into there are two key

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,200
Drupal modules for Dropbox integration a

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,660
user-oriented integration and a

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,329
multi-purpose integration with site wide

00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,620
support I'll be commenting on those

00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:35,390
specific modules in just a couple

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,399
moments at a high level what are the

00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:39,980
benefits of doing this by leveraging

00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:42,709
Dropbox is web interface and mobile apps

00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:44,060
you can allow your users and content

00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:45,529
contributors to upload and share files

00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,030
with your drupal user so give you a very

00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:49,290
simple example let's say you're here at

00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,180
conference and you pull out your

00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,350
smartphone and you take a photo and you

00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,320
just want to make that photo now

00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,280
available in your Drupal CMS the old way

00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,160
of doing that would be to take that

00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:02,520
photo email it to yourself or to your

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,710
web producer have that person then open

00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:07,110
up a Drupal site login to the Drupal

00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:09,330
site do a file upload so that it's in

00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,880
the drupal site and after all those

00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,950
steps that file can be accessible with

00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,930
dropbox integration by using the mobile

00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,880
app on your smartphone you simply move

00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,800
that that photo that you just took with

00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,180
your phone into a Dropbox shared folder

00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,280
and you're done it's instantly

00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,200
synchronized to Drupal so it creates a

00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,510
lot of new possibilities to streamline

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,270
workflow for content contribution as

00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:31,980
well the other benefit of course is that

00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:34,590
Dropbox provides automatic

00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,780
synchronization so just by adding a file

00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,910
into a Drupal site that file can be

00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,250
automatically synchronized to all of the

00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,890
devices that are associated with that

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:48,300
showed folder lots of possibilities

00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:49,830
there one of these modules that that you

00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,140
can use to provide Dropbox integration

00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,640
is called the Dropbox integration module

00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,280
there's the project URL on the slide

00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,320
this is a user-oriented integration it

00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,300
allows users to have a send file page

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,490
where users can send a file directly to

00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,350
a Dropbox account it's a relatively

00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,600
straightforward implementation it's

00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:09,150
stable and available for Drupal 6 in

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,580
Drupal 7 and it was created by Andrew

00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:19,350
berry that senior architect it's all

00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:21,410
about the other notable module is the

00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,710
module called the Dropbox client module

00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,780
excuse me

00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:27,630
it provides a multi-purpose integration

00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:29,550
this means Dropbox folder navigation

00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:32,160
file downloads search for files and

00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,330
folders and Dropbox etc and basically

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,370
where it can be Handy's it provides

00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,960
blocks that you can easily drop into a

00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:40,830
page template and those blocks would

00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:43,230
have listings of Dropbox files it also

00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:46,050
has a concept of a site-wide Dropbox

00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:48,000
mode so the idea is that Dropbox files

00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:51,030
can be made available across the site in

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,660
that way no per group support for

00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:57,210
organic groups at this time would love

00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,650
to see that and may help to contribute

00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:00,170
to that as well that would allow

00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:02,570
individual

00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:06,260
shared folders her group in a Drupal

00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:07,910
site okay so at a high level we've kind

00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,860
of talked about why these types of

00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,389
integrations are useful and what it

00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,420
looks like just at a high level to

00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:15,680
integrate with Google Drive or Dropbox

00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:18,589
now let's talk about what are some

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,510
specific useful things you can do once

00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:23,209
you connect with these services and this

00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:25,269
is the cool stuff so one thing you can

00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:27,680
do is you can automatically create nodes

00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:28,790
for your Google Documents and depending

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,070
on your workflow or what you're trying

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,589
to do this could be a handy workflow the

00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:35,690
idea is that you create unpublished

00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:37,579
nodes that represent references

00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,010
references to Docs and Google Drive in

00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:41,690
other words by establishing this link

00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:44,540
someone goes into Google Drive crits a

00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,490
new word processing document and then

00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:49,760
Drupal will automatically create a

00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:52,190
corresponding unpublished node in the

00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:55,430
Drupal site and that might be Lisp

00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:58,370
useful for example for creating a view

00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:00,079
that automatically lists all unpublished

00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,089
nodes with a certain tag or certain

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,440
criteria and this way you sort of are

00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:06,079
bridging the gap between documents

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,230
created in Google Drive and nodes that

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,670
represent those documents in Drupal the

00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,110
files are not downloaded the nodes are

00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,779
only contained references back to the

00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,550
Google Drive documents in this case this

00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:19,010
module is in alpha status so there's

00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,120
work to be done but it's a good choice

00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:22,570
for people who are looking to create

00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,680
that type of a workflow

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,750
another thing you can do is insert

00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,699
webform submissions as new rows in a

00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,820
Google spreadsheet this one's so simple

00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:34,070
but really really useful if you ever use

00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:36,980
webform and you want to export that

00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:38,630
webform data what a lot of people do web

00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,060
form of module of course allows you to

00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:43,459
export your web form submissions in CSV

00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:46,699
format or TSB format you would then

00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:48,620
download that export a CSV file load it

00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:50,060
into Excel and you know there you're in

00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,980
a spreadsheet what this does it sort of

00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,569
bridges the gap a little bit it allows

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,180
you to essentially click export to

00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:57,800
Google Drive in a click your web form

00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,230
submissions are made available in a

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,269
Google spreadsheet from there you can

00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:05,150
create charts and graphs and analyze the

00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:07,250
submissions some really cool stuff it's

00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,689
super easy to implement it's worth

00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,990
noting that this provides a sort of

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:11,189
on-demand

00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,839
or as opposed to something that's

00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:14,030
automatically synchronized back to a

00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:18,800
spreadsheet in that way

00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:18,800
basically it saves clicks it saves steps

00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:25,800
this is at just a quick screenshot here

00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,480
you can see this is the webform screen

00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,809
where you would normally download web

00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,880
form results to Excel or a CSV file you

00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:34,740
can see it adds the additional option

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,220
there to send to Google Drive very

00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:40,020
straightforward another thing you can do

00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:43,920
allow your Drupal users to browse and

00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:45,720
upload files into a Dropbox account that

00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:49,200
can be an individual users Dropbox

00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,360
account or a site-wide Dropbox you would

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,920
use one of the Dropbox modules I

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,390
mentioned just a short while ago to

00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:59,400
accomplish that that's the Dropbox

00:17:54,390 --> 00:18:01,170
client module for triple7 another thing

00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,520
you can do not necessarily a benefit to

00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:06,559
the end user but a benefit nonetheless

00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:10,700
is to use Google Drive or Dropbox as a

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:12,780
destination for your backups really cool

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,540
many of us use the backup and migrate

00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:17,400
module to make backups really simple to

00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,290
download from our Drupal sites what this

00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:23,090
does is it extends the back of the body

00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:25,470
migrate module and allows you to specify

00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:27,870
Dropbox in this case as a backup

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,490
destination so if I wanted to do to a

00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:31,800
big backup of the site instead of

00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:33,000
downloading that to my laptop I just

00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,830
click a button it sends it into my

00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,540
Dropbox again the benefit of that is by

00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:39,179
doing that that that backup file is

00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:41,370
automatically synchronized to the other

00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:46,559
devices that I've set up with my Dropbox

00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:47,790
account another thing you can do no

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,580
Drupal module is necessarily required

00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:52,470
but it's another possibility using these

00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,840
services to actually serve images and

00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,970
media as you know with a service like

00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,490
Dropbox you can share any file which

00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:02,370
creates a public web you know URL for

00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:04,110
the file and in some cases it may be

00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:06,030
useful to let Dropbox or Google Drive

00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,309
hosts and serve specific media media

00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:10,350
files particularly if you're on a lower

00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:13,290
tier hosting account and traffic and

00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:15,000
storage quotas or bandwidth usage may be

00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:17,970
a factor for you this could be a handy

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,250
way to offload some of that just be

00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:24,409
aware of traffic limits if

00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:26,270
applicable with these services another

00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:28,580
thing you can do is extend a Content

00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:31,460
type with a document field this

00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,530
particular module G Drive sync uses a

00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,049
custom field type to connect nodes to

00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:38,419
Google Documents it's really just more

00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:40,909
of a simple way of just saying this node

00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:43,730
is associated with this Google document

00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:46,460
to provide a a synchronization in that

00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:48,250
way not again not pulling the Google

00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:51,590
Documents into Drupal as much as

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:56,809
associating Drupal pages or nodes to

00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:59,090
corresponding documents another very

00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:00,380
simple one but very handy at the top of

00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,669
the session we established that pretty

00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,190
much every single person in this rooms

00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:06,020
uses Google Drive if you have a website

00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:08,120
with files on it that users typically

00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,700
download to their computers you can use

00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,340
this module which is called save to

00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:17,330
drive that what it does is it adds a

00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:20,120
button next to the file link and allows

00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:22,010
that person in a click to save that file

00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,990
to their Google Drive in other words

00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,490
instead of clicking to download the file

00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,559
to their computer they click the safe to

00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,840
drive button and provided that they're

00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,309
logged into Google the file will

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,980
automatically be sent into the Google

00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:35,990
Drive account basically just making it a

00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,640
little bit handier for the users of your

00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,409
site that do use Google Drive and would

00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,880
prefer to put the file in their Drive

00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:47,210
rather than downloading to their

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:48,559
computer here's a screenshot kind of

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:52,159
showing a simple example of what that

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:54,830
looks like you can see the safe to drive

00:20:52,159 --> 00:21:00,080
button appearing where the file link

00:20:54,830 --> 00:21:01,490
would normally show up on a page another

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,130
thing you can do is is create an

00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:07,190
embedded document content type this

00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:08,720
particular module G darkfield adds a new

00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:11,330
formatter to the file field using the

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,909
field API this one is really awesome

00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:16,220
it displays PDF files Microsoft Word

00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:17,929
documents PowerPoint presentations or

00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,700
Excel spreadsheets directly with an

00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:21,110
intrical node in fact the author of this

00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,250
module is in the audience today I want

00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:26,500
to give them an object is over there

00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,500
thank you Jeff for this one yeah

00:21:27,389 --> 00:21:31,179
let me let me tell you this is this is

00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:33,039
actually really really handy there are

00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:35,649
many types of files that you might make

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:38,139
available in your site that aren't able

00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:40,210
to be displayed in the web browser and a

00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:42,700
good example of that is a Word document

00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:44,320
imagine you have a dot do C file and

00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,700
there's a Drupal page that links to that

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,830
file typically when we click on that

00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,990
file what happens it downloads to our

00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:51,610
computer right what this does is it

00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,980
basically leverages a service that

00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:56,980
Google provides for free that actually

00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:59,880
will render a preview of that document

00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:02,799
so formats like Excel Word PowerPoint

00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,840
PDF anything that Google Drive can can

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,610
understand and display but that would

00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,049
never be able to be seen in a web

00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,179
browser this gives you a way to allow

00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:11,679
your users to preview them click through

00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:13,899
the pages see what the page looks like

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,130
before they download it and in some

00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,299
cases sometimes we want to just take a

00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:18,279
look at a document we don't necessarily

00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:23,500
want to download the whole document this

00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:24,850
provides a way you can do that another

00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,100
thing you can do is to create a group

00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,720
files repository this is particularly

00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,909
useful for sites that leverage organic

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,740
groups with Dropbox you have the added

00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:34,210
benefit of the local backup on your

00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,440
computer of any files that go up into

00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,179
the Drupal site those files

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:43,360
automatically synchronized back to

00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:45,399
Dropbox you can use the modulo G Drive

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,779
for this it associates organic groups

00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:48,250
with Google accounts and lets group

00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:49,690
members share documents each group can

00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,309
be associated with one Google account

00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,950
and all the documents in the Google

00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:59,919
account Drive are shared with all the

00:22:53,950 --> 00:23:01,779
group members and lastly not necessarily

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,669
a technical integration but seems worthy

00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:05,919
to note in a conversation about using

00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:07,809
Google Drive on Drupal site development

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,340
is using Google Docs to document your

00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:12,159
site we certainly do this at our firm in

00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:14,019
Tahoe interactive and Cambridge Google

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,669
Docs make great collaborative documents

00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:17,320
with the ability to comment and see and

00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:18,429
work on documents in real time we

00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,860
actually use these for technical

00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:22,690
documentation for site builds there was

00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:26,470
a session on this very topic at Drupal

00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:27,760
con Prague last year so it's demo time

00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,590
and I'm going to turn things over to

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,850
James right now who's going to show you

00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,710
a little bit what this stuff looks like

00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,970
including a glimpse of

00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,500
some of the real-time communication

00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:41,049
pieces with Google Hangouts integrated

00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:42,789
to Drupal thanks Dave first I'd like the

00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:44,169
Babson team I see them in the back to

00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:45,610
raise their hands I want to give a shout

00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:47,770
out to them they did a lot of work on

00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:50,470
what you're about to see and I want to

00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:52,029
give them credit and it's been a lot of

00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,710
work and a lot of fun working with

00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:57,190
Google I love the Google universe I'm

00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:58,960
going to take the time to tell you the

00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:01,600
truth about working with the Google API

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,020
as well so I want to say up front I love

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,820
Google

00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,649
I love the tools I love all that but I'm

00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:08,020
also gonna be pointing out some of the

00:24:05,649 --> 00:24:10,390
frustrations along the way and and I

00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:12,549
definitely poke at them a little bit but

00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:14,890
how many of you have tried integrating

00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:17,710
with some of the Google Google stuff out

00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:20,919
there how many how many of you find it

00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:22,390
frustrating sometimes it is sometimes it

00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:24,909
is sometimes they change things on you

00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:26,409
and and and they're always keeping

00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:28,539
things up to data and giving you the

00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:30,669
best new stuff so it is changing all the

00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:32,500
time and it can be frustrating we're

00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:36,549
going to get into that into some detail

00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:39,220
first I'm gonna show you some of our

00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:42,700
stuff I hope it looks ok on the side

00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:44,260
there what we have here is something we

00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:48,820
have about network at Babson College as

00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:50,830
a Software Architect and we have we have

00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,679
classes as you can expect at a college

00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:56,169
and also social groups like the soccer

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,909
you know in soccer club or you know

00:24:56,169 --> 00:25:00,190
different sports teams so we have

00:24:57,909 --> 00:25:03,610
organic groups for the classes and the

00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:05,590
social groups and then for each of these

00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:08,500
classes we also have what we have here

00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:11,260
this is a chat drawer we call it a chat

00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:13,149
drawer and actually I already have it

00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:16,029
expand it a little bit you can see each

00:25:13,149 --> 00:25:17,470
of the organic groups has a drawer this

00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:19,390
is what we call it drawer it's it's just

00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:23,260
the jQuery accordion you'll notice

00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:26,110
that's been themed and you can see each

00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:31,029
of the groups has all the members listed

00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:36,250
so you know if there was it let's see if

00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:38,140
I have a real course here actually mine

00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,760
mine I finished teaching a few weeks ago

00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:42,070
so it's already scrolled off but let's

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,049
pretend this is a course a real course

00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:48,710
and these are the members of the course

00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:51,440
right and you can see this student let's

00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:53,659
pretend test 10 portal is a student and

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,799
I can see they're online they're green

00:25:53,659 --> 00:26:01,700
right and I can click here we also have

00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:08,600
a button start chat and we can just you

00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:10,999
know throw a chat over the wall first in

00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:14,749
a live demo which I hear is dangerous

00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:22,460
and this looks like it went offline so

00:26:14,749 --> 00:26:30,440
let me in case the internet is off I did

00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:31,879
record this as well but um yeah live

00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,809
demos are dangerous this is what I've

00:26:31,879 --> 00:26:37,090
heard so anyhow that does usually work

00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:41,049
it worked two minutes before of course

00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:41,049
well let me just refresh the screen

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,750
you guys can do one of those hoorays

00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,670
again right now if you want there you go

00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:57,990
what is the left-hand side of the the

00:26:53,670 --> 00:27:04,530
group saying a woo and here we say wow

00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:06,000
or something arrey okay well you know

00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:08,220
I'm gonna show I was worried about this

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,750
they had this prepared just in case the

00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:20,340
internet or something was was going

00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:22,140
funny let's show this demo this way I'm

00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,740
gonna I'm gonna talk over it you can see

00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:27,870
I've got the Princess Leia effect and

00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:30,020
you can see you can see my gray hair

00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:32,880
kind of glistens remember that 1980s

00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:35,790
cinematography I've got that is that

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,559
that's a special effect are you going to

00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:40,590
see pretty soon the chat door is going

00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:47,240
to open up and we're gonna send chats

00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:47,240
across here we open the chat drawer here

00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:00,360
you can see the different organic group

00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:04,260
so you can look inside the different

00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,730
drawers and we're gonna send a chat

00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,230
across in a second it might be faster

00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:09,450
for you just to assume it is but I

00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:11,429
suppose but we're you're also gonna see

00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:15,030
is you can start a Google hangout this

00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:16,410
way also and you can see that there are

00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:18,840
three buttons there when you open up the

00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:21,150
chat drawer and you can see one is the

00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:24,090
green button for chat one is to send an

00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:25,530
email and one is to start a Google

00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:28,770
hangout or we're calling it a Drupal

00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:32,910
hangout and it's pretty cool you're

00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:35,070
gonna see a chat go across here and of

00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:42,179
course when it's not live it worked fine

00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:44,750
I don't know if it's the internet or

00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,750
what here but

00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:55,970
you're gonna see the chats going back

00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:57,590
and forth in what's special about

00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:00,410
integrating with the Google universe is

00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:02,630
you have chat you have hangouts and it

00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:04,250
increases collisions between your

00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:06,560
communities so if you have Babson

00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,880
students and they're trying to have a

00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:11,480
class and they want to exchange ideas

00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:13,490
during a class I'm able to go into a and

00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,110
we'll start exchanging ideas in the

00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:16,850
forum we have very rich

00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:18,620
forums as you can expect in a business

00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:22,220
school and they're discussing business

00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:24,260
cases and then maybe they see some ones

00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,120
online what we have here is you see the

00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:29,240
little bubbles next to each person's

00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:32,150
username we've over written theme

00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:34,250
username so that there's a chat bubble

00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:36,170
next to each each user name and you can

00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:38,380
see for every mention of a username you

00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:41,300
can see who's online who's not and

00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:42,560
that's useful if you're reading this is

00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,380
a discussion board you're seeing right

00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:49,430
here if you see a post in the discussion

00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:50,630
board this is completely custom if you

00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,250
would see a post that you're interested

00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:54,680
in and they're online or with professors

00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:56,360
online you can see their online and send

00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,860
them a chat and say hey that's a really

00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,930
great post why don't you tell me some

00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:02,030
more about it and you've socialized your

00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:04,570
Drupal installation the other thing

00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:07,610
that's really cool is we use one

00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:09,680
installation as the core installation

00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:12,650
right so you can actually have multiple

00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,390
Drupal sites connected to the base

00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:16,940
Drupal site and you can have chats

00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:18,980
between digital sites so if you go to

00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:21,470
one of your other portals we have a

00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:24,050
student portal we have a faculty portal

00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:26,870
and so if they're on a portal and they

00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:28,700
read some new announcement they can they

00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:30,470
can still have a chat with any of our

00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,600
other Drupal sites or they can start at

00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:35,570
Google hangout with any of the other

00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:37,520
Drupal sites and that kind of

00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:39,140
collaboration is is something companies

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,510
sometimes pay for Babson at one point

00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:44,210
was talking about ripping up the roads

00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:46,130
through the through the college and

00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:48,380
setting up you know beautiful path and

00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:51,620
and seating and and they were trying to

00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:53,930
trying to not create a larger smokers

00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:55,610
lounge but create a you know a large

00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:57,200
area where people could interact and

00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,680
make me they'd sit then they talk to

00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,750
each other

00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,410
and it's a heck of a lot easier to not

00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:03,050
rip up the

00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:04,730
tarah campus but to you know to make it

00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:07,010
so that you can just chat with anybody

00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:08,900
at anytime and to have it so that hook

00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:11,650
username is replaced with this chat

00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:15,860
experience it's it's pretty powerful and

00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:19,460
I think you're gonna see at the end of

00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:24,550
this video let's see if see where it's

00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:24,550
at right now you can go into a hangout

00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:35,360
what happens is you click on let's see

00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:38,420
if I'm I'm in sync here it did short a

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,010
second ago okay so every side good if

00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,260
you click on that on that yellow button

00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:44,030
it starts a hangout it sends a chat to

00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:46,490
the other person and you'll also get an

00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:48,650
email and if you saw as I was talking

00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:51,070
you click on the chat and you're

00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:53,630
instantly in that Google hangout and

00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:56,750
that's very cool I mean everybody how

00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:58,550
many of you have used hangouts right so

00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:01,040
if you're in a Google site if in a

00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:03,590
Drupal site and any mention of hook

00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,300
username you know any any user name on

00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,070
the side if you can click on that you'll

00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,620
yellow icon or whatever color you make

00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:11,570
it it's all FEMA bull you know you're

00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:14,030
instantly in it in a Google hangout and

00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:15,560
these collisions are what you know maybe

00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:17,600
you'll have maybe it'll be a great new

00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:19,510
idea that comes out of it or maybe a new

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,010
collaboration at Babson we're creating

00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:24,200
businesses that might spur job job

00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:26,210
growth maybe more businesses will get

00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,970
created because more more ideas get

00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:31,640
exchanged and that's the kind of thing

00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:34,910
that that Google is providing to us if

00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:37,220
we can ride ride on their coattails at

00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,750
Reese had an interesting keynote he said

00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,220
you know maybe we should fear Google

00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:42,140
they're scraping all our sites and why

00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,690
do they need to go to our sites I see

00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,490
this I see that for certain sites you

00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:48,650
know for e-commerce they're scraping

00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:50,930
things and stealing traffic and Google

00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:52,490
can even sell things to themselves I can

00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:54,440
see that aspect but the other ass

00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:58,100
because they have this great universe of

00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:00,560
tools and if we ride on on that wave

00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,840
that's really exciting we can you can

00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,370
see here we're creating at Google Google

00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,430
Doc we're riding on the wave of Google

00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:08,690
Drive here this is the exciting new

00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:11,179
functionality that's coming to Google

00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:13,249
Drive at Babson

00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:15,229
we're making it so you can click on any

00:33:13,249 --> 00:33:17,119
any user name in there in the chat

00:33:15,229 --> 00:33:19,369
drawer or remember anywhere there's a

00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:23,359
chat bubble and you can invite multiple

00:33:19,369 --> 00:33:26,299
people to a document and instantly be

00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:28,549
within a presentation a Google Doc and

00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:32,419
be collaborating in that and that rich

00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:33,919
Google Drive experience and I think

00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:36,049
Google Drive is incredible I mean you

00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,179
you can see what other people are typing

00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:41,389
as they type it it's all color coded and

00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:44,450
it's just a really nice nice experience

00:33:41,389 --> 00:33:46,789
and if we can get people in our Maps and

00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:49,309
discussions we're using it was advanced

00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:51,830
discussions we have since you know

00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:53,899
really customized it to death

00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:56,659
but now anybody within our drupal

00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:58,429
discussions they can instantly be

00:33:56,659 --> 00:34:03,619
collaborating in a Google Drive document

00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:06,320
as well and it's just it's a very very

00:34:03,619 --> 00:34:09,740
powerful experience so now that you've

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:15,589
seen what I'm talking about I'll go

00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:17,029
through some of the slides here so we're

00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:19,250
talking about Google Drive Google Talk

00:34:17,029 --> 00:34:22,730
and Google Hangouts that those are

00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:24,710
current integrations another developer

00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,760
is already we don't know how to use it

00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:27,649
yet we have our own single sign-on

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,899
system but we know how to do single

00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:32,389
sign-on with Google as well so we can

00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:33,950
have a sign on through Babson and Google

00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:38,809
at the same time so nobody has to log in

00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:40,250
there's some tricks there I think it's

00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:42,500
if I could I think it's important to

00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:44,419
note too that the types of functionality

00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,950
being demonstrated today this is not

00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:48,020
being done with commercial proprietary

00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:51,789
software this is being done with open

00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:54,760
technologies open standards awesome

00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:56,779
contributed a so these are definitely

00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,549
integrations that that you can do

00:34:56,779 --> 00:35:00,440
yourself with your team depending on the

00:34:58,549 --> 00:35:02,990
extent of the functionality you're

00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:06,130
looking to do as you can see here as

00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:08,180
Dave saying Drupal has been published

00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:10,309
jabber has been published but we still

00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,730
have to publish the most recent version

00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:13,190
of jabber

00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:15,230
and I'll get into that in a little bit

00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:18,380
jabbers a little bit more complex to set

00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:21,049
up Devers the chat functionality and it

00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:22,900
requires a Punjab server and it's a

00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:25,270
little complicated to set up

00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,770
one thing we're we're playing with the

00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:29,470
idea of Babson because it is Babson that

00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:31,210
may be having an open atrium sort of

00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:32,560
model and maybe monetizing it we're - no

00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:34,630
we don't know but there certainly is

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,960
going to be some something published

00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:40,420
thirty is a version of Jabbar published

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,220
we're not quite sure where it's gonna go

00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:46,240
we think this is an exciting tool set to

00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:49,030
have Google Drive hangouts and and g'tok

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,740
integrated in every drupal site and you

00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:52,900
know connecting all your Drupal sites we

00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:55,660
think that's pretty exciting so we are

00:35:52,900 --> 00:36:00,190
documenting and publishing a lot of this

00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:01,420
stuff Drupal is here as I say the old

00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:03,250
version of Drupal originally we thought

00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,680
that every organic group every classroom

00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:08,020
would be pulling a list of documents and

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,750
this is a screenshot of a site-wide page

00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:13,600
of listing users documents the idea here

00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:16,360
is if you're using Google for business

00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,490
or Google education accounts you can

00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,170
create a pseudo user and maybe that

00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:22,480
studio user won't be a real person but

00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:26,170
it'll be like a site-wide user to store

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,030
documents within and there's also the

00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:32,650
idea that every organic group can be

00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:34,870
connected to a pseudo user so you know

00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:36,760
there's a document storage area for each

00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:40,110
organic group and Andrew Google

00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,110
currently supports that as well

00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:46,600
we've updated I recently updated Jugal

00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:48,760
to use the new API so it's using the

00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:53,140
client ID and the client secret and the

00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:55,240
OAuth stuff now I promised to tell you

00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:57,040
that I love Google but there's some

00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:01,840
caveats they really don't document

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:03,610
things super Blee and things change all

00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:07,020
the time and it was a bit of a maze to

00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:09,880
get Drupal working with the latest API

00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:12,880
they've got it in SVN they're their

00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:14,670
classes and everything to use in PHP

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,380
then if you look in the fine print

00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:19,480
somewhere it says this has been moved to

00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:21,880
github then you get to github you

00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,500
download that and then it says you know

00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,900
what the latest stuff before me want to

00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,700
use it you have to very small print I

00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:30,530
don't even know where I found it all the

00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:32,120
class names have changed slightly and so

00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:34,430
works unless you know it it changed the

00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:38,090
the class names a little bit to get your

00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:39,410
stuff that works it I love I sing Google

00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:42,380
sprays they're awesome and it's very

00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:45,170
organic and they really they really spur

00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:49,100
a lot of innovation and it's awesome but

00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:50,900
it is tough to chase chase Google and it

00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,790
has its challenges and if anybody wants

00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,080
to get involved and in helping with

00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:57,860
these modules it would be very welcome

00:37:54,080 --> 00:38:00,550
it's hard to always always be on top of

00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:05,110
all those changes

00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:09,650
so this is where jabber is published and

00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:11,300
jabber uses jabber is what what this

00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:13,550
technology this chat technology used to

00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:15,500
be called I think IBM officially has the

00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:18,590
rights to that name now and it's really

00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:20,210
cold XMPP to have have the chatting

00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:23,330
going on you know if you use ADM on a

00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:26,210
Mac or or any any chat technology it's

00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:29,870
actually XMPP protocol there's HTML and

00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:32,330
then there's XMPP you know these are not

00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:34,940
competing technologies but XMPP is the

00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:37,280
underlying language beneath and I'll

00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:39,230
show you some of the XML that XMPP uses

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,260
it's it's an XML based exchange of

00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:45,410
information and Punjab server is what

00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:47,750
mediates all the traffic when you send a

00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:49,640
message it kind of routes it all and you

00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:53,600
have to set that up with some complex

00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:55,940
DNS settings and it takes a bit to to

00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:58,850
get that set up it's it's all published

00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:02,210
online here's just some some more

00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:07,310
screenshots jabber - people chatting not

00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:09,230
during a live demo and we had some

00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:11,720
performance issues you we learned you

00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:14,150
really have to load jabber and this hang

00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,470
out stuff asynchronously using Java

00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:17,990
JavaScript I think it was the window

00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:19,310
download event that eventually we

00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:22,310
realized that dawned upon us we had to

00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:24,800
use you really just can't wait for if

00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:26,780
you if you have 50 or 75 contacts

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,250
eventually you can't wait for all that

00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:30,590
stuff to load to have your page come up

00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:33,260
we had for for a few months we were

00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:35,300
struggling with some some bad load times

00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:38,710
but we moved everything into window

00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:40,839
window download and job jQuery and there

00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:43,270
he comes up you know after the page

00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:45,750
loads in it if you look Google does the

00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:48,490
same thing they they load up their Gmail

00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:50,410
page and then you'll notice chat comes

00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:53,460
in a little bit afterwards you know it

00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:55,810
takes an extra maybe two three seconds

00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:57,970
but this is definitely a picture of how

00:39:55,810 --> 00:40:00,280
I felt many times and struggling with

00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:03,880
this stuff no joke

00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:06,400
and but it's been it's been very fun and

00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,780
interesting it's good projects I I was

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,330
joking with Dave you thought I should

00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,980
put the slide in where the sidewalk ends

00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:13,900
this is where the internet ends you know

00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,460
you go you usually go and you look at

00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:17,650
Stack Exchange and you're like thank God

00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:19,510
somebody saved me today you know I I

00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:21,730
know how to do this now when you're

00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:22,750
trying to make your own video - good

00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:23,830
luck trying to make your own video

00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:27,460
client nobody's sharing that information

00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:29,680
yet I'm sure it can be done but you got

00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:32,440
to read the original specs you got to

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,210
read you know the documentation that was

00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,869
clearly written by PhDs that don't talk

00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:39,430
to people very often and I had to do

00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:41,470
that sometimes with the jabber and it

00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:43,420
was fun and interesting but like I saw

00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:45,880
that other side of the guy with the hair

00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:48,849
out you know in every direction it's

00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,680
certainly certainly challenging so where

00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:52,450
the internet ends it does end at a

00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,570
certain point and it's kind of fun as a

00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,920
developer - to plow through that I you

00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:59,980
know we're still riding on Google's

00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,450
coattails but trying to integrate with

00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:03,730
hangouts they want you to use hangouts

00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:05,619
right now in my opinion is there aren't

00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:07,470
rich rich API is for dealing with

00:41:05,619 --> 00:41:10,950
hangouts we kind of use a workaround and

00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:15,250
trickery to get it working with with

00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:17,770
Drupal but you know some of the stuff

00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:19,510
some of the stuff the companies aren't

00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:21,910
really sharing very much yet or maybe

00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:24,550
it's just they're busy who knows but it

00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:27,550
is what it is to get it working with PHP

00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:29,730
there's this handshake between I'm going

00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:33,220
to open up for questions very soon but

00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:35,650
this there's an AR ID in an S ID a

00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:40,720
session ID and what's known as an AR ID

00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:42,520
in XMPP and you don't want to get those

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:45,160
things originally in JavaScript because

00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,480
it'll be in clear text in your

00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,310
JavaScript which is client-side and

00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,010
people can steal

00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:52,650
your your chat session so what you have

00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:55,530
to do is you have to create the s ID and

00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:59,580
our ID in PHP and then pass it over

00:41:55,530 --> 00:42:02,490
securely to the JavaScript and then the

00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:03,750
JavaScript can can pick up where the PHP

00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:06,540
left off and continue the conversation

00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:08,940
and there's some security around the r

00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:11,730
ID every time there's a new bit of

00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:13,890
information passed the r ID increases by

00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:15,660
one so it's it's literally a number like

00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:17,550
you know five thousand or something and

00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,810
then the next chat message would be five

00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:22,020
thousand and one and then five thousand

00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:24,450
two and if there's a gap of two in the r

00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:27,900
ID between messages the chat will will

00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:30,300
stop it means that it's not a secure

00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,550
session any longer for the non-technical

00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,590
people in the audience he's saying that

00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:38,010
getting this working was really hard yes

00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:40,670
I don't know who of you is technical and

00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:45,090
who is looking to download and install

00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:47,130
but it was fun to develop then strophe I

00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:49,680
should give credit is the JavaScript

00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:50,880
library that I integrated with strophe

00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,580
is the JavaScript library that

00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,400
integrates with XMPP I'm not talking a

00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:59,040
little fast causes a lot to give you the

00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,320
only definitive resource that's just

00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:05,250
really awesome about the internet for

00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:07,020
XMPP is this this guy Jack motif and he

00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,640
wrote this book professional XMPP

00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:10,800
programming with JavaScript and jQuery

00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,750
and he's great and he is highly

00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,000
available on the internet although don't

00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:17,040
tell him I said that cuz you know you'll

00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,320
all bother him but but he was really

00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,820
instrumental in helping me understand

00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,010
some of the stuff at read his book and

00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:26,280
he was he's on the Google the Google

00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:27,840
forums not answering questions so he was

00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:31,410
he was just really awesome he still is

00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:33,150
and his book was really well written

00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:36,900
it's a really complex subject and he did

00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:39,030
a good job again every every username

00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,790
has this effect where you can chat or

00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:49,700
hang out or or start the Google Drive

00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:52,020
stuff and this is what XMPP looks like

00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:55,980
you don't have to memorize your work

00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:57,810
whatever it's a bunch of XML you can see

00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:59,460
it calls a PHP function I wrote jabber

00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:01,710
get next to our ideal as I said it just

00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:06,780
increments by 1 every time something

00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:09,090
happens this is our interface that one

00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:12,060
of our developers built song road it's

00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:13,890
really awesome you click on the Google

00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:18,750
Drive oh this is actually hangouts you

00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:20,070
can see every name you add adds to this

00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,870
field here and then you can start a

00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:23,190
hangout say three people have any

00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:26,210
hangout in this case after you click

00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:29,130
start hangout they get a chat message

00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:30,390
the the sender of the of the Hangout

00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:32,760
clicks on this button they're in the

00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:35,400
hangout you saw in the demo the recorded

00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,110
demo and the other person gets a chat

00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,900
they click on the link everybody's in

00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:41,700
the demo all at once and it's pretty

00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,550
cool and that's me talking to myself

00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:46,109
because I only have one webcam and I

00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:53,279
can't manage more than that

00:44:46,109 --> 00:44:56,180
doing a screenshot so I wanted to show a

00:44:53,279 --> 00:44:58,589
couple of things this is the dull

00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,970
documentation I was talking about where

00:44:58,589 --> 00:45:04,680
you have to read the original specs of

00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:06,359
XMPP and it's very dry and here's the

00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:08,789
goo here's the Google console that Dave

00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:10,140
had mentioned I can't show you the

00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:15,119
credentials page because then you'll see

00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:16,319
my secret my Google secret but you have

00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,460
to configure some of the stuff and

00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:20,839
there's some good documentation around

00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:23,190
that this is the strophe library the

00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:26,519
JavaScript library that is integrated

00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:32,119
into jabber the jabber module this is

00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:36,029
the Jack motif stuff and again this is

00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:37,440
this is the interface here and you can

00:45:36,029 --> 00:45:41,430
see this is the dev version and we have

00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:42,630
Google Drive you can see you can name

00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:44,430
name who the owner is

00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:46,559
this is gonna be posted soon hopefully

00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:48,150
it's gonna be available so I got through

00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:50,279
a lot of stuff we're gonna open up to

00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:52,170
questions right absolutely but also the

00:45:50,279 --> 00:45:54,539
last slide of the presentation here

00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:56,880
screen so so just in closing then that

00:45:54,539 --> 00:45:59,940
the takeaway from from some of this is

00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:03,210
that all without ever leaving Drupal

00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:06,180
people can engage in chat engage in

00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:07,710
video conversation spin up a brand new

00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,660
document share it with each other

00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:12,239
and bring a lot of that collaborative

00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:13,799
experience into the the drupal interface

00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:15,150
so at this point well if you have any

00:46:13,799 --> 00:46:16,470
questions there are there's a microphone

00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:17,749
in the center of the room so that your

00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:20,489
question can be heard on the recording

00:46:17,749 --> 00:46:23,509
and for those of you who are heading out

00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:23,509
thank you so much for coming

00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:33,020
so on the Babson website did the users

00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,760
were they required to have Google

00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:36,890
accounts to log in or where they all

00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:39,560
assigned a non Mis accounts yes

00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:43,460
everybody at Babson has a Google account

00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:45,290
and we we forced it so that they're able

00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:48,650
to have conversations there's an option

00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:51,320
so that you are not private you know if

00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:54,230
you get a chat you accept that chat

00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:56,990
there's no authorization is there a way

00:46:54,230 --> 00:47:00,260
to make it like you said in the Google

00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:03,109
for education or Google Google Apps for

00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:04,910
Business you can create anonymous users

00:47:03,109 --> 00:47:06,950
or anonymous buckets whatever you call

00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:09,200
them could you do that for users as well

00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:11,900
so people could just log in their normal

00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,760
way without logging in via their Google

00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:17,270
accounts we do have the option so they

00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:22,099
can turn off chat and it's the same as

00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:23,599
being offline in gtalk and no one knows

00:47:22,099 --> 00:47:25,099
that they're ever online they have the

00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,050
option of turning it off but everybody

00:47:25,099 --> 00:47:28,849
has a Google account okay the other

00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:34,150
you're getting their email anyhow at the

00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:37,700
college so okay makes sense sure hi

00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:40,420
Google API is have some limits and it

00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:42,920
usually very easy to hit that limits so

00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:45,320
do you have any recommendations on how

00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:47,890
to is the best way to increase this

00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:50,150
limits well I mean certain things like

00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:52,839
Google Hangouts for instance I really

00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:55,760
wish there was more integration circles

00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:57,320
there's PHP is in my opinion still a

00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:02,140
second-class citizen in the Google

00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:05,510
universe they favor Python and Java and

00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:07,790
you know you can read the original specs

00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:10,070
and they have a lot of XML that you can

00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:11,599
learn to pass back and forth and in

00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:14,660
theory you could figure it out and write

00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:17,540
your own PHP library personally that's

00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:19,670
just way too frustrating I'm sorry I

00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:22,190
probably was not clear on the question I

00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:25,910
mean let's say you use the the g-dogg

00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:28,220
field module for displaying your port

00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:32,210
files or PDF documents embedded in a

00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:35,770
Google viewer and they have some limit I

00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:37,010
mean limits on requesting this API and

00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:39,860
then

00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:42,200
it sometimes it just displays the error

00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:45,320
message saying that you you hit the

00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:47,030
limit of requests to the API is a

00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,920
business account or a Google education

00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:52,130
account are you just a sound now it's

00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:53,810
just a free account I don't think that

00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:55,850
happens on the Google for business or

00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:59,920
Google education account is that has

00:48:55,850 --> 00:49:10,130
anybody seen the limit a thousand a day

00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:12,140
for what for okay yeah so this gentleman

00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:14,120
here says that for Google Maps you can

00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:16,520
only make a thousand requests a day to

00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:19,940
Google Maps I haven't have you seen it

00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:23,510
with Google Drive I've seen it with the

00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:26,900
Google viewer where you can embed your

00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:29,270
document like the word document using

00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:31,130
the Google viewer and the Google viewer

00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:33,950
doesn't render the document saying that

00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:36,050
you hit the limit daily I mean I've

00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:41,810
never seen limits in Google Drive or

00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:44,060
chat but or hangouts but the only advice

00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:47,060
I have a see if upgrading to a business

00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:49,940
account helps I don't know if anybody

00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:50,900
has advice feel free to speak out it's a

00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:52,520
really good question thank you for

00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,990
bringing it up we suspect that the

00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,460
rate-limiting is different on the page

00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:57,500
you know on the paid Google account

00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,820
Google for business as opposed to a free

00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,490
personal account book we'll look into

00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:03,170
that it's a good question thank you

00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:06,130
thank you for us having to go to the if

00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:06,130
you can go to the mic and

00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:23,690
gentlemen the audience I didn't know you

00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:25,339
were answering the question sorry yeah I

00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:26,390
couldn't wait here if you could go over

00:50:25,339 --> 00:50:29,289
to the microphone I couldn't quite hear

00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:29,289
all we're saying

00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:40,489
I was just looking it up and it looks

00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:42,829
like there's 10 million hits a day in

00:50:40,489 --> 00:50:45,259
general that's allowed API calls are

00:50:42,829 --> 00:50:48,109
allowed but a hundred per second per

00:50:45,259 --> 00:50:50,479
user so following more than a hundred

00:50:48,109 --> 00:50:55,970
per second maybe there's something in

00:50:50,479 --> 00:50:59,599
the code that extensive calls this guy

00:50:55,970 --> 00:51:05,720
behind you is really fast ten million a

00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:07,130
day is enough for a lot of people it's a

00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:10,160
great question thank you for asking and

00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:13,220
thanks for the last question you demoed

00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:16,519
the integration of the hangouts and G

00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:20,140
talk into the drupal so is there any

00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:22,819
code examples that we can look at or

00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:24,650
download or as a module or just as a

00:51:22,819 --> 00:51:27,559
fort which one do you want their Google

00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:30,979
or the chat well the integration of

00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:32,930
hangouts and G chat into Drupal dot G

00:51:30,979 --> 00:51:34,729
chat you can look at the jabber module

00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:37,789
its online and you can download the code

00:51:34,729 --> 00:51:39,440
and look you know you can at you can

00:51:37,789 --> 00:51:41,930
even sign up to help us with the module

00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,519
but yeah that's free the Hangout stuff

00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:46,130
we haven't published yet that's the

00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:50,420
jabber module on d dot oh okay thank you

00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:52,700
yeah a bit of a general question about

00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:55,489
if you're using if your site uses file

00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:57,469
entity to like add metadata to files are

00:51:55,489 --> 00:51:59,509
there any things you can do to integrate

00:51:57,469 --> 00:52:02,059
you know either Dropbox or Google Drive

00:51:59,509 --> 00:52:03,769
stuff so that you you can still use the

00:52:02,059 --> 00:52:06,259
metadata you're putting in with file

00:52:03,769 --> 00:52:08,869
entity if you're using you know embedded

00:52:06,259 --> 00:52:10,910
like G doc field or any of those those

00:52:08,869 --> 00:52:13,009
fields that is an awesome question I

00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:14,719
love the idea of using metadata and

00:52:13,009 --> 00:52:16,460
still synchronizing the files out to the

00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:17,660
provider that's not something I've tried

00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:19,940
I love the ideas that's something you

00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:21,710
know about it's something we've thought

00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:23,210
of doing we're always playing with this

00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:25,249
idea that we can have this awesome

00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:27,200
repository of all our documents at the

00:52:25,249 --> 00:52:29,450
college you know that just solves all

00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:32,479
our problems and you have metadata and

00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:35,569
then it sits up at Kaltura or Google

00:52:32,479 --> 00:52:38,809
we're kidding constantly trying to come

00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:41,450
up with this ideal solution but that's a

00:52:38,809 --> 00:52:43,969
good idea and we haven't we haven't

00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:45,769
eaten that pie on this guy just yet if

00:52:43,969 --> 00:52:47,210
you want to connect with us on Twitter

00:52:45,769 --> 00:52:48,590
be happy to continue the conversation on

00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:50,960
that now or if you're if you're

00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:52,100
a business or college is interested in

00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,300
collaborating on that kind of thing

00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:56,390
though you know be in touch

00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:58,670
thanks awesome can you talk about

00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:01,820
failing gracefully so you mentioned that

00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:03,800
API is change and things break and do

00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:06,440
you plan ahead for how you can bring

00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:08,780
things down when things no longer work

00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:11,090
properly perhaps still provide links to

00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:13,100
the original service so the people can

00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:14,930
still do their jobs it's just not on the

00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:17,540
website integrated with Drupal well we

00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:19,760
can we can turn off chat if you know

00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:22,070
there's rumors always that hangouts is

00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,990
gonna completely replace chat and we've

00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:26,540
made it so you can just turn off chat

00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:28,250
and don't just be hangouts we don't

00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:34,070
nobody really knows if T talk will live

00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:35,270
forever they keep threatening in blogs

00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:36,350
that it might not be there forever

00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:37,490
personally I don't think that's

00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:40,310
practical and let it's gonna happen

00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:42,440
because just you know everybody's got a

00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:44,420
chat client and they have G talk and I

00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:46,280
just think that would be against what

00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:48,830
Google needs which is more web traffic

00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:51,890
and more people you know using their

00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:54,560
services so you never know but failing

00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:56,600
gracefully by the way jabber is is a

00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:58,760
universal protocol that works with any

00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:01,040
federated jabber server it does not have

00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:04,490
to be G Talk it can work with Facebook

00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:06,620
it can work Facebook uses XMPP you can

00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:08,000
have a private jabber server so these

00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:10,640
are other things you can do is you can

00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,130
set up a private jabber server or or

00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:15,830
have it ready to go with another

00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:17,600
federated service I guess I was talking

00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:19,550
more about the document services so say

00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:21,620
you're using the document you know

00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:23,180
displaying folders those sorts of things

00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:24,770
if that's no longer available how do you

00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:28,730
get people my suggestion would be to

00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:30,410
have robust unit testing even on you

00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:31,610
know on the safe server and if anything

00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:34,700
changes you'll be notified immediately

00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:36,860
if you just got a scramble in this this

00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:39,080
is Google and trust me they don't they

00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:40,700
don't really send out at warnings when

00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,320
they change things yep but your question

00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:44,810
your point is well-taken you know I

00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:47,000
think with any API integration right

00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:48,560
there there are certain response code

00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,080
status codes that come back from the

00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:53,390
third-party service so in our in our

00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,680
application integration work we can make

00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:57,020
sure those are there make sure the data

00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:59,270
is returned in the in the format it was

00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:01,350
it was expected and display and

00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:02,790
appropriate as you said graceful

00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:05,150
error message in the case that the

00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:08,070
service is down for whatever reason just

00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:10,800
along those lines I was just curious um

00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:12,390
I know the best practice tends to be to

00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,210
Virgin api's and Google obviously

00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:16,980
versions there at the eyes but did and

00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:20,970
usually you build that version into your

00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:23,490
endpoint URL so did the XML changes that

00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:28,260
happened to you I'm hopping like without

00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:31,230
the the employing changing no warning I

00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:33,630
joke in my head that one day they had

00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:36,120
some some interns and they were messing

00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:38,730
around and and it was weird honestly it

00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:42,330
changed I started trying to fix it and I

00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:47,640
change back okay and it was almost like

00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:48,870
somebody said oops and then but you know

00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,280
this and I think it did change

00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:53,700
permanently at one point I had to change

00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:55,530
it and it was kind of wacky the other

00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:57,780
thing is you don't really know don't

00:55:55,530 --> 00:56:01,200
fall into this child you get the XML you

00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:03,960
get you know how Google Drive they like

00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,400
things where you have the folders and

00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:08,090
then you drill down and then you drill

00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:10,440
down again that's how you get the XML to

00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:12,180
you I wanted it so I could have the

00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,460
great Ajax experience and have it you

00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:15,930
know all the stuff loaded wants and they

00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:18,000
don't give the XML the way you want it

00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:21,660
that's the way that they're using it and

00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,530
you know again I love Google but I would

00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:25,260
have thought that you could have just

00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:30,090
had one hierarchical structure the

00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:32,490
hierarchy was was very wonky similar

00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:33,960
lines to an earlier question though the

00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:35,490
user accounts and you said you know

00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:38,270
everybody has a Google account did you

00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:40,200
were you also saying that everybody

00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:41,790
authenticates with their Google account

00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,770
or just that they're connected to their

00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:45,030
Google account does that become your

00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:46,950
Authenticator I guess is what I'm saying

00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:48,570
yeah well we authenticate we have a

00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:52,440
Babson and proprietary authentication

00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:55,430
but then we also log them in we like

00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:58,960
them into their Google Chat accounts

00:56:55,430 --> 00:57:01,960
through through that our IDs ID

00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:03,460
accomodation and that's I'm I'm thinking

00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:06,220
about the jabber module that you're

00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:08,470
talking about so am I still yeah you're

00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:10,420
describing it that's all yeah Debra what

00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:12,280
we we have their passwords okay

00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:14,200
so this really is only practical if

00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,720
you're in a business or an educational

00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:20,650
institution and you have that

00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:24,280
information and if you do have a more

00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:25,630
open system and you know your users want

00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,770
to type in their password and you

00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:28,030
encrypt it on your server if they're

00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:29,800
willing to trust you with that though

00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:31,780
you know yeah it's not as likely I

00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,760
suppose but for a business or

00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:34,359
educational account you do need their

00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:39,760
passwords

00:57:34,359 --> 00:57:42,550
thank you you mentioned that there's a

00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:44,410
way to like with Google Drive and

00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:46,650
Dropbox to integrate multiple accounts

00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:50,859
or have have like a site-wide account

00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:53,410
for all of the storage so in that case

00:57:50,859 --> 00:57:56,290
if you have a single account how do you

00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:58,690
store files do you create folder or

00:57:56,290 --> 00:58:00,160
group and this is where like groups get

00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:02,800
their space can they create subfolders

00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,390
and how does it work are you referring

00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,760
to the Dropbox integration or the Google

00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:08,320
Drive well both with probably Google

00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,700
Drive makes the most sense in this case

00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:12,130
so you're saying how do you have a

00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:14,520
site-wide account well how do you map

00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:19,060
things is there a folder on Google Drive

00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:22,359
for the group and this is what I thought

00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:24,099
made sense was we happen to have our

00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:26,950
classes corresponding to blackboard

00:58:24,099 --> 00:58:28,690
courses and so there's a unique ID

00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:31,470
associated with each blackboard course

00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:35,380
and then when we were doing this it was

00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:38,619
each folder would have a unique ID so we

00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:40,660
could figure out which one which folder

00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:41,980
to look up in this Universal account the

00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:46,480
other thing is if you look in that

00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:48,940
google the dribble-drive documentation

00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:52,119
what you do is you create an as a CCK

00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:54,849
field and you can let the user specify

00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:56,530
the name of the folder and then you so

00:58:54,849 --> 00:58:57,940
you can you can pretty much tell the

00:58:56,530 --> 00:59:02,339
system what the folder is for each

00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:02,339
organic herb can they create subfolders

00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:10,460
or yes so yes the way it would work is

00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:12,530
if that folder you inputted had

00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:15,020
documents and subfolders it would work

00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:16,670
because Google doesn't actually know the

00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:19,369
difference between a folder and a

00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:21,559
document and it they're all just markers

00:59:19,369 --> 00:59:24,470
to something to that you know to the

00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:26,690
system and the result still the second

00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:28,849
option to have a different Google Drive

00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:30,799
account or Google account for group as

00:59:28,849 --> 00:59:34,640
well or is that not the case with Google

00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:37,119
Drive with Google Drive you have you can

00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:39,980
associate a different account for each

00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:44,000
organic group not a different folder but

00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:44,809
but a different account that wasn't

00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,250
clear hmm

00:59:44,809 --> 00:59:47,750
so you would need a different client ID

00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:51,010
and a different client secret for each

00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:53,510
organic group thank you

00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:56,740
cool thank you very much very much for

00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:56,740
coming and that's all for today

01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:15,090
with them all yeah two minutes

01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,240
No

01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:49,490
well that the chats you know the caps we

01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:50,690
do store it although some people don't

01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:52,790
really want us to their only reason

01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:54,530
we're storing it is because if you are

01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:56,630
having a chat and then you go to another

01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:58,940
page you know cuz you want to talk about

01:00:56,630 --> 01:01:00,290
this other page and you want to continue

01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:02,390
the chat where you left off maybe need

01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:06,320
the chat history to follow you but it's

01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:07,400
not because we actually wanted data yeah

01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,800
the other way we could have done it it's

01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:12,200
a clue that another window open up and

01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,240
therefore it's not but that's not the

01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:15,140
way

01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:16,190
yeah if you're saying that every page

01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:19,720
refresh we have to go make the

01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:19,720
connection again minister each other

01:01:42,180 --> 01:02:03,150
