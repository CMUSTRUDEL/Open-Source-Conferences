Publication date: 2014-06-04
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014

	Speakers: helior
Drupal 8 introduces a new, yet familiar sub-system for extending and managing Drupal's default behavior: it's The Plugin System. If you've ever developed for Views or CTools than these concepts will probably already be familiar to you. The plugin architecture provides you with a common interface that allows you to easily extend and swap out functionality without having to re-implement boiler-plate code, all while keep all your logic in one place instead of scattered around info hooks and procedural callbacks.

This session is aimed at developers who are learning Drupal 8's new architecture and sub-systems. As a prerequisite, you should only need to know basic object-oriented programming.

In this session you will:

Learn how to identify where plugins exist (find opportunities to extend Drupal)
Learn how to create a module that provides a plugin for Drupal core
Know enough about Dependency Injection, Service Containers, Annotations, and PSR-0 to go a very long way
Learn how to define your own plugin type
Learn how to build a user interface to manage your own plugin-based sub-system
