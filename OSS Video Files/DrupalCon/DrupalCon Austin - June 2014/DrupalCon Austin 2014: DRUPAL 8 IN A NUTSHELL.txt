Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: kim.pepperboztek
This is a session for developers, who want to get their hands dirty in Drupal 8 site development but don't know where to start.

Drupal 8 is a radical departure from any previous releases of Drupal. Despite what you may have heard, there is no need for alarm!

In this session, we will look at a range of the most common Drupal developer tasks: how you did them in Drupal 7, and how you will now do them in Drupal 8 - with code examples!

Fortunately, if you learn the core design patterns, you can "learn once and apply everywhere."â„¢
