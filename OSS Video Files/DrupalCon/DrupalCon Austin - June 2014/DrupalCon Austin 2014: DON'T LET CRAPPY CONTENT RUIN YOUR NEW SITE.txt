Nothing is worse than delivering a sparkling new site full of promise and seeing it ruined with crappy content. The best designed sites can be wrecked with blurry imagery, TLDR* copy, and incorrect use of styles.

In this session, I'll cover factors that contribute to crappy content implementation and the steps we can take to avoid them. I will share deliverables that close the gap between site launch and maintenance.

I will cover:

Teaching clients to write for the web
Improving usability through editing
Creating flexible layouts
Creating content guidelines unique to your Drupal site's architecture
Creating guidelines for responsive sites
Tools of the trade
