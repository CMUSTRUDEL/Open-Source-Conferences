Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: DON'T LET CRAPPY CONTENT RUIN YOUR NEW SITE
Publication date: 2014-06-03
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: nicelobster
Nothing is worse than delivering a sparkling new site full of promise and seeing it ruined with crappy content. The best designed sites can be wrecked with blurry imagery, TLDR* copy, and incorrect use of styles.

In this session, I'll cover factors that contribute to crappy content implementation and the steps we can take to avoid them. I will share deliverables that close the gap between site launch and maintenance.

I will cover:

Teaching clients to write for the web
Improving usability through editing
Creating flexible layouts
Creating content guidelines unique to your Drupal site's architecture
Creating guidelines for responsive sites
Tools of the trade

okay I know everybody's still filtering

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,569
in but it's 1045 and just for the sake

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:13,019
of time I want to go ahead and get

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:15,990
started and how is the keynote I missed

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,480
it I was preparing for this so I'll have

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,340
to follow it on twitter later and so

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,529
thank you all for coming to my session

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,920
it's called don't let crappy content

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:28,080
ruin your new site and my name is nicole

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,059
arbour and i am the creative director at

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,530
chapter three and and i wanted to just

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,690
talk to you a little bit about my

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,540
background for this talk because it's

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,180
relevant to you guys for a few reasons

00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:46,950
this talk is about content and I'm a

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:50,010
designer and I would not say that I have

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,559
a writing background and but over the

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,140
last several years I've noticed that a

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,890
lot of my clients are just really having

00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:01,620
a lot of problems with content and so as

00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:04,400
we provide solutions for our clients I'm

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,840
always looking for opportunities to and

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,549
basically just find the area where we

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,930
can really add value and content seems

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,369
to be a major problem so I want to just

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,740
talk a little bit about something that

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,840
I'm passionate about which is that which

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,340
is essentially what creates an amazing

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:27,380
website and I see this as three key

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:30,720
pillars we've got beautiful design

00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:33,990
rock-solid development and meaningful

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,890
content and in our industry over the

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:40,470
last you know 10 years there is a time

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,790
when companies were you know willing to

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,420
pay for development but they weren't

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:48,360
willing to pay for design and and then

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,270
over time essentially they were they

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,640
started to see the business value in

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,470
paying for design so that's happened in

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,240
the last 20 years so companies are now

00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,460
like okay i'll pay for development I'll

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,700
pay for design but they're not willing

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,189
to pay for content and I think this is

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,310
for a few different reasons one of the

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,349
reasons is that we all know how to write

00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,790
so you know when you go to create a

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:12,930
website you always think content is

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,239
something you just kind of like

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,129
you horn in there afterwards because you

00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,719
know like anybody in the office can do

00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:20,640
it a lot of times it gets relegated to

00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,069
me be like you know the secretary and

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,689
office manager or we'll just use the

00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:26,400
same old crappy content that we already

00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:29,180
have and put it in the new site and it's

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,099
going to be it's all going to work um

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:35,780
but I think that this is like a real

00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:38,430
it's a serious problem and people are

00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,689
really really missing the boat here I

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,700
mean I work with clients all the time

00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:43,379
where you know they come to me and they

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,790
want a new website and they kind of have

00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,530
this fantasy like oh we're going to

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,599
sprinkle this like development and

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,189
design dust on everything and it's just

00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,810
going to magically be amazing in the

00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:52,919
reality sometimes I look at these sites

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,950
and I just tell them I'm like you know

00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:58,079
if you guys just edit your coffee and

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:02,900
like think about who your audiences you

00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:05,760
can actually save money and you know get

00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:11,010
kind of like me that your goal is a lot

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:15,510
easier and and there's a the main

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:17,069
problem is that businesses are like so

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,709
we use the house analogy a lot of

00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:21,449
chapter 3 so the building a website is

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,250
like building a house and so you can

00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:25,560
think of the structure of the house as

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,799
the development and maybe like the paint

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,919
in your landscaping as the design and

00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:34,620
content is in a lot of ways like I think

00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:38,069
of it as the upkeep and so the problem

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,599
is that you know we work for a lot of

00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:40,949
businesses where they come to us and

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,870
they've got like a new marketing

00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:45,000
director and that new marketing director

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,379
is going to make their stand by saying

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,299
you know what like we're going to

00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:51,299
redesign the site we're going to get a

00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:53,159
new technology we're going to get new

00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:56,970
design and it's going to be amazing and

00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:59,430
everybody gets excited and it's a sexy

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,379
thing you know it's like it boost

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,939
company morale people are excited they

00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:05,939
feel like I have something fresh and

00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:09,599
it's and it's fun but then there's like

00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:11,129
this ongoing maintenance issue and the

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,870
maintenance is like the plumbing it's

00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:15,000
like oh I got to get my gutters fixed

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,849
it's like fixing your gutters is not

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,029
sexy but you know your house is going to

00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:24,029
like look like this if you don't

00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:26,340
continually nurture it and repaint it

00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:27,870
and buy new furniture

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,800
the couch where's out or whatever you

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:34,889
know add new landscaping and so you know

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,780
there's just businesses are really there

00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:41,729
diminishing this initial investment like

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:43,500
there's a monetary problem here or like

00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:44,910
I mean they'll spend like 60 grand on a

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,760
website and then the content they'll

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:50,580
just be like yeah whatever so it's a

00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,130
real lost opportunity and I see the

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,870
solution as three things and I want to

00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,610
you really use this talk I wanted to

00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,320
share with you guys that we don't have

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,590
all the solutions and the solutions are

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,860
sort of like there there there in three

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:08,310
different areas and those areas are

00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:13,860
resourcing education and planning um and

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:17,280
I actually believe that there's there's

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,700
like a gap there in the biggest gap is

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:25,490
like and in the resourcing issue and

00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:29,250
part of this is because people massively

00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:33,120
underestimate how much time and energy

00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:37,620
and knowledge it takes to do really good

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,720
content so I've been doing um drupal for

00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,880
like 10 years now and I do it in a

00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,580
design and strategy capacity and when I

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,070
first started in this industry I had

00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,830
this nagging suspicion like like I never

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,810
knew enough you know like I would go to

00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:57,180
work and I used to always hear words

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:59,130
like you know marketing and like SEO and

00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,710
design and development and like there's

00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:04,289
just this really super long list of

00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,660
skills that I always felt like like they

00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:09,900
fell on me like I had to understand all

00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:13,470
of them and then this is the list it's

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:15,300
like you know to really run a website

00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,190
you have to be a writer you have to be a

00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,200
designer you have to understand you x

00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,700
you have to know a little bit about SEO

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,740
and you have to understand like how to

00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,820
add them in your drupal site and you

00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,160
have to know how to look at google

00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,770
analytics and say ok this page on our

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,630
site is getting the most traffic like

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,010
that kind of says something about our

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,260
users you know what do we do with that

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,880
information you have to understand how

00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,080
to leverage the web to me

00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,970
your digital strategy for your business

00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,440
or your organization and you have to

00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,300
understand a little bit about marketing

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,500
and social media you know it's like how

00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,600
are you getting people to your website

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,760
and you have to understand how the

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,010
information is organized and how to

00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,920
manage just like the ongoing maintenance

00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,900
of your website and it helps to know a

00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,910
little bit of code to I mean it's like I

00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,280
don't call myself I'm not a developer

00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,770
but it's like I have to know a certain

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,010
amount of HTML just to be in this space

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,750
and this list like so I've been doing

00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,100
this for 10 years now in just last year

00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:11,040
I would say I got to the point where I

00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,960
felt like I knew enough it was after I

00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,570
went to like some SEO conferences I've

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,920
been to like some future of future

00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:20,270
insights conference and I was finally

00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:24,900
like okay I feel like I've gained this

00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:26,460
broad enough knowledge to you know think

00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:30,000
about the content and just think about

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:32,040
how websites you know foster businesses

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,510
and how they support a business but the

00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,510
biggest problem in our industry right

00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:39,630
now is that people who get tasked with

00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:42,150
maintaining a site usually fall into two

00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:44,400
categories so one of them will have a

00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,990
skill set that looks like this where you

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,850
know how to admin Drupal you probably

00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,440
know how to look at Google Analytics you

00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,540
probably have some p.m. skills and you

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,920
have some HTML chops and this person is

00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:57,180
generally called a webmaster now I was

00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,980
just talking to one of my clients who

00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,270
essentially has this title last week and

00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,700
I was kind of sharing with him that I

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:04,860
was going to give this talk and he's

00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,470
like yeah people like asked me to fix

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,230
the printer and they think that I'm just

00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:12,030
like this you know this this tech monkee

00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,990
that just is like you know do this

00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:17,160
webmaster it's like that title is

00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,380
problematic and it's problematic from a

00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,280
political standpoint because a lot of

00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,710
you in this room would probably

00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,570
witnessed this where like if somebody

00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,210
has that title its kind of it it's it's

00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:29,880
not a very glorious title it's it sucks

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,710
it's like that person for instance if

00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,500
that person with the title of webmaster

00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:36,990
goes to a c-level decision maker and

00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,060
says hey sea level decision maker like

00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,340
we might need to rethink the content

00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,500
because you know the the analytics say

00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,150
this and whatever and like I see this

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,500
all the time we're because of that title

00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:49,210
people don't take that person serious

00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,570
and that person is on the ground like

00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:55,060
they know a lot but it's a little bit of

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,950
a yeah I mean it's like a political

00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,570
issue and it's a title issue and then

00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,370
like the on the other spectrum of this

00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,110
are people that have these skill sets

00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:05,010
and so maybe you're a writer your

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:08,320
marketer you might have like some actual

00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:10,590
background in in doing marketing and

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,470
maybe it's not even related to the web

00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:17,110
and the problem I see most often with

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,000
these folks is that they stay I'm not

00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:24,010
technical and they wear that like a

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,980
badge of honor those people are going to

00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:30,310
lose their jobs eventually like that is

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:35,260
not a good thing in today's digital

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:37,360
economy you know those people have to

00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:42,100
become technical you have to reach out

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:45,700
and like embrace this cross-disciplinary

00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:49,390
skill set that is totally necessary for

00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:52,320
us to truly make great websites and so I

00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:54,610
believe that content needs a champion I

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,720
was trying to find like a better graphic

00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,010
than this by the way I was trying to

00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,230
come up with something that really said

00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:04,780
champion but this is what you guys get

00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:08,230
I'm sorry I think the underlying quality

00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:13,630
in this individual who does this

00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:15,550
position is curiosity so in our industry

00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,930
anybody who claims to be an expert has

00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:20,620
just been doing it like a year longer

00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:22,210
than somebody else we're in an industry

00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,160
where it changes every year and we're

00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:26,830
always you know like growing and

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:31,930
striving and so that quality of being

00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:35,170
curious is like fundamental to figuring

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:36,820
out how to make a website work for your

00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:40,270
business in your organization and you

00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:42,310
basically have to say okay I don't know

00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,740
anything about SEO but like I'm willing

00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,720
to read a blog about it or learn about

00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:50,470
it and then figure out what to do with

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:54,780
that information um because if you don't

00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:57,880
like you're really you're not

00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,340
appreciating the fact that the web is

00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,230
just this like

00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,000
it's this it's all these things are

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,370
crossing you know it's not just one

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,990
skill set and it's in it's tough because

00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,460
it's like it takes a long time to learn

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,250
all this stuff but at least if you have

00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,440
that willingness like that gets you most

00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,180
of the way you know whenever like we go

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,440
to hire folks at chapter three we're

00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,330
always like you know just that

00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:23,070
willingness to learn is like almost all

00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:25,590
it takes anywho so I feel like we need a

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:28,080
new position and I don't know what it's

00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:30,780
called we have the we have something

00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:33,150
called content strategy we have things

00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:36,030
called you know marketers we have things

00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:39,570
called you know developers and stuff but

00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:41,280
I don't this is I'm putting this out

00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:44,940
there as a question I feel like there

00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,770
needs to be like a content director but

00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,630
even that kind of fails to truly

00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,490
encapsulate like what this person does

00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,980
like I'm actually doing this job at

00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:56,160
chapter 3 for our website like I am the

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,840
chapter 3 website champion and I don't

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,790
do everything on it I it's more like I

00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,040
orchestrated you know I like I make sure

00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:04,290
that my design team you know they're

00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,610
they're helping do the design I reach

00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,200
out to other people to help me with

00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,850
content and I'm always reaching out to

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,770
everyone in the office but it's like I

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:15,950
say this is my website and whoever does

00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:18,300
get with if we come up with this like

00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:21,900
fantasy position this person should get

00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,940
paid a lot of money because it's it's an

00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,250
important position you know it's like I

00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:30,360
see businesses all the time it's like

00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:32,040
that webmaster or that like marketing

00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,510
coordinator it's like those guys aren't

00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,130
you know getting paid as much and

00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:38,190
they're probably like the heart and soul

00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:40,530
of the website which increasingly is the

00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,780
heart and soul of your business you know

00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:45,660
that's not like a website is no longer

00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:47,340
like a nice to have I mean more and more

00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,140
businesses it's like the web is the

00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,540
first in the foremost place that people

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,870
come to you they don't even ever meet

00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:58,800
you in person they don't you know like

00:12:53,870 --> 00:13:01,500
that that's it so some ideas i have

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,260
about solving this are you know because

00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,580
they're that's my fantasy so i put it

00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,250
out to all of you guys if you have ideas

00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:11,329
or really great titles that we can like

00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:13,699
invent a new title um

00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:15,499
but in the meantime there are ways that

00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:18,970
we can make improvements so whether you

00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:21,799
guys are working on the agency level

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:24,170
advising other people or maybe you help

00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:25,999
an in-house team one thing I've learned

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,879
from redesigning the chapter 3 website

00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:32,209
is that we just invested in in-house

00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:35,029
talent so for instance one of our

00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:38,540
project managers used to write for ski

00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:40,579
magazine and I was like can you help me

00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:44,360
edit this because I make I'm like not a

00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:46,100
great writer I make typos but the one

00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,449
thing is I write really briefly like I

00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,249
was a terrible writer in high school

00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:51,339
that person that like triple space

00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:53,569
everything and put margins in and like

00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:57,889
which is perfect for the web because

00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:59,749
nobody reads um so so we invested in

00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:01,670
some of our own in a house talent and I

00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:03,439
and I can say that that's like a

00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,360
positive thing I've tried to hire

00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:07,540
outside writers and sometimes I run into

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,839
the issue where they don't understand

00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:16,279
they don't understand the knowledge like

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,989
like our Drupal well enough um so

00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:19,639
getting people who are actually on the

00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:26,379
ground to help but the content is really

00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:29,809
beneficial um another thing is just like

00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:32,389
making sure those folks at ground and

00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:34,249
can continue to help you so the next

00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:35,749
thing I want to talk about is education

00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:39,169
and this is probably like the meat of

00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:40,459
this talk and I'm going to share with

00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:44,720
you stuff that you're going to be able

00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:48,439
to take away and use immediately and you

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,329
know again feel free to I wrote a blog

00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:51,410
about this and so I'll show you that a

00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:53,720
little bit later and you guys can

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,129
reference that and use it so I want to

00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:00,889
start a little bit about just talking

00:14:55,129 --> 00:15:03,980
about what content is so content is your

00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:07,220
navigation it's the number of your

00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:09,439
navigation items it's the depth of your

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:12,799
navigation and it's the length of your

00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:15,559
titles it's also the copy on your

00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,590
website but it's not just the copy it's

00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:19,440
the tone

00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:24,270
it's the formatting or lack thereof in

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:27,300
this example um it's the length um it's

00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:31,170
your images the quality of those images

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:32,970
the consistency of those images and the

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,530
size of those images from a speed

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,750
standpoint when a user comes to your

00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:40,260
site and your site either loads fast or

00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:43,350
slow it's also the graphics on your

00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:49,830
website the quality of those graphics

00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:52,170
the consistency and the iconography it's

00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:54,510
also the taxonomy and again it's the

00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:58,290
length of the terms the quality of the

00:15:54,510 --> 00:16:01,410
terms the quantity of the terms and it's

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:03,810
your videos and again the quality of the

00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:06,500
videos the length and the relevance and

00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:09,570
when all of these things come together

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,430
they affect two key things on your site

00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:14,640
they affect the usability of your site

00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:16,890
and they affect the speed so all of

00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:20,220
these things matter and they all

00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:23,460
interconnect so when we ask ourselves

00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:25,020
what is crappy content it's really just

00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:27,600
three things it's something that's not

00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:30,270
curated for the web it's something that

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,420
decreases usability and it's something

00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:35,100
that doesn't meet your site goals so I

00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,210
want to talk a little bit about writing

00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,880
for the web and there's a lot of

00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:41,010
information out there on this but and I

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,930
helped a client California College of

00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:44,670
the Arts this last year with some of

00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:46,770
their content and I wrote a blog after

00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,780
working with them and a lot of this is

00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,070
captured there so if you guys you know

00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:55,140
don't want to take notes you can just go

00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:57,480
to that URL afterwards um so the first

00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,940
thing I created a guideline for this

00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,500
this college and this is some of the

00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,610
things I put in there so we asked

00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,640
ourselves like why would you write

00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:07,470
differently for the web the number one

00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,240
reason is that people read slower on

00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:13,020
screens so they read twenty percent

00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,640
slower and their task focused so when

00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,800
you read a book or a newspaper you're

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,240
looking for an immersive experience but

00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,190
when you're on the web you're scanning

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,670
your task focused your skip you're

00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:25,299
skipping around and people consume

00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:27,999
content and what

00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:30,159
an F shaped pattern on the web which

00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:32,470
means that if you look at a website

00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:34,929
they're going to focus more at the top

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:37,210
and more on the left-hand side of the

00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:39,909
screen so as they kind of go down they

00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:41,619
actually they've shown these are heat

00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:43,570
maps of people that are tracking

00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:45,489
people's eye movements as you go down

00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,629
the page they're actually going less and

00:17:45,489 --> 00:17:47,919
less to the right and they're just

00:17:46,629 --> 00:17:51,220
scanning like the beginning of

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,809
paragraphs so if we accept that this is

00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,639
the common behavior then the question

00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:57,090
becomes well how do we change our

00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:59,859
content to adapt to this fact and

00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:04,149
there's some really easy things so the

00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:06,369
first one is that it helps to have some

00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:08,830
intro text that's a little bit larger so

00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:10,299
this is an example from Berkeley where

00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:13,330
they have a title at the top and then

00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:15,190
they have that italic paragraph is kind

00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,960
of in my style guide I'll call that like

00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,999
p dot big or something of that sort

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,590
where it's it's kind of like an intro

00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:23,049
paragraph that you might see in a news

00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:25,749
article that's slightly larger and the

00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:27,940
purpose of that is that it draws the

00:18:25,749 --> 00:18:29,859
reader in and allows you to focus on

00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,539
that and then if you find that that

00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,739
content has something you know that

00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:35,919
you're interested in you can then go

00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:38,499
further down the page a second thing is

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,619
just breaking up your content with

00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:43,989
headers and this is pretty intuitive and

00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:48,279
pretty obvious but a lot of times folks

00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:50,320
don't do this um and the third one is

00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:52,269
just understanding the fact that people

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,559
since their eyes are mostly on the left

00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:57,009
hand side of the screen what does that

00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:58,629
mean for the actual words well what are

00:18:57,009 --> 00:19:01,600
those first two words going to be are

00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:03,820
they going to be some like passive intro

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,429
welcome to blah blah blah it's like

00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:09,070
nobody cares get to the point within

00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:11,289
like the first two words of your headers

00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:14,259
and make those first two words as

00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:15,999
descriptive as possible because you're

00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:21,639
maximizing the effectiveness of your

00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:23,590
communication that way this is that

00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:26,889
called the inverse pyramid and this is

00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:28,989
from journalism and this also segues

00:19:26,889 --> 00:19:30,609
nicely into the F shape pattern in the

00:19:28,989 --> 00:19:33,759
sense that you put your most important

00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:35,440
content on top followed by supporting

00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,889
details and then finish with related

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,889
content

00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:42,580
so I want to talk a little bit about

00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:46,059
length this is something that kind of

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:48,840
comes up um I would say in general keep

00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:52,960
your information short and bite-sized

00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:54,940
but i do want to also just kind of again

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,140
this is where we get into other you know

00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:02,100
larger questions like well what about

00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:05,649
SEO so it is true that pages that have

00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:08,260
longer content have more words and

00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:12,820
therefore can to potentially rank higher

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:14,169
so that is a fact so but at the same

00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,600
time that doesn't mean that you should

00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:19,590
make your content long just for SEO

00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:23,679
purposes google has continuously been

00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:25,750
improving their ability to rank valuable

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,730
content higher regardless of lean you

00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,559
know like this is there's a lot of talk

00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:31,630
about this out there whether how how

00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:33,399
much where we are with this but

00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,140
essentially the idea is that in the long

00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,850
term Google will only ranked content

00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,529
that's really high quality regardless of

00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:42,010
length but there's still some truth

00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:43,840
today that length does affect SEO and if

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:46,240
you're ever working on creating

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:50,409
guidelines for maybe some clients or

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,029
internally you can create um you can't

00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:55,899
create some guidelines like I did this

00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:57,880
for CCA it really depends on the design

00:20:55,899 --> 00:21:00,100
itself so you have to look at the design

00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,529
and sort of ask yourself you know what

00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,750
is the font how with the font size

00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:07,539
what's the what are your column widths

00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:09,370
and so I wouldn't copy this specifically

00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:10,450
but you can use this as like a template

00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,799
if you want to give those kind of

00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:16,840
guidelines to some of your content

00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:20,559
creators so when I was working with CCA

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:22,240
I learned a ton about writing so this is

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,760
part part of why I would become like so

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,529
passionate about this and because I

00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,960
collaborated with this guy Jim Doreen

00:21:26,529 --> 00:21:32,350
and he he sent me to find all of these

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,409
great web articles that taught you how

00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:36,820
to avoid basically to write more

00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:40,600
concisely and do things like avoiding

00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:44,230
redundant phrases and this stuff to me

00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:46,539
was just like it completely blew my mind

00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:47,980
because it affected me so much to the

00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,530
point that when people would start to

00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,270
talk to

00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:52,130
and like they would use too many words

00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:54,590
to describe something I'd be like make

00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:56,240
it shorter you're like you're using too

00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:58,970
much you know just get to the point

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,040
because a lot of things and you know

00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:04,940
like end result it's like you just say

00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:06,380
result or you know advance notice you

00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,420
just say notice these things mean the

00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,700
same thing you can cut a lot of

00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:13,490
unnecessary words just by realizing that

00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,920
they're saying the same thing and and

00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,750
then writing concisely just kind of goes

00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,130
hand in hand with that so if you ever

00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,930
you know you can analyze your own

00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,520
writing on your site I guarantee you any

00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:24,560
of you that maintain websites you'll be

00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,540
able to cut a lot of content just by

00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,070
trying to look for things that can be

00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,800
pared down so for some for instance

00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:32,270
something like you know despite the fact

00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,680
that which is something we might say all

00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:36,080
the time you can just say you know even

00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:39,320
or though it can be truncated into a

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,140
smaller word or in the event that can be

00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,330
just changed too if and those small

00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:46,430
changes really add up over time because

00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:53,330
when you create shorter copy it makes

00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:55,940
your site a lot more usable another

00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:59,540
thing to consider in the content arena

00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:04,210
is a syndrome notice banner blindness so

00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:09,490
because advertising has primer primarily

00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:14,440
used the right hand rail to show ads as

00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:17,230
users we basically ignore that and so I

00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,580
went to usability conference last year

00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,990
with the Norman Nielsen group those guys

00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,030
are essentially at the forefront of

00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:25,160
usability specialist specialist in our

00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:27,890
field and the main takeaway was just

00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:31,280
like old school web design that's super

00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:33,140
simplistic like this still is king so if

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,930
you're ever trying to create calls to

00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:38,000
action on a given page and you know

00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:39,700
somebody internally is like I want to

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,680
create like this beautiful internal

00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,720
graphic you can do that and it will

00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:47,930
probably get less clicks than something

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,020
like this and because even if you make

00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:52,610
it look like your website people just

00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,050
say they won't see it as much as they'll

00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:56,300
see something that's simplistic and

00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:58,190
text-based so I've been advising my

00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,120
clients more and more just to go with a

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:03,020
minimalist approach like this

00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:10,050
and it also helps because it's like it's

00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:12,990
easier and faster to create so one of

00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:15,030
the most important things in this talk

00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:18,240
that I want to share with you is this

00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:20,370
right here is whenever you guys go to

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,860
create any content you should always ask

00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:25,500
yourself first what is the communication

00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,800
goal of a page who's my audience and

00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,270
what are the key calls to action and

00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,410
even on the most static page you're

00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:34,380
going to be able to answer these

00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:36,120
questions and for those who have

00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,520
existing websites and who aren't

00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,070
creating content from scratch i would

00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,290
add three more goals which is this is

00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:46,140
more targeted towards editing and those

00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:48,900
are what is the utilitarian function of

00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:51,930
this page can content be made shorter or

00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:54,780
more skinnable and can redundant content

00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:56,790
be eliminated because a lot of clients

00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,530
that I work with like I said they come

00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:00,870
to me with pages that are just too long

00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:03,180
and if they were to just ask themselves

00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:04,260
these three questions and look at some

00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:08,240
of their content they're going to be

00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:08,240
able to cut it down by a lot

00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:17,029
so its up last night preparing for this

00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:19,070
and I was looking at the drupalcon

00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:23,539
website and I was like oh we'll use that

00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:25,549
as an example so this is a blog that's

00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:27,649
on the homepage of the drupalcon website

00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:29,690
right now and the blog is titled

00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:33,710
drupalcon North America kicks off in

00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:36,259
austin and i would say that the goal of

00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:37,970
this blog is to showcase highlights for

00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:40,519
the upcoming conference that we're all

00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:46,460
at and the target audience is all of us

00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:49,489
as attendees and now I noticed that they

00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:51,679
succeeded in creating pretty reasonable

00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:53,989
paragraph lengths and in the content was

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,609
relevant but there was the one area that

00:25:53,989 --> 00:25:57,769
they really failed in was calls to

00:25:55,609 --> 00:26:01,070
action because remember like I said

00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:03,950
earlier the web is about achieving a

00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:06,139
task it's like I know this is really

00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:08,299
great and we're all happy to be here but

00:26:06,139 --> 00:26:10,399
at the end of the day like you know if

00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:13,340
I'm looking at this page and they talk

00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:15,080
about drivas keynote I want to go to

00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,489
that keynote and they didn't create any

00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,859
links for those things and even

00:26:16,489 --> 00:26:21,169
something as simple as a link is a call

00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:24,619
to action you know because that's how we

00:26:21,169 --> 00:26:27,169
use the web its interactive so i went

00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:29,899
ahead and i did a example of how i would

00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:33,320
make this blog better if I were writing

00:26:29,899 --> 00:26:36,289
it and you can do really really

00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:38,539
minimalist things so for instance i

00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:42,080
bolded the the text to the top that says

00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:44,210
more than 3,000 3,300 people because

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,830
that's kind of an interesting stat you

00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:47,769
know it's like that's a large number of

00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:51,710
people that are here at the conference I

00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:53,029
added links for all of the events that

00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:55,269
you know looked kind of like they could

00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:57,409
be linkable and then there was this big

00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:59,960
paragraph at the bottom that talked all

00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:01,789
about Drupal 8 which is a very exciting

00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,039
thing for us as a Drupal community but

00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:05,389
there was no actionable links so i just

00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,099
made them a bulleted list and I made

00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:09,679
them actionable link so you guys can see

00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:12,529
with just these very small changes you

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,299
can turn even something as simple as a

00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:19,759
blog into something that's more

00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:21,739
effective to meet your goals the other

00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:24,419
thing is that um this makes me super

00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:26,309
happy so I'm always

00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:28,080
reading these blogs about like the

00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:30,149
latest usability studies and essentially

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,869
it's totally okay to break grammar rules

00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:35,850
on the web because it again people just

00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:37,799
skim they don't necessarily read so you

00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:40,259
can use things like numbers instead of

00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:42,690
spelling them out paragraphs don't have

00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:44,309
to be three to five sentences and you

00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:50,239
can use sentence fragments if you're

00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:52,889
using headers and things like that so

00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:57,929
how many of you work with clients that

00:27:52,889 --> 00:28:02,669
struggle with sourcing imagery yeah same

00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:05,580
here so and again this is that thing

00:28:02,669 --> 00:28:07,859
where it's like all of you guys probably

00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:09,239
don't say I'm a photographer like I

00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:11,190
don't self-identify as a photographer

00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:12,989
and your clients probably think the same

00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:17,039
but how many of you guys have

00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:21,799
smartphones you are all photographers

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:24,869
and so when you're sourcing imagery

00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:26,580
imagery can be tricky because um it can

00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:28,019
be expensive but there's a lot of ways

00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,609
to deal with imagery and this is really

00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:32,639
helpful to share this with your clients

00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:34,139
and they can get around the expense so

00:28:32,639 --> 00:28:36,149
you can take them yourself and if

00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:38,460
anybody has a smartphone the quality of

00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:40,619
those pictures are generally great for

00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:43,169
the web you can search Creative Commons

00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:45,779
and as long as you use attribution those

00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:47,759
are also free imagery for the taking you

00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:49,739
can buy them on like a stock photography

00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,019
site or you can hire a photographer and

00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:55,139
this is basically from cheapest most

00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:58,619
expensive and for those of you who are

00:28:55,139 --> 00:29:00,330
interested these are a few stock sites

00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:02,489
and creative common sites that we use a

00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:04,499
chapter three so the third one down

00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:07,289
search at Creative Commons allows you to

00:29:04,499 --> 00:29:09,899
search flickr for various creative

00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:11,580
commons imagery which you know like i

00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:15,989
said as long as you use attribution you

00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:18,059
can use those um and I wanted to show a

00:29:15,989 --> 00:29:20,580
highlight of someone who's dealing with

00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:24,690
the the image thing in a really great

00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:28,289
way so UC Berkeley recently did a huge

00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:31,289
brand redesign and they created a huge

00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:32,489
repository of all their images and I

00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:35,629
don't know how many of you guys work

00:29:32,489 --> 00:29:37,059
with universities but like there are

00:29:35,629 --> 00:29:40,269
thousands of web

00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:42,519
and there are people who have no budget

00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:45,940
and people who have like a hundred grand

00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:47,350
to do a website but every single one of

00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:50,769
them struggle with the same problem

00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:53,529
which is that how do I get good quality

00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:54,970
images and a lot of times these people

00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:56,350
don't have time you know they've got

00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:59,110
better things to do updating their

00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:02,139
website is just like it's it's not high

00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:03,909
on their priority list so Chris knowing

00:30:02,139 --> 00:30:06,730
that this solution is out there is just

00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:09,309
good to share because it's an example of

00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:12,039
a large instance institution doing this

00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:14,080
right and so if you guys ever work with

00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:15,580
universities there's always an

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,259
opportunity to see if they have a

00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,879
solution like this or if they don't you

00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:25,840
can also recommend they start thinking

00:30:18,879 --> 00:30:28,139
about it so the last thing with with how

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,279
to deal with content starts with us as

00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:34,389
web professionals and that's in the

00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:35,559
planning development in the UX stage so

00:30:34,389 --> 00:30:37,389
some of the questions you're going to

00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:39,789
want to ask whenever you start a project

00:30:37,389 --> 00:30:43,119
and this should really direct the

00:30:39,789 --> 00:30:45,700
solutions that you deliver our what is

00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:48,399
the nature of the content and who are

00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:52,090
the content creators you know if there's

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:54,429
a team of really savvy you know like

00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:55,629
webmaster type people your solution is

00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:57,490
going to be different than if you have

00:30:55,629 --> 00:31:00,639
someone who's like very afraid of

00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:02,409
Technology you know will it will it be

00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:04,059
image-heavy who's writing and how often

00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:06,519
are they writing and all of these things

00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:09,460
should affect how you're both designing

00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:11,470
and implementing so I wanted to show

00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:14,350
something that I designed in something

00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:16,119
that kind of got in my mind messed up

00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:18,610
afterwards and then how I solved for it

00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:20,379
later so I came up with this design

00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,659
which looked pretty nice it was a way to

00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:25,720
showcase news and events on one page and

00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:28,450
we had a key image and that was to

00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:30,610
showcase a news or event and then you've

00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:34,090
got news on one side events on the other

00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:37,629
side with teasers but over time this is

00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:39,340
what it looked like and so if we ask

00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:40,929
ourselves why does it look like that

00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:43,299
there's kind of a number of reasons and

00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:47,440
some of its on the client but some of it

00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:49,059
is on on my team as well because for

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,840
instance if you look over here

00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:55,480
on I can't quite see but there's a

00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:58,499
teaser length where we gave the

00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:01,749
administrator the ability to have a

00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:04,059
curated teaser so whenever you think

00:32:01,749 --> 00:32:06,490
about there's basically attention in

00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:10,899
Drupal development between flexibility

00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:12,639
and things looking consistent and we

00:32:10,899 --> 00:32:14,889
have to walk that line every day in the

00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:16,720
solutions we provide because you know

00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:18,999
the client is going to say i want

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,039
ultimate flexibility and it's like okay

00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:23,139
that's great and then that person leaves

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,940
and somebody takes over the website they

00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:26,350
don't know you know any of the thinking

00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,730
of the website and then they like just

00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:31,450
put a whole bunch of crop up there looks

00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:32,860
terrible and then the other thing in

00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,830
this is that they just didn't even have

00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:38,799
images so I had created a default image

00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:41,049
but you know had we talked more at

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,850
length in the beginning about the true

00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:44,470
ability for them to actually source

00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:46,809
imagery and this is a resourcing issue

00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:47,950
on their side with every item and if

00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:49,600
they said you know what neat guy like

00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,740
this is just too hard I don't want to

00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,850
commit to this I would have said that's

00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:55,539
fine we can come up with a solution

00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:56,919
that's not image based so what I've been

00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:59,289
doing now is I've been honestly

00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:03,429
simplifying things so this is another

00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:06,070
decided design recently where the teaser

00:33:03,429 --> 00:33:10,649
length is truncated not even by word but

00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:15,039
by character and what that creates is a

00:33:10,649 --> 00:33:18,700
very visually consistent look and feel

00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:21,369
so it's basically impossible for the

00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:23,559
administrators to sort of disrupt the

00:33:21,369 --> 00:33:25,240
view of the this list view and so it's a

00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:30,070
lot more harmonious which makes it again

00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:32,679
a lot more usable in the end other

00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:34,659
things that we can do include creating

00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:36,309
help text in the back end so this is for

00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:42,480
anyone in the audience who is kind of on

00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:44,769
the dev side if you put the image size

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,600
aspect ratio when you upload an image

00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:48,399
it's going to make a huge difference and

00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,379
I see this get missed a lot because it

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,690
is additional development and additional

00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:55,799
work to kind of add those little helper

00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:55,799
text on every single page

00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:05,740
I keep on showing Berkeley but these

00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,940
guys have just done some really cool

00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:11,230
stuff lately that I'm really impressed

00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:12,550
with so the final thing is that like if

00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:14,530
you're trying to create a system where

00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:17,530
people really really really can't like

00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:20,290
 up their websites it's it has to be

00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:22,419
really structured so what these guys did

00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:24,760
and I totally applaud them is that this

00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:28,179
page that you're looking at here is like

00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,740
very rigid you always have that orange

00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:32,919
bar at the top you always have to have

00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:34,480
that key image it's not optional and you

00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:37,990
always have to have like the related

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,730
content on the left and these guys

00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:41,800
committed to it they said you know what

00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:43,839
like we are going to commit to having

00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,480
that imagery we're going to commit to

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,129
keeping our you know to having like the

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,349
related content and they've done they've

00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:52,330
done it and that's a sales job on our

00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:54,849
end so if we can convince the clients

00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:56,830
that it's to their benefit to have that

00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:58,540
kind of structure it's really going to

00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:00,099
help them but it's a bit of it there's

00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,440
always a bit of attention there because

00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:03,609
the client you know when they're saying

00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,440
what they want they say they want

00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:08,859
flexibility but in the end it kind of

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,550
can have some unexpected negative

00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:15,190
consequences the other thing that we can

00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:18,130
do from a planning standpoint is to give

00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:19,810
our content administrators more tools so

00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:21,310
a lot of times I see sides to get set up

00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:22,780
and you pretty much just have a WYSIWYG

00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:24,910
and that's it and there's more

00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,890
components that you can add to a site

00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:30,130
and even like a basic page construction

00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:34,480
to make it more flexible so one of these

00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:35,859
things is just using accordions and the

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,950
one thing you want to be careful about

00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:41,020
is just not to over use these but just

00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:44,040
having this ability on any given page

00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:47,080
will give a lot of it basically allows

00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,339
more opportunities to condense content

00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:53,980
so that you don't have to expand your

00:35:48,339 --> 00:35:55,869
navigation and then also styling anchor

00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,940
links so for when you guys have really

00:35:55,869 --> 00:35:59,619
long pages I see anchor links on the web

00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:01,839
all the time in the room is never styled

00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:03,550
and what that does is it creates an

00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,140
unexpected experience when you click on

00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:08,050
an anchor link and suddenly you zip down

00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:09,010
the page so having a more consistent

00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,230
design

00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:13,210
of these things better Orient's the user

00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:18,070
when they're going to page what's going

00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:20,500
to happen and one thing I've been doing

00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:22,660
a lot on my projects is trying to come

00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:25,630
up with again this is like that tension

00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:28,060
between flexibility and structure so

00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:30,400
I've been building these kind of basic

00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:32,860
pages on a lot of sites that give the

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,870
end admins a ton of layout options so

00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:37,090
all of these slices here basically allow

00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:38,740
the user to either create a two or a

00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:41,280
three column layout in each of those

00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:46,420
slices on any given page you can have

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:50,380
one some or all of these now this is a

00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:53,110
risky design because as you can expect

00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:56,380
this is extremely flexible so they could

00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:58,300
easily add things in here that can cause

00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,440
problems and so what I've started to do

00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,290
is I've started to create something

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,170
called Drupal specific editorial

00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:08,380
guidelines and what that looks like is

00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:11,530
it something very easy to create I just

00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:14,740
use a Google Doc and I cut and paste the

00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:17,550
design elements into a bulleted list and

00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:19,960
I just write down things like the

00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:23,050
recommended character count for titles

00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,780
and body copy and the image sizes and

00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:28,420
this can serve as a reference for the

00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:31,900
client on launch and also going into the

00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:35,110
future and you can design this to make

00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:36,100
it look a lot more beautiful but at the

00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,780
end of the day it's just something

00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:40,630
that's utilitarian that allows them to

00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:42,340
admin their site effectively so this

00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:45,250
approach has been really positive for us

00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:47,980
so far and I want to talk a little bit

00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:50,200
about what happens when you don't create

00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:53,770
this guidance because with responsive

00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:57,190
design image sizes are like this

00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:59,800
unwieldy unpredictable things so on this

00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:03,370
site right here when you have a go

00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:05,710
responsive their images are super

00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:07,450
pixelated because they uploaded these

00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:10,180
graphics and what they probably did was

00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:12,340
said oh this is like the complic it's

00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:13,480
300 pixels upload that and it's like

00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:17,020
well that's great but your breakpoints

00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,940
is 640 so your images look terrible at

00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:20,239
the break point when you look at them on

00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:23,389
a larger tablet

00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:25,489
um so those kinds of editorial

00:38:23,389 --> 00:38:29,989
guidelines or a new deliverable that can

00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:34,579
kind of help that and when i worked as

00:38:29,989 --> 00:38:37,729
CCA one of the things that I realized

00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:39,919
was that people learn differently like

00:38:37,729 --> 00:38:42,559
some people need to hear directions in

00:38:39,919 --> 00:38:45,169
person some people need to see something

00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:48,049
that's more designed some people you

00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:49,969
know need to talk back to say oh like

00:38:48,049 --> 00:38:51,199
like to hear themselves say what you

00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:53,899
just said to them and then that helps

00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:56,359
them learn and just accepting that fact

00:38:53,899 --> 00:39:01,159
and figuring out like okay if you have a

00:38:56,359 --> 00:39:02,629
large decentralized group of content

00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:05,029
administrators for instance which is

00:39:02,629 --> 00:39:07,759
what these guys had how do you get them

00:39:05,029 --> 00:39:10,609
all to create content that's consistent

00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:12,919
so what I did with them was I actually a

00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:15,169
lot of times I don't create really fancy

00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:17,269
deliverables but for that em that are

00:39:15,169 --> 00:39:19,759
just guidelines because it's like more

00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:21,409
tits it's not time efficient but for

00:39:19,759 --> 00:39:24,019
these guys I did it and part of it was

00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:26,479
because some people in order for them to

00:39:24,019 --> 00:39:28,369
understand the guidelines for how to

00:39:26,479 --> 00:39:30,229
write it's like the visual helped them

00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:33,139
get it and had like that oh that aha

00:39:30,229 --> 00:39:34,789
moment and so I created that for them

00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:36,679
and in addition to that I met with them

00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:39,789
in person and I literally met with all

00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:43,219
of their key content teams and that

00:39:39,789 --> 00:39:44,599
really helped them understand that you

00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:46,519
know like just first those people who

00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:52,729
need to hear it in their ears that that

00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:53,919
helped to sink in for them so the last

00:39:52,729 --> 00:39:57,199
thing has to do with how we

00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:59,749
self-identify so as I said in the

00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:02,839
beginning I do not self-identify as a

00:39:59,749 --> 00:40:05,719
writer but I find myself in these

00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:07,639
situations constantly work the content

00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:10,309
the copy is the problem and I feel

00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:14,569
compelled to solve it so this is a

00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:15,649
design that Garrett did and he came to

00:40:14,569 --> 00:40:17,599
me he said hey what do you think about

00:40:15,649 --> 00:40:20,539
this and I said you know the design

00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,519
structure looks fine but this this

00:40:20,539 --> 00:40:24,889
coffee sucks you know this is like a

00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:26,989
real problem I'm not reading this like I

00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:28,519
always say like if I stare at a page and

00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:31,609
I'm not automatically reading it then

00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:32,849
there's something wrong and so we didn't

00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:35,460
even ask the client

00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:37,739
I said listen let's just write a

00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:39,479
sentence of what we think this means and

00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:42,450
give it to them and like see what they

00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:45,539
say and so we did that and then they

00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:47,640
said oh okay that's not quite right but

00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:49,859
here let me just change it a little bit

00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:52,470
and like let's change it to this so that

00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:54,440
started the conversation and it allowed

00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:58,859
us to get to a point where it's like

00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:00,869
it's a much more effective landing page

00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:04,680
where you can actually read the copy I

00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:06,960
mean and in it so I really encourage all

00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,069
of you guys to not be afraid to do that

00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,779
you know don't be afraid to be a

00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:12,390
photographer don't be afraid to be a

00:41:09,779 --> 00:41:14,309
writer don't be afraid to you know

00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:16,289
propose a solution even if it's a little

00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:20,309
bit outside but the clients asking for

00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:27,749
because the content oftentimes is the

00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:31,799
easiest thing to fix so that kind of

00:41:27,749 --> 00:41:35,039
sums up the three things that I think we

00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:36,420
can do on a global level to help improve

00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:39,239
this problem and this is by no means

00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:41,069
like the only things we can do but I

00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:43,049
really hope this inspires you guys to

00:41:41,069 --> 00:41:45,119
kind of think about it and to talk about

00:41:43,049 --> 00:41:46,979
it because just like bringing this back

00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,569
to your agencies are into your in-house

00:41:46,979 --> 00:41:50,579
departments and sharing this information

00:41:48,569 --> 00:41:52,529
is like it's part of the education piece

00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:54,719
it can be part of the planning piece and

00:41:52,529 --> 00:41:58,739
I really think it will just help us in

00:41:54,719 --> 00:42:01,999
the end create a better internet and

00:41:58,739 --> 00:42:01,999
that's it thank you

00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:14,570
and for anybody that's got questions

00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:17,710
I've got special giveaways for question

00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:17,710
askers up here

00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:28,819
we have spice rub and eyeglass wipies

00:42:31,819 --> 00:42:37,259
the entire presentation is not on the

00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:38,969
blog but I heard that these are all

00:42:37,259 --> 00:42:42,599
going to get uploaded to YouTube in like

00:42:38,969 --> 00:42:44,279
20 minutes so and if you guys have

00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:46,679
questions because they're recording

00:42:44,279 --> 00:42:58,469
would you mind going to the microphone I

00:42:46,679 --> 00:43:00,989
know that's kind of asking a lot how do

00:42:58,469 --> 00:43:03,149
you handle it when you launch a site and

00:43:00,989 --> 00:43:04,679
then you look at it again in three

00:43:03,149 --> 00:43:07,499
months and they've completely ruined

00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:12,959
everything you did you give a talk like

00:43:07,499 --> 00:43:14,399
this it's it's the story of my life you

00:43:12,959 --> 00:43:16,709
know and that's why I become a lot more

00:43:14,399 --> 00:43:19,739
passionate about this particular topic

00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:21,539
as I just see it as like the final main

00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:25,889
thing that needs to be addressed in our

00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:26,939
industry so you talked a little bit

00:43:25,889 --> 00:43:28,019
about this in the beginning and I

00:43:26,939 --> 00:43:30,449
realize it could be a whole separate

00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:34,439
session but any quick ideas for how to

00:43:30,449 --> 00:43:41,039
make the business case for making this

00:43:34,439 --> 00:43:42,479
role I mean I don't have the exact

00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:44,579
answer to that but the only thing I can

00:43:42,479 --> 00:43:45,959
think of is that if you think about it

00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:47,849
in this way think about when you were in

00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:51,149
college and you imagine how long it took

00:43:47,849 --> 00:43:54,119
you to write a term paper now imagine

00:43:51,149 --> 00:43:57,209
that the success and or failure of your

00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:59,729
organization depends on the quality of

00:43:57,209 --> 00:44:01,979
the copy in that term paper now imagine

00:43:59,729 --> 00:44:04,859
how long that would take to write

00:44:01,979 --> 00:44:06,869
effectively that starts to paint a

00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:08,459
picture and I think everyone's head that

00:44:06,869 --> 00:44:10,829
we can all relate to as far as like the

00:44:08,459 --> 00:44:12,269
time because it's like I think that's

00:44:10,829 --> 00:44:14,249
the biggest thing is it's a it's a

00:44:12,269 --> 00:44:16,919
really time consuming task that people

00:44:14,249 --> 00:44:18,689
usually underestimate and it's like but

00:44:16,919 --> 00:44:23,909
that that starts to at least get the

00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:28,649
conversation going thanks I have a

00:44:23,909 --> 00:44:30,659
similar question if writing is so not

00:44:28,649 --> 00:44:33,689
important to the people that own these

00:44:30,659 --> 00:44:36,209
websites but they all spend a lot of

00:44:33,689 --> 00:44:36,990
time with paper and they clearly have

00:44:36,209 --> 00:44:38,580
some input into

00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:39,810
or interest in writing but they're not

00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,630
interested in writing for the web

00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:44,430
because everything they do is

00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:47,180
paper-based do you have any suggestions

00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:49,619
with a way to talk to them about that

00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:51,570
are wait are you saying like how to get

00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:53,910
them to translate their paper stuck to

00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:56,700
the web right they don't understand the

00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:58,830
difference totally that blog that I I

00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,170
linked to in the beginning which is on

00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:04,290
the chapter 3 website it's very short

00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:06,119
and it's a powerful like outline of that

00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:07,740
and you can use that as a reference to

00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:09,300
send them and the biggest thing is just

00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:11,010
those top three things that i shared

00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:14,790
which is that people are task focused

00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:16,650
they read slower and they skin instead

00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:17,970
with those three things combined with

00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:20,310
like asking yourself what are the goals

00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:22,380
of the page that's the lens by which you

00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:24,270
should look through the content to

00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:30,840
reassess how to curate it better for the

00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:32,970
web Thanks okay so you mentioned a

00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:35,100
little bit about outsourcing some of the

00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:38,640
content and you prefer to to build your

00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:40,619
team in house but if you have a short

00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,500
time frame and you don't have the

00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:46,320
resources can you give us some tips on

00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:50,070
how to find the right either freelancer

00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:52,410
or ad agency or who can help I I you

00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:55,619
know my personal experience with writers

00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:58,200
has been only like so so because I found

00:45:55,619 --> 00:46:00,660
that when I when I hired writers which

00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:05,480
you've done probably like five times and

00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:08,609
I find that the work is fine but that

00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:12,090
the work done by my internal team is

00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:13,950
just so much more on point and it's also

00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:16,650
because I work with her collaboratively

00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:18,420
we're able to make sure that the tone is

00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:19,530
right and that's the thing like her and

00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:22,230
I will just sit in a room and will

00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:25,590
literally do the do the content together

00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:27,390
so I would say if you you know as far as

00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:29,190
how to find those people you can just

00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:30,930
find them you know on linkedin or

00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:36,330
craigslist or you know through normal

00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:37,350
means of reaching out and but then you

00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:38,970
know if you want to work with them i

00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:41,160
would say that collaboration is the key

00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:44,150
thing you know and that will ensure the

00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,150
quality a little bit better

00:46:46,589 --> 00:46:52,410
I work for a non-profit and I'm in the

00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:54,569
process of creating a new website for

00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:56,249
them I have a fair amount of latitude in

00:46:54,569 --> 00:46:57,839
content creation and I have a lot of

00:46:56,249 --> 00:47:01,109
writing and editing experience myself

00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:03,210
however a big section a really important

00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:05,369
grant funded section of the website has

00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:07,680
to do with scientific information that's

00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:09,329
supposed to be presented for a lay

00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,249
audience people who are affected by the

00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:15,809
particular disease that that we address

00:47:11,249 --> 00:47:17,519
and I've been told that this educational

00:47:15,809 --> 00:47:19,380
content is being vetted by all the

00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:21,779
scientific experts and I am NOT to

00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:25,019
change anything I think this has great

00:47:21,779 --> 00:47:26,759
nightmare potential and I just like to

00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:29,880
know if you have any suggestions on how

00:47:26,759 --> 00:47:31,140
i can kind of gently help them

00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,180
understand that it's going to integrate

00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:35,190
a lot better with the website and fit

00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:36,719
their goals better if I'm allowed to

00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:38,880
have a little control over things like

00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:42,359
page length understood that so I think

00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:45,019
that's a great case for testing so when

00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:47,759
you get into those so in that instance

00:47:45,019 --> 00:47:49,469
your stakeholders are probably right in

00:47:47,759 --> 00:47:50,880
the sense that the content will need to

00:47:49,469 --> 00:47:53,400
be a lot longer than like a page that's

00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,249
marketing focused and I I deal with that

00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:58,200
too and that is a completely acceptable

00:47:56,249 --> 00:48:00,210
answer and if you're just looking for

00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,880
ways to maybe improve the usability a

00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:05,279
little bit you can do really cheap easy

00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,660
user test and get three people who you

00:48:05,279 --> 00:48:09,779
feel like represent your target audience

00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:11,969
and maybe have them read that content

00:48:09,779 --> 00:48:13,829
and find an example of a page that like

00:48:11,969 --> 00:48:16,200
on another website that you like and see

00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:18,719
if they like that better and if you can

00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,160
maybe like take that information and

00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:22,440
those findings to your stakeholders and

00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,900
say hey like this is still getting the

00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:26,369
job done but it's you know curate

00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:29,489
curated in this way can we make these

00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:31,170
changes that might give you some some

00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:33,599
data to work with to kind of help that

00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:36,509
but that's great to ask you I'm thinking

00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:38,549
about accordions and anchors as well as

00:48:36,509 --> 00:48:40,769
you just presented but doing some

00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:43,049
testing sounds like yeah and it doesn't

00:48:40,769 --> 00:48:44,640
have to be like rigorous or expensive

00:48:43,049 --> 00:48:45,509
it's literally just getting three people

00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,609
in a room and

00:48:45,509 --> 00:48:49,949
asking them a few questions like they

00:48:47,609 --> 00:48:56,279
say test early test often and grade on a

00:48:49,949 --> 00:48:58,769
curve thank you hi thanks for sharing

00:48:56,279 --> 00:49:00,929
your your experiences so at my company

00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:04,529
we have a fantastic creative team and

00:49:00,929 --> 00:49:07,169
I'm curious about how we can help them

00:49:04,529 --> 00:49:10,229
develop more savviness around the

00:49:07,169 --> 00:49:11,880
usability in the content and so that

00:49:10,229 --> 00:49:13,829
their designs that are producing

00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,589
reflects some of these principles that

00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:19,409
you share are you Drupal shop not only

00:49:16,589 --> 00:49:21,419
Drupal okay the the best thing I'd say

00:49:19,409 --> 00:49:24,119
is in the approach I've always taken to

00:49:21,419 --> 00:49:26,489
chapter three is like I believe it is my

00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:29,399
team's responsibility to understand the

00:49:26,489 --> 00:49:31,739
technology and so we do something called

00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:33,749
sharing Fridays where we get our doves

00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:36,899
and our designers and rpms and everyone

00:49:33,749 --> 00:49:39,809
in one room to just share anything it

00:49:36,899 --> 00:49:42,229
can be a question a problem and or an

00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:44,549
inspiration and getting those

00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:46,789
cross-disciplinary conversations going

00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:50,339
is kind of fundamental to understanding

00:49:46,789 --> 00:49:52,229
and just what each other struggle with

00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:53,909
as far as you know problem solving in

00:49:52,229 --> 00:49:55,529
the thing is is that developers and

00:49:53,909 --> 00:49:57,719
designers are the same they're both

00:49:55,529 --> 00:49:59,659
creatives you know it's like it's in

00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:02,669
there both problem solvers and so I

00:49:59,659 --> 00:50:07,259
would just work towards fostering a

00:50:02,669 --> 00:50:08,909
culture where each team learns and cares

00:50:07,259 --> 00:50:10,199
about how the other one achieves what

00:50:08,909 --> 00:50:13,259
they're doing and you figure out how to

00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:14,819
be a partner to each other so I'd say it

00:50:13,259 --> 00:50:17,699
comes from like a leisure a leadership

00:50:14,819 --> 00:50:19,769
standpoint and but yeah it's just a more

00:50:17,699 --> 00:50:22,559
of a willingness and something as simple

00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:24,630
as that as well we'll get it either just

00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,889
a quick add on to that so we do have

00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:27,659
that great collaboration between the

00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:29,819
development team and the creative team

00:50:27,659 --> 00:50:32,099
but the missing you know part of that

00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:35,459
that pyramid i think is really that

00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:38,130
content savviness so that's that's I

00:50:35,459 --> 00:50:40,469
guess more what I'm curious about is you

00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:43,499
know it would take someone on your team

00:50:40,469 --> 00:50:46,589
to care yeah about it so you would have

00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:48,089
to find well it is because I mean like I

00:50:46,589 --> 00:50:49,979
am basically having this talk it's like

00:50:48,089 --> 00:50:51,449
this isn't in my job description really

00:50:49,979 --> 00:50:51,850
I mean my job description is kind of

00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:54,850
what I

00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:58,360
I want it to be but like I just feel

00:50:54,850 --> 00:51:00,160
like this my clients need help and so I

00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:02,170
would just say you know maybe share this

00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,540
talkers or just ask them be like hey

00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:05,860
like do we want to get into this and it

00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:07,600
might even be the answer that you guys

00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:09,340
say as a company no we don't want to get

00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,260
into this we don't like will give it to

00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:13,240
them they can like either keep or screw

00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:15,220
up the site as they wish so it's I think

00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:17,320
it's a in some ways like who do you want

00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:19,000
to be as a company but for me I just

00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,190
feel like this is an opportunity and

00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,560
it's just a problem I guess because I

00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:25,690
truly want to see my clients succeed and

00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:28,330
so that's partially why I've been drawn

00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:34,030
towards trying to figure this out okay

00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:36,400
thanks so much sure hi I'm a drupal

00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:39,940
developer / SEMA team of Drupal

00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,370
developers and for myself the question I

00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:43,720
have is this in regards to the

00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:45,250
development that has to happen and

00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,110
rehearse the authoring experience that

00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:49,260
gets so often overlooked as opposed to

00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:51,010
development happens for user experience

00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:56,080
given a lot of the changes that have

00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:58,780
happened in with X park with da what

00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:00,910
couldn't be done better to actually make

00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:02,560
it so that the people were authoring and

00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:05,170
creating content within the CMS are

00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:07,840
actually having as a high quality of

00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:09,670
experience as user experience and a lot

00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:11,590
of it came from having read the book

00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:13,690
content everywhere we can only got which

00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:15,700
made me on our team the person who via

00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:19,270
really cares about content to larger

00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:21,910
budgets period because that's the thing

00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:23,260
is that like we do projects all the time

00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:24,810
and they're like hey I've got this

00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:27,250
amount of money and I want to do this

00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:29,260
unbelievably large list of things and we

00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:31,390
are like will do it for you man we're

00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:32,920
here for you but a lot of times on that

00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:35,260
list is not what you're talking about

00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,970
and I like I completely feel you like I

00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:39,280
want to see that too and there are

00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:43,120
projects or we've done it and they are

00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,890
pretty big budget because the work the

00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:46,330
development work it takes as you guys

00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:49,330
all know if you've done Drupal to go

00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:50,380
into the back end and customize it just

00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:53,350
to add those little things whether it's

00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:55,420
helper text or you know image size

00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:57,970
dimensions like every one of those

00:52:55,420 --> 00:53:00,370
microscopic tasks you know finessing the

00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:02,880
WYSIWYG to like debug it and like make

00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:04,710
it more user-friendly those things

00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,630
to add up in development hours cost a

00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:09,240
lot of money and a lot of companies just

00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:16,619
don't have those budgets but more money

00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:18,420
I work for University and market degree

00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:19,710
programs and the people I work with have

00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,750
a lot they want to say about degree

00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:24,000
programs and so trying to cut content is

00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:26,069
really difficult for them what a good

00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,019
solution be you know cutting that

00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:31,109
content for the web then linking people

00:53:28,019 --> 00:53:33,509
to a PDF you know with more details and

00:53:31,109 --> 00:53:35,670
that you know more more of that content

00:53:33,509 --> 00:53:38,339
they want to include and if that were a

00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:40,289
good solution how do you think about

00:53:38,339 --> 00:53:41,730
designing that PDF and looking at the

00:53:40,289 --> 00:53:43,500
content on the PDF knowing that's an

00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:45,619
electronic document rather than a print

00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:50,609
that's it that's a good question in

00:53:45,619 --> 00:53:53,940
general it is not recommended to show

00:53:50,609 --> 00:53:56,430
your content online in a PDF unless it

00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:58,890
technol technically doesn't make sense

00:53:56,430 --> 00:54:01,319
to put it on a website and the reason is

00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:04,019
that it's a lot easier to access that

00:54:01,319 --> 00:54:05,910
content when it's on a website in the in

00:54:04,019 --> 00:54:07,849
the example that you're giving I might

00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:12,029
recommend almost like an information

00:54:07,849 --> 00:54:14,339
architecture refresh where maybe there's

00:54:12,029 --> 00:54:16,529
one level on a high level that shows the

00:54:14,339 --> 00:54:18,690
the high level marketing communication

00:54:16,529 --> 00:54:21,000
goal is on the top level pages and then

00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:22,920
the deeper pages you can use to have you

00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,660
know more of the content so if you know

00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:26,970
you can have that conversation to figure

00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:28,829
out like what's top level what are

00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:30,329
deeper pages and how do you create an

00:54:28,829 --> 00:54:33,569
information architecture that doesn't

00:54:30,329 --> 00:54:36,630
just balloon out of control but PDFs in

00:54:33,569 --> 00:54:39,569
general like people have done it and it

00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:44,549
is a solution but the readability online

00:54:39,569 --> 00:54:46,140
is not as flexible and also like if you

00:54:44,549 --> 00:54:48,779
think of the long-term maintenance of it

00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:50,549
if you're like I've got 500 PDF so I

00:54:48,779 --> 00:54:53,609
have to update like that's going to suck

00:54:50,549 --> 00:54:55,099
so you know what I mean those are the

00:54:53,609 --> 00:54:57,960
things that you might want to consider

00:54:55,099 --> 00:55:00,450
but with it within all about those

00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:03,359
things with the goals like make that be

00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:04,799
your drive is ask yourself and clarify

00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:06,809
those goals upfront and that will help

00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:09,059
steer those conversations with your with

00:55:06,809 --> 00:55:10,859
your team so how do I convince the

00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:12,539
people i work with that people aren't

00:55:10,859 --> 00:55:14,189
going to print all these PDF

00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:15,630
to have on hand I mean that's a big

00:55:14,189 --> 00:55:17,189
thing I struggle with well they need

00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:19,109
something to print and when you print

00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:21,959
the website you know they they want this

00:55:19,109 --> 00:55:23,429
PDF you can do again probably some I

00:55:21,959 --> 00:55:26,640
don't know how to do like the print

00:55:23,429 --> 00:55:29,459
stats but there might be ways to look at

00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:32,519
that in your analytics or just ask 10

00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:34,019
users sure you know because that's

00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:36,359
always a good point it's like if you if

00:55:34,019 --> 00:55:38,669
you're ever stuck getting data helps

00:55:36,359 --> 00:55:40,049
those differences of opinion because

00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:42,269
that happens a lot within an

00:55:40,049 --> 00:55:44,130
organization where some use like I think

00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:45,989
this well I think that and it's like if

00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:48,269
you if you hit a roadblock you need a

00:55:45,989 --> 00:55:50,309
little data just to because otherwise

00:55:48,269 --> 00:55:55,229
it's like who's louder or more

00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:57,329
convincing sure okay thank you sure hi

00:55:55,229 --> 00:55:59,519
um it sounds like your role might be

00:55:57,329 --> 00:56:01,709
called content strategist I feel like

00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:04,140
I've heard that and maybe that's not

00:56:01,709 --> 00:56:05,910
accurate or not but um I'm just kind of

00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:08,099
curious how your role plays with the

00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:10,679
information architect in the ux person

00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:12,929
and if you're butting heads on things i

00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:14,579
do everyone great yeah and like there's

00:56:12,929 --> 00:56:16,049
ultimate say on these things because I

00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:19,169
imagine everyone wants their voice heard

00:56:16,049 --> 00:56:21,900
and how that's a really good question at

00:56:19,169 --> 00:56:24,179
chapter three like me and all my design

00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:26,669
team we actually do it all we do

00:56:24,179 --> 00:56:29,880
information architecture content

00:56:26,669 --> 00:56:31,589
strategy UX and design I know in some

00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:33,630
other places they'll like separate out

00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:35,819
those tasks but we've taken an approach

00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:39,329
where like those those things are so

00:56:35,819 --> 00:56:42,179
interwoven that we all do all of them

00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:43,979
and as I've been in this role longer I

00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:45,299
agree with you like I kind of think of

00:56:43,979 --> 00:56:48,059
myself more as a Content strategist

00:56:45,299 --> 00:56:51,299
because that that's in some ways the

00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:53,759
umbrella um but we don't butt heads

00:56:51,299 --> 00:56:55,979
because each of us is usually leading

00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:59,549
like we will sometimes like partner on a

00:56:55,979 --> 00:57:02,489
project but in general there's no it's

00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:08,669
there's no disagreement on things okay

00:57:02,489 --> 00:57:11,669
great thank you and what stage would you

00:57:08,669 --> 00:57:13,919
start to introduce content strategy into

00:57:11,669 --> 00:57:15,929
like the design you know it's a lot of

00:57:13,919 --> 00:57:19,769
times it'd be like a rush into wire

00:57:15,929 --> 00:57:21,539
frames or like what staged used I mean

00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:23,060
do you start to bring content into the

00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:24,950
wire frames or

00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:27,920
we try to do it from the very beginning

00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:29,540
so when you start a project to just by

00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,180
asking yourself like what the goals are

00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:33,920
and stuff that is strategy and it's

00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:36,590
going to relate to the content so we

00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:39,530
start on day one if you're asking

00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:42,110
specifically like do we put real content

00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:43,910
in wireframes I'd say that we take both

00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:45,110
approaches and we try to remain flexible

00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:47,240
for our clients because they're

00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:48,710
sometimes when like they're like we're

00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:50,930
on a super tight budget we have known we

00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:53,330
have no content just like take your best

00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:54,590
guess we've taken that approach and then

00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:57,170
we've also taken the approach where you

00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:58,760
put like the literal content in the

00:57:57,170 --> 00:58:01,520
wireframes and do high fidelity

00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:03,230
wireframing and they're like correcting

00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,330
my typos and I'm like you realize this

00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:08,170
is just a wireframe but like you know so

00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:10,910
so i would say that we do both in

00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:14,360
general the sooner you can get real

00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:16,310
content and there the better but because

00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:17,810
what we do has so many variables there

00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:20,210
are times when sometimes you just have

00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:21,650
to like put it in is when you get it

00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:23,390
because it's like we don't always have

00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:28,880
control over those things and we have to

00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:31,850
be flexible okay good thanks anybody

00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:36,250
else feel free to come and get some of

00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:36,250
