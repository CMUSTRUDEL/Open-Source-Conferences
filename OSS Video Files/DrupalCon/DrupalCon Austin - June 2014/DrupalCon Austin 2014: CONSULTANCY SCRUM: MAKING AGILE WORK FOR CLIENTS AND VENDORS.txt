WHY SCRUM IS DIFFICULT FOR VENDORS

Scrum and other agile methodologies were created by organizations to manage and develop their own products using their own resources. As a result, they're inward-facing. The stakeholders, Product Owner, Scrum Master, and team are all part of a single company. Budgets and resources are often managed by a single entity. All parties are invested in the process, which makes communication between stakeholders and the team relatively easy.

Vendors, however, are external to the client, so our Scrum must be outward-facing. We cannot rely on the client to be good stakeholders or Product Owners. Clients control the budget, and we control the resources. Not all parties are invested in process. Often, the client has hired us to simply make a problem "go away," and they don't care what methods are used to manage the project.

HOW CAN WE MAKE AGILE WORK FOR CLIENTS AND VENDORS?

In this session, we will explore this question in detail, drawing heavily from Four Kitchens' six years of experience bringing agile methodologies to our clients' projects. Our goal is to explain how we've modified scrum to work in a client-facing environment — and how you can make it work, too. The following topics will be covered:

Identifying the problem: Scrum was designed for products and internal teams and stakeholders. Consultancies work on projects with external teams and stakeholders.
Line-by-line comparison of Scrum Classic™ and Consultancy Scrum (Four Kitchens' approach).
Who should be the PO? The pros and cons of assigning Product Ownership to the client or vendor.
How to effectively manage clients' expectations and emotional needs by adding an Account Manager role to the project.
What a contract or "Scope of Work" means in an agile environment — and how to effectively manage them.
...And much more!

mostly bad puns hi I'm Susie Bane's

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,510
director of projects at four kitchens

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,620
[Music]

00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:50,550
Wow I'm Paul Benjamin project manager

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,980
and scrum master at four kitchens so

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,420
this is our project management team

00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,010
everybody is here today so you can ask

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,170
absolutely everybody for kitchens he

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,090
does project management how we do it so

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,520
this is a very rare and excellent

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,680
opportunity so before we get started

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,549
before I talk about the problem is I'd

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,619
like to know more about you so how many

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:12,869
of you would consider yourselves to be a

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:17,490
client you're somebody who hires other

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:19,170
people to help you do work all right and

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:23,280
how many of you are vendors you are

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:26,700
hired by clients to do work okay now of

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,729
the vendors how many of you do scrum or

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,079
agile or some flavor of that okay pretty

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,470
much everybody right who does not

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,909
actually that's more interesting

00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:39,900
smattering what do you do if you can

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:43,740
yell it out anybody all on

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:47,009
simultaneously waterfall anything just

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,360
whatever get it done okay a combination

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:53,009
waterfall something like that

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,720
got you okay so today we do assume a

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,340
fair amount of knowledge about scrum so

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,930
we're gonna be using scrum terminology

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,329
we're gonna be talking about POS and

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,549
sprints and things like that so if you

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,260
are totally new to scrum I'm sorry but

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,900
just sort of let it wash over you

00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,400
and we can talk about it later so to

00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,080
dive into all the terminology stuff

00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,150
here's the problem that we're here to

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,010
discuss this is the problem with using

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,770
scrum as a vendor when working with

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:20,310
clients scrum was originally designed

00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:23,250
for products with internal teams and

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,950
stakeholders meaning you are an

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,020
organization like Microsoft Google IBM

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,650
you're building a product that you own

00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,300
and that you sell and you're all of your

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,860
resources and your team and everybody

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,290
you're on or one roof you share one

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,090
culture one organization so something

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,590
goes wrong it's between divisions or

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:45,330
it's all vertically stacked within one

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:48,750
team consultancies however vendors we

00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:51,600
work on projects and we're dealing with

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,610
external teams and stakeholders what I

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,490
mean by the difference between products

00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,709
and projects is we are hired by our

00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:01,560
clients to help them with something that

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,030
might be a content oriented site or a

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,400
transactional website or an application

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,860
or a piece of software or something but

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,630
ultimately they own it not us we're

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,180
hired hands to work on a project for

00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:14,070
them that they then own and control so

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,720
there's a subtle but very important

00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,640
difference there and also we're working

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,970
with their external teams and

00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,160
stakeholders so where is it we were all

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,220
Microsoft or Google or IBM or whatever

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,590
Apple our stakeholders might be our

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,540
bosses or it might be our peers in a

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,280
department next to us like marketing or

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,440
communications or something like that

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,000
but in this case it's the person who's

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,410
paying us it's the group of people who

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
are actually signing the checks at the

00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,530
end of the day so there's a very

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,110
different kind of relationship and some

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,430
different tensions that come into play

00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:46,260
that's the fundamental problem that we

00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:50,550
are trying to solve with consultancy

00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,870
scrum so to review here are some of the

00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,090
characteristics of what we're going to

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,739
call today scrum classic this is

00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,810
traditional scrum that everybody knows

00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,040
if you've worked in a big Soccer company

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,019
or really any kind of soccer company

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,310
you're working on products there's

00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:03,840
something that you own and control in

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,000
their years and whether you sell them or

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,519
not that's your problem you own em you

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,570
control them everything is internally

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,400
facing you're dealing with your

00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:14,970
co-workers constantly everybody you talk

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,790
to as a co-worker your stakeholders

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,449
control all

00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:21,070
the resources so they have the budget

00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:23,050
the personnel the tools that you're

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,550
using and the scope the stakeholders

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,430
control all about and you're all part of

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,810
one culture and one of the tenants of

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,669
scrum is that it's done when it's done

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:33,220
when it's good enough to go live let's

00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:37,180
go live and the stakeholders all agree

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,560
with them in consultancy scrum however

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,600
again we're working on projects were

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,039
hired hands and ultimately our clients

00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,960
owned whatever it is we're building and

00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:45,220
that might be a product to them but it's

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,800
a project to us

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,389
it's externally facing because we're

00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,800
working with their team sometimes we're

00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:55,270
awed menteng their team's or working

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:58,479
with them or their the product owner but

00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,830
mainly they are the stakeholders both of

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,690
our organizations clients and

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,840
consultancies share control of the

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,560
resources so clients control the budget

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,639
because they're the ones that have the

00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,280
money they're gonna pay you that's how

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,289
you get paid you the consultancy the

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,880
vendor you control the personnel who

00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:15,220
works on it for how long that's up to

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,770
you because you all work together within

00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,419
your consultancy and both parties the

00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,680
clients and the consultancies are

00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:24,159
expected to control the scope

00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:27,039
theoretically and one of the biggest

00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:29,409
things the differentiates consultancies

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,060
from from scrum classic is it's not

00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:32,949
necessarily done when it's done

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,260
according to the stakeholders it's done

00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:36,729
when the client is happy so when the

00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,909
client says yep this is done this is

00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:43,630
good we're good that's when the project

00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:44,919
is actually done so to talk about some

00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,870
of the very specific ways and if you

00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:52,310
modified scrum you're Suzy Bates our

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:54,930
director projects morning

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,389
so as Todd mentioned we're going to talk

00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,949
about the differences between we sort of

00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:02,699
have a top 10 list of things that we

00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:04,229
found that we modified standard scrum so

00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:07,520
we're not going to talk about you know

00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:09,479
scrum fall or any sort of a weird

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,280
amalgamation of scrum that's really sort

00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:13,110
of following the classic tenets of scrum

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,180
but how do we make it work for working

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:20,120
with clients and working with the team

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:24,750
that has an external stakeholders so

00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:29,070
let's start with the backlog so the

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:32,580
backlog is a list of stories that the

00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:34,349
product owner writes prioritizes and

00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:38,940
then they do the planning of the

00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:41,070
iterations and the releases we we like

00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:44,190
to our in in up in a class scrum classic

00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:47,370
situation a ready sized backlog meaning

00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:49,229
a backlog that has the entire list of

00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:52,320
feature stories whether they're in epics

00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:55,949
or user stories themselves are defined

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,320
so you know 10 sprints down the road

00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:01,260
what the stories are it's not really

00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,760
necessary in scrum classic except for

00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,880
the release planning part of it so you

00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:08,220
can do iteration by iteration planning

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,039
we found in consultancy scrum product

00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,349
owners still writes the stories

00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:15,560
prioritizes the backlogs plans

00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:18,780
iterations and releases that's the same

00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:22,139
what's different is we need a ready size

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:24,690
backlog from the beginning we found if

00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:27,900
we say oh we'll just do it sprint by

00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:30,659
sprint then it's easier to go off track

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,250
and it's easier to miss the goals

00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:34,320
whether it's the budget or the timeline

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,389
or the feature set that need to be

00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,550
accomplished

00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:42,150
similarly defining the MVP from the

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:44,090
beginning is really important and it's

00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:46,229
great to put a milestone on that MVP

00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,960
throw a little party when you get to

00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:52,380
that point because it gives the client

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,320
an idea of what's required and what's

00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,330
nice to have which of course is always

00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,880
it's hard to to draw that line but

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,550
saying Minimum Viable Product helps the

00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,309
client understand

00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:06,919
what they're gonna get that's really

00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:10,659
feasibly workable and then where do we

00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,659
add the bells and whistles later

00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:17,779
so daily scrum in scrum classic the

00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:19,429
product owner scrum master and team all

00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:22,610
attend they give their daily updates

00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:26,389
remove blockers sometimes even review

00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:28,969
stories in scrum in consultancy scrum

00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:32,089
same thing same people attend we have

00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:35,329
the product owner scrum master team we

00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:38,509
share our updates but we really like to

00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:40,610
include the client this is sometimes

00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:42,259
challenging because often the client has

00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:44,750
come to us and said we have a problem

00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:47,240
that we don't have time to fix so we're

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,790
hiring you because you have the time and

00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,790
then you say great can you be in a 15

00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,949
minutes from every day and they say

00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:57,860
that's a lot I'm busy and I can't be

00:08:54,949 --> 00:09:00,259
there so sometimes you have to accept

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,620
that they can't attend occasionally we

00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:07,819
add a weekly client check-in meeting in

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:11,810
order to replace the daily scrum with

00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:13,189
the client it's great to have them come

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:15,860
to the scrum but sometimes you have to

00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:22,579
be a little bit flexible to include them

00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:24,980
according to their schedule so demos at

00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:28,189
the end of each scrum the team

00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:31,100
demonstrates their work at the end of

00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:33,769
each sprint sorry the product owner is

00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:36,459
there to accept or reject the stories

00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:43,189
and they represent the stakeholder

00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:48,769
stakeholders so in consultancy scrum we

00:09:43,189 --> 00:09:51,160
like to do pre demos before the demo we

00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:54,079
like for the Sprint demo to be sort of a

00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,180
formal acceptance of work that everybody

00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:59,360
is already familiar with so we do pre

00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,630
demos whether they're ad-hoc you just

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,220
ping

00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,470
someone and get them on the line as

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:07,060
shown some new feature or we sometimes

00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:11,050
schedule them if we have a particularly

00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:13,190
schedule limited client then we'll put a

00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,590
standing meeting on their calendar and

00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,820
then show them what we've got but

00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,830
they're really important in getting

00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:22,310
their feedback before you get to the end

00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:24,740
of the scrub of this print and then the

00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:27,380
main difference with demos is both the

00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,510
client and the product owner who could

00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:35,150
or couldn't be the client accept or

00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:37,610
reject stories in the demo so you

00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:40,190
probably familiar with the fast good and

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:43,550
cheap you might also be familiar with

00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:45,950
this triangle which is is it on time is

00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:48,890
it on budget or the features the most

00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:53,780
important so in scrum classic you say

00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:55,580
peak - which one is it so you encourage

00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:58,070
the product owner and the stakeholders

00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,780
in scrum classic to say you know we need

00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,810
to be on time and on budget but if we

00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:05,990
don't get all the features we're okay

00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:08,810
and then you fine-tune the backlog to

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,340
allow for that if your timeline is

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:13,700
flexible then you might add an extra

00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:17,390
sprint to get those last features in but

00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:20,630
but there's always one that's been in

00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:22,610
consultancy scrum no matter how much the

00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:25,640
client wants to tell you that budget is

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:30,200
flexible budget is not flexible so you

00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:31,850
get to pick two budgets one of them the

00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,110
reason this is is that you're in a

00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:37,820
contractual agreement with someone and

00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,930
the main thing that's on the contract is

00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,290
how much does it gonna cost

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:46,400
so by saying oh don't worry we've got

00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:48,140
more money you say great let's change it

00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,480
let's make a statement of work for the

00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,970
additional money or we'll drive to the

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,450
original budget and then when you go get

00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:58,310
more money we'll do things - so the

00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:02,240
promise of don't worry the money doesn't

00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:05,540
matter is fine if it's in a contract but

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,720
the contract always has a number so it's

00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,120
so that's where you really were

00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:14,920
on the timeline or the feature to be the

00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:17,980
bendy part and then additionally you

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:20,170
always want to share the budget with the

00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,480
team and the client on an ongoing basis

00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,819
so we have a report we send out at the

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,740
end of every sprint that says this is

00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:28,269
how much money you told us you wanted to

00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,829
spend this is how much we spent so far

00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:32,740
this is our prediction for the future

00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:34,870
and does that equal zero plus or minus

00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,019
so it's good for the team and the client

00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:42,670
to know how we're tracking to the budget

00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:45,699
as we progress all right let's talk

00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:48,220
about velocity how fast are we going are

00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:51,910
we going to make it if we have 10

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,589
Sprint's and we're only doing five

00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,870
points of sprint then we're only going

00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:59,589
to get 50 points total so one

00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:01,329
interesting part about so I like I like

00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:02,680
the velocity question when the

00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:05,529
difference comes up between scrum

00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,470
classic and consultancy scrum in the law

00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:12,480
ends run classic it's really in your

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:15,699
best interest to keep your team static

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,500
so you want to key and you know people

00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:19,569
do this differently but you want to try

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,160
and keep this team static so that they

00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:23,620
get their practices together their

00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,259
velocity can increase sprint over sprint

00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:31,360
and your predictability of velocity is

00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:33,939
really high so this is challenging and

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,889
consultancy scrum we roll people in and

00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:38,410
out of projects they have different

00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:41,439
skill sets to accomplish different

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:44,980
portions of the project so staffing is

00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:47,379
very fluid and variable one rule we do

00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:50,199
follow is anyone who's rolled onto a

00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:52,779
project is rolled on at the Sprint

00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:54,970
kickoff we've never rolled anyone on in

00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:58,149
the middle of a sprint and they stay

00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:00,850
until the demo so we know that even if

00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:04,240
it's Wednesday Wednesday that person is

00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:06,519
allocated to this project so this makes

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,250
for some fun velocity cup calculations

00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:11,259
so you might say you know this sprint we

00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,269
have four people we got 20 points done

00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:14,910
we're gonna add someone the next sprint

00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:18,240
so that means we can do

00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:20,790
five points so our velocity as you can

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,810
imagine this is not as accurate as

00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:26,850
keeping a stable team so you have to be

00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:29,750
open to the velocity is not as

00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:32,610
predictable as in regular scrum classic

00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:35,760
but it's really important to retain a

00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:38,250
core team member or members so that

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,620
you're not swapping people wholesale out

00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,900
and you're not leaving we like to call

00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,390
them a consistent resource and they may

00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:48,270
be the lead developer or they may just

00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:50,130
be a developer who's going to be on the

00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,870
team but the leads walks in and out as

00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:55,020
long as someone has the tribal knowledge

00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:56,940
to go from the beginning to the end this

00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:59,400
allows us to have consistency of

00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,410
knowledge coding practices our

00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,390
definition of done doesn't vary all over

00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:06,540
the place depending on people and then

00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:08,580
also it gives the client some feeling of

00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:11,160
consistency but even if you bring

00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,840
someone in sorry in the middle and they

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,250
roll off after a couple of Sprint's they

00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,750
at least know that Bob's going to be

00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:20,340
there at the kickoff and they're gonna

00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:22,020
be there at the rollout so over time

00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:25,680
this is actually something that's rarely

00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:28,590
talked about into Brown so when we talk

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,660
about scrum classic at the beginning of

00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:33,720
a sprint you sit down and you have your

00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:36,510
team estimate the stories and make a

00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,550
commitment they understand the scope and

00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:41,100
they say we'll do whatever it takes to

00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:44,780
get this done even if it means working

00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:48,180
overtime which actually is not irregular

00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,930
what is the cost of a project of

00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,930
overtime

00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:54,690
well it's goodwill it's your team taking

00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:56,940
their personal time to meet a commitment

00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:00,060
this is a good thing and it's generally

00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:02,550
thought of as a positive thing in

00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:05,400
consultancy scrum when you have a fixed

00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:07,680
fee project the overtime cost is also

00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:11,250
goodwill you don't have any additional

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:14,670
monetary costs for for this overtime

00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:17,270
work but when you're working on a time

00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:19,680
and materials hourly billable project

00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,449
you may not realize that working

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,040
overtime

00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:24,889
chillie impacts your budget

00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,379
predictability so you knew you were

00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:29,569
gonna burn this much time but you have a

00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:34,540
big spike for this sprint that means

00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:37,309
that sprint number 12 is actually gone

00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:40,249
do you have less Sprint's at that point

00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:41,839
because you have a fixed budget so

00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:44,079
because of this only when we have

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,339
clients who are really budget driven

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,970
sometimes we'll let stories are all over

00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:51,739
and we won't make a big deal out of it

00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:53,959
but I mean the team really does want to

00:16:51,739 --> 00:16:57,169
commit so we do talk about like let's

00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:58,939
get it done in the time we have and that

00:16:57,169 --> 00:17:01,929
that seems to work for them as well they

00:16:58,939 --> 00:17:05,510
understand those those give and take

00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:07,579
it's a client management you don't have

00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,750
any clients in scrum classic so you

00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:10,399
don't really have to worry about client

00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,860
management you have two stakeholders and

00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:15,199
there are humans involved so there are

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:19,419
people management but you don't really

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:24,139
have to worry about that external client

00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:26,720
in consultancy scrum we really like to

00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:30,200
have one person who is outside of the

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:33,799
team that the client and team knows that

00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:37,460
they can go to this person we call the

00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:39,320
Account Manager they know about what's

00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,510
going on in the project they understand

00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,519
the client's needs and they're a

00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:45,950
sounding board for good things and bad

00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:48,139
things there when things go off the

00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:51,980
rails it's someone outside of the team

00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:54,380
that the client can go to to talk to

00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,690
also this account manager calls them on

00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:59,570
a regular basis to make sure that

00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:02,600
they're okay because a project is not

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:05,899
just code it's often wrapped up in a

00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:08,000
client's emotional needs I've had a

00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:10,820
project that was highly tied to someone

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,340
to review before and so it's really good

00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,350
to know these sort of personal items and

00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:18,350
the account manager is sort of that

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:21,860
personal contact that that allows for

00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:23,299
that at the same time I went to our

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,519
accountant Andrew yesterday about a

00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:27,409
project because it was a great place for

00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:30,300
me to go and we were having a problem

00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:32,640
with the client to sound out

00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,170
some ideas you know well how can we

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:39,720
address this new problem that we have

00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:42,620
before going to the client so contracts

00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,810
and statements work in scrum classic

00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:47,310
usually they're not necessary so you're

00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:51,360
not really dealing with contractually

00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:53,160
obligated deliveries of work within an

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,740
internal organization for scrum classic

00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:59,070
in consultancy scrum you should have the

00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:01,560
contract as we all know it's best you

00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:03,390
have a statement of work so that people

00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,580
know what they're gonna get an idea of

00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,440
when they're going to get it and the

00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:11,640
features they're going to receive now

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:15,360
remember we talked about pick three it's

00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:18,060
best to not be really prescriptive about

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,160
the bhindi thing so if they say oh no

00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,720
time line doesn't matter then it's

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,120
probably best not to put a hard deadline

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:28,020
in your contract so when we say things

00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:31,500
are appropriately they it means have

00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:33,420
your contract meet your you're sure the

00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,810
way that you do things so if your

00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:38,610
feature set is in the backlog then maybe

00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:42,270
you'll have an overview epic a list of

00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:45,210
ethics in your contract but if you list

00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:46,500
out stories in your contract then you

00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:49,350
have to do a change order when you

00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,480
reprioritize the backlog you really

00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:54,650
don't want to do a change order when you

00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:58,230
do anything to the backlog however

00:19:54,650 --> 00:20:00,420
sometimes the clients goals change they

00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:04,740
have an epiphany moment where their

00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:06,510
business plan changes or we're really or

00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,950
they come along and they say we we want

00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,510
to get you know a whole new set of

00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,120
features to add on the end of this this

00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:14,100
phase then you need a new a new

00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,310
statement of work you need to adjust the

00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,740
contract any monetary changes need a new

00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:21,840
statement of work but those things again

00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,840
should be appropriately vague so that

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,130
the process can manage itself without

00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:31,470
having to have all the

00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:34,290
overhead change orders so next preparing

00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:38,310
for launch in scrum classic if you're

00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:41,460
doing it right your QA and testing in

00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:43,530
each sprint so at the end of the Sprint

00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,450
when stories are accepted you can push

00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:50,070
it straight into the staging server

00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:53,670
production server and launch in

00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:56,610
consultancies from the code and the team

00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:59,910
may be ready when you're done with that

00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:02,550
last sprint you're done we've we've done

00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:05,220
it right in QA and if we have continuous

00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:08,220
integration so it goes to to the staging

00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,530
server the question is the clients not

00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:13,050
always ready sometimes they need some

00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:16,230
time to get some last-minute content in

00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:17,880
the system sometimes they need a really

00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,050
a last look seat to make sure that

00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,630
everything is the way they want it so

00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:24,480
they'll do some testing it gives us the

00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:27,180
opportunity to pick some bugs but then

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,220
the thing that happens when it's not on

00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:33,600
a hosted system when they're hosting it

00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:36,210
themselves there's often a process that

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,800
could be up to a week to get it onto

00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:41,060
their production servers working with

00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:43,770
their IT so if you don't allow for this

00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,240
then you're basically saying like we

00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,440
finished our sprint and then the next

00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,780
sprint you're gonna go on and start

00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,510
building features but who's gonna make

00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:52,350
sure that I tease that's what they need

00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:54,660
so that's why we like to have this

00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:56,850
hardening sprint which is a an

00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:03,740
acceptance of the time that the client

00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:03,740
needs yes yeah

00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:12,820
no no we've been in contact all along

00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:16,659
but sometimes in it everybody's process

00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:19,090
is different so we've had clients with

00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:20,830
internal IT who are ready to go the

00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:23,770
minute we are but there are some who

00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:26,320
just have those steps that need to

00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:29,440
happen or they only release on Wednesday

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,789
or things like that that sometimes will

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,789
will add to the process

00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:46,429
well we should know it in the first

00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:49,640
print because we are engaging with you

00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:55,820
on a staging server prior to this this

00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:58,250
is really just going live steps so

00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:00,590
finally let's talk about the product

00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:04,279
donor as we said the product owner is

00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:06,409
responsible for the product they guide

00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:08,029
the roadmap the backlog iterations

00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:10,669
releases sometimes are even worried

00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:12,980
about profit and loss of their product

00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:15,890
they're doing marketing analysis they're

00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:18,350
looking at competitive analysis product

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:20,990
owners and scrum classic are usually

00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:26,120
professionals whose job it is to manage

00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:28,640
a product so in consultancy scrum we

00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:32,090
need a product owner - but it's not

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,700
product so in order to use ubiquitous

00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:37,190
language we've called it project owner

00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,260
it's more accurate and it gives everyone

00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:43,010
an idea of exactly what the scope of the

00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:44,179
work is I'm gonna hand it over poll and

00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:47,020
he's gonna talk to us about who should

00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:47,020
be the product owner

00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:55,720
thank you Susie so when we talk about

00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:57,970
who should be the PIO is it somebody on

00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:02,380
the client side or is it somebody at the

00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:05,950
consultancy you can assign the role to

00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:08,410
somebody on the client side every time

00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,690
if you're able to do so and that is

00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:12,490
absolutely the preference if you can get

00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,990
somebody on the client side to come in

00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:16,390
and take that kind of ownership of the

00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,750
project and they can be involved that is

00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:21,130
ideal for consultancy scrum but

00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,960
sometimes they're not available you know

00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:24,160
like Susie talked about sometimes they

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,260
have time constraints and they're not

00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,600
available to do that in which case

00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:31,360
somebody at the consultancy can take on

00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:34,140
the role of the PIA what's most

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,880
important is that whoever that Pio is

00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:39,310
everybody has agreed that they have the

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,930
power to make these big decisions so

00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:43,150
even if it's somebody on the consultancy

00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:46,360
side the client was officially signed

00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:48,640
off and said yes that person at your

00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,620
company is representing our best

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,630
interests and we're going to trust them

00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:54,130
and we're going to know that they're

00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:59,190
going to be in there approving stories

00:24:54,130 --> 00:25:01,780
and that's cool we're down with that but

00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,790
most of the time when you're doing this

00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:06,190
in consultancy scrum you've got the

00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:09,850
client coming in performing the job as

00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:11,620
the PIO it's a new role to them then in

00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:13,720
some cases we've worked with places

00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,850
where there's a person who is super

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,350
knowledgeable and is used to scrum and

00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:19,840
they've done this kind of thing a lot in

00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:21,670
that case it can be quite easy but

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,440
sometimes it's somebody who has never

00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:25,930
even heard of scrum or they've heard of

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,540
scrum but they've never done it so in

00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:30,310
those cases it's your job to teach them

00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:32,950
the skills that they need to be an

00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:36,670
effective PA so they need to learn all

00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:40,060
about scrum user stories and as a as an

00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:43,120
ex I want this feature to do why so that

00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:47,110
I can get this result they also need to

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,910
understand the prioritization of those

00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:52,450
stories and how to figure out what is

00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:54,880
that MVP and how do I figure out which

00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:58,000
features I'm going to need first so that

00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:01,420
I can continue building you also need to

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,330
teach them how to accept stories and why

00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:06,270
that's important

00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:08,130
so for example I've had clients who they

00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:10,680
get kind of nervous oh we're in the demo

00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:12,240
and I'm accepting this story and I don't

00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,860
know once they accept this we're moving

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,260
on and I can't ever come back to it you

00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,700
can explain to them you know it's okay

00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,930
we can always write a new user story

00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,250
that captures this additional

00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:22,170
functionality if you come up with

00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:24,900
something but it's important that we

00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:27,120
accept this does it meet this definition

00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,880
of dawn that we've come up with let's

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,620
move on at the same time you don't want

00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,660
a client who just says oh well you guys

00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:35,220
said it's done it must be done I trust

00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,480
you you're the experts right you need to

00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,400
make sure that they're testing these

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,640
stories and that they're making sure

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,640
that whatever features you've built are

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:48,450
what you have all agreed it should be

00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:52,500
and then there's this idea of the thin

00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:54,840
vertical slice instrum and how is this

00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,340
thing done that's not really done so I'm

00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,950
coming to the client and I'm saying

00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,900
here's a bike frame and it's got some

00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:04,230
wheels on it and there's handlebars and

00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,640
a seat here you go and they have to be

00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,510
able to look at that and go but there's

00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,550
no brakes

00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:10,920
right what am I going to do with this

00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:13,260
thing and help them understand this is

00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:17,180
just the prototype this is the bike so

00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:19,950
far then you also have to teach them

00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:21,900
when it's a good time to include their

00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:24,570
other stakeholders within their company

00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:26,790
you don't necessarily want their boss or

00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:29,010
their boss's boss's boss to come in and

00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:30,330
look at this proto bike and throw their

00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:34,190
hands up in the air and say there's no

00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:36,300
brakes there's no gears for me to switch

00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:39,210
there's no little ringabel

00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,230
that's not a bike I'm furious at the

00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,060
same time you don't want the

00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,260
stakeholders in their company to come in

00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,970
so late that they look at this proto

00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:51,090
bike and go I thought we were building a

00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:53,370
car however sometimes that client can't

00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:55,500
serve the role of the PIO sometimes

00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:58,380
they're too busy there could be many

00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,820
many reasons in that case they still

00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,120
need to be involved they still need to

00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:04,950
have that deep understanding of what it

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,700
is that you're building what your goals

00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:08,160
are

00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,830
what's the MVP how are we going to get

00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,590
there they need to be involved in those

00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:14,610
critical decisions so raise your hands

00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,169
you don't need to raise your hands

00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,960
you've probably never experienced this

00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:20,609
sometimes when a project things don't

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,049
quite go as expected and you have to

00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:25,259
make some changes there's a change in

00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:26,850
priority somewhere or there's a there's

00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:28,320
an issue with the budget because you

00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,580
know we've owned some over time and now

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,889
we're gonna have to lose a sprint at the

00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,779
end let's make some big changes let's

00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:35,609
make some big decisions somebody from

00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:38,429
the client side needs to be involved

00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:40,769
there's that that term in scrum classic

00:28:38,429 --> 00:28:42,989
that the PIO is the single renewable net

00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:45,690
and what we don't really like that

00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:47,580
terminology so much it is true that you

00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,830
need somebody on the client side who can

00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,899
say yes you know I've been involved this

00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:54,840
whole time and I accept responsibility

00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:58,289
for these decisions they also need to

00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:00,179
attend those demos and accept those

00:28:58,289 --> 00:29:02,789
stories and also make sure that they're

00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:05,039
testing those features the to make sure

00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:06,210
that they fit their needs right so

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,100
what's interesting here is we say

00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:10,619
they're going to accept the stories

00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:13,019
we've already empowered somebody on the

00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:14,970
consultancy side to be the one who

00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:17,489
accepts user stories and the client has

00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:19,980
already said yes that's cool you

00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:22,440
represent us we trust you you can accept

00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,239
those stories you still need that person

00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,489
in the client side at the demo to say

00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:28,710
I'm still down with that

00:29:26,489 --> 00:29:32,580
I still agree you're still empowered

00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:34,559
it's okay they also need to be available

00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,330
for that frequent communication right so

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,369
maybe they can't be in this from

00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,629
everyday maybe there are limitations on

00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:41,369
their time you still need to be able to

00:29:39,629 --> 00:29:42,480
get a hold of them you still need to

00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:45,690
make sure that they're involved in the

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,429
process and then we've got this idea of

00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:50,340
this weekly backlog review where we get

00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:52,710
together with the client and we sit down

00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:54,480
and we go through that backlog make sure

00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:57,269
everything is still in its proper

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,859
priority and one of the most important

00:29:57,269 --> 00:30:00,929
things to do and this can be especially

00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:03,239
important with the client who is new to

00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:04,619
the scrum process is to make sure that

00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:06,840
you're looking at those stories that are

00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:08,639
at the bottom of the backlog because

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,230
it's easy for a client the same well

00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:11,759
I've already prioritized all these

00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:13,019
stories so let's just look at these ones

00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,789
at the top that are coming up for the

00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:17,820
next sprint those are the most important

00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:20,070
ones right in a way those stories at the

00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:21,659
bottom of the backlog are actually the

00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:23,129
most important because those are the

00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:25,400
ones that are in jeopardy of dropping

00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:27,260
off the list if you're run

00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,760
behind on your user stories and you're

00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,160
not going to get to everything in the

00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,270
backlog which is frankly the case most

00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,950
of the time right you build a big

00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:35,600
backlog and there's a lot of features

00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:37,550
that you know eventually you're gonna

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,680
have to flex and say well maybe we'll do

00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:40,790
that later right those are the stories

00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,890
that are going to drop off the backlog

00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:45,710
first so it's important to make sure

00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:47,360
that you're paying attention to those in

00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:50,600
those weekly calls and really taking a

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:55,310
look and checking out that those are

00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:59,210
going to be in good shape a few rules of

00:30:55,310 --> 00:31:02,600
having a consultant Pio you should never

00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:04,810
have the consultant side Pio serving as

00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,580
a designer or developer on the project

00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:10,580
right so hey I'm Paul and I'm building

00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:13,460
this feature here you go Paul thanks

00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:15,770
Paul great word thanks Paul see you

00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:19,190
later all right that's not really your

00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:22,490
best scenario so it's important to have

00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:24,080
the designer and developers focused on

00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:25,790
their work it also keeps them from

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,290
having to task switch from you know

00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,970
being down here in the weeds on their

00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:31,610
feature and then trying to get this

00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:33,890
high-level view of the whole project you

00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:36,530
can have a designer or developer who's

00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:38,320
working on another project be the PIO on

00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:44,630
this project that can sometimes work

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:46,610
also the scrum master can also sometimes

00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:48,620
be the piano this is a big no-no in

00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:52,430
scrum classic and scrum classic they say

00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:55,250
the PIO and the scrum master should

00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:57,590
never be the same person but there have

00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:59,480
been cases where we have determined that

00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:01,280
this was the best way to proceed and and

00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:06,080
it has been successful for us on those

00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:07,460
projects so a little note on the

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,670
structure of the team for those of you

00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:14,000
who are visual learners you can see here

00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:17,480
the client is in blue and the

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,070
consultancy is in green and you look at

00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,210
that product donor that product owner

00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:25,280
owner can actually take either role and

00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:27,020
it's an important again to remember that

00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,000
account manager role that is somebody

00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:31,310
outside of the team it can be great to

00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,080
have the client bounce some ideas off of

00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:35,169
them and then

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,390
they can come to the project manager or

00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:39,250
the scrum master and say hey the client

00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:40,419
getting the sense that they're feeling

00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,279
this or they set out right they're

00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:44,169
feeling this you know let's talk about

00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:47,409
this what are some solutions that we can

00:32:44,169 --> 00:32:50,289
go back to them with but the simple fact

00:32:47,409 --> 00:32:52,149
is that scrum doesn't always work and

00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:54,549
this is why there are a lot of places

00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:57,429
that you know well we're doing scrum but

00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:58,720
right it's from bud

00:32:57,429 --> 00:33:02,470
let me change this or that or the other

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:06,870
and we like to think of scrum as the

00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:10,360
sort of delicious gooey center of the

00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:13,450
project building feature building

00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:15,309
process so when you're doing scrum and

00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:17,769
you're building things that's when scrum

00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:21,760
works really well but in the design

00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:24,039
phase at the beginning it becomes sort

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,860
of questionable right because design

00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:30,929
tasks tend to be things that are tasks

00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:33,399
right you're gathering user personas or

00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:35,590
you're making style tiles or you're

00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:37,000
building the style guide these are tasks

00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:39,789
that you do one and then another and

00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,529
then another that kind of sounds like

00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:43,330
waterfall and we've tried that we've

00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:46,480
said okay during the design phase we're

00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:48,399
just going to be waterfall but frankly

00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,899
we haven't done waterfall and so long or

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,720
not as used to waterfall we're kind of

00:33:49,899 --> 00:33:55,269
used to scrum at the same time sometimes

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,580
you'll have design doing their work and

00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:59,440
at the same time that design is doing

00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,850
their work you're already doing some

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,860
feature building maybe there's a feature

00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:04,240
that isn't necessarily involved in the

00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:05,649
design process we're building this

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,080
editor and you know this is how it's

00:34:05,649 --> 00:34:09,790
going to work and we don't really need

00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,010
to worry about the style tiles or any of

00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:14,139
that stuff yet so most people are

00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:15,669
working on a scrum schedule right

00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:17,260
because they're building a feature and

00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:19,470
at the same time you've got design

00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:21,700
people who are kind of doing tasks so

00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:26,129
what we have found to be most successful

00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:29,290
is to do these design tasks and

00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:31,629
integrate them into our scrum process so

00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:32,429
we track the tasks in JIRA they're

00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:35,119
written

00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:38,399
tasks not necessarily user stories and

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,079
their time box to that two-week period

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,540
during which we're doing that

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,819
development right so at the very least

00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:48,480
it's setting up regular deadlines for

00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:49,980
those design tasks then also when you

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,809
get to the end of the process scrum

00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,460
starts to maybe feel like it's not the

00:34:51,809 --> 00:34:55,800
best practice and I mean there are

00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,210
plenty of places where hey we're going

00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,550
to address all of your bugs here while

00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:03,240
we're supporting we're supporting a

00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:04,559
product and you know you did this work

00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,240
and you're gonna get it in two weeks

00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:08,790
when we do the demo we'll roll it all up

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,559
at once but a lot of times clients are

00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:12,300
oh my god my you know my hair's on fire

00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:13,980
I've got this big problem with the thing

00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,750
that you gave me and I need this fixed

00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:18,359
right away because otherwise the world

00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:19,410
is going to explode I'd rather not tell

00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:21,750
that person they need to wait two weeks

00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:23,010
for it so at that point we go into

00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:26,040
something that's more like a Kanban

00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:28,500
system where we do the work we demo it

00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:32,460
for them immediately they accept it it

00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:38,970
rolls straight up to production and to

00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:41,700
continue the conversation here's Todd so

00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:44,640
we've been working on our modifications

00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:47,069
to scrum for I guess about the past six

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,710
or seven years this is definitely a work

00:35:47,069 --> 00:35:51,720
in progress and I see lots of

00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:53,760
opportunities talking with all of you

00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,579
and other project managers and scrum

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,099
masters and web shops to understand

00:35:56,579 --> 00:36:02,880
everybody else's pain points so for

00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:05,490
example the idea to not use scrum in the

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,260
design phase was the result of a handful

00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:11,069
of conversations I had with designers I

00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:13,440
was on a panel about scrum maybe about a

00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:15,750
year ago and half of the people on the

00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:20,130
panels were on the panel were designers

00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:21,180
and these designers just hated scrum

00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,069
they were there to be on the panel to

00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,750
say that scrum is terrible and I was

00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:27,839
there to somehow defend it and what we

00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:29,880
discovered is that we actually agreed on

00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:32,040
what it's not good at they were just

00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,290
taking like a sort of an oversimplified

00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,000
approach and I was trying to apply scrum

00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:39,030
to cases where it wasn't really working

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,440
so one of the ways that that the

00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,110
designers explained one of their many

00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:45,190
complaints

00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:48,820
from was that dividing a design task

00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:52,060
into a series of user stories was like

00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:55,470
like looking at a landscape through a

00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:57,340
paper towel tube you know you see like a

00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:58,660
circle and then you kind of move it a

00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,400
little bit you see another circle and

00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:02,980
you kind of do that a lot of times and

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,810
you get a kind of like a Swiss cheese

00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:06,340
sort of effect of the design and there

00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:08,040
are lots of gaps in between right you

00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:10,300
get the general picture you understand

00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,380
like mainly what's happening but it's

00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:15,120
really hard to take a step back and

00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:17,980
really gather the whole experience plus

00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,870
scrum when it's executed in this you

00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:21,880
know sprint by Sprint story by story way

00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:24,040
it's really difficult to go back and

00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,690
redo work that you've done before you're

00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:29,560
totally welcome to do that and scrum

00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:31,150
encourages that but it let's face it on

00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:34,240
a client project with a limited budget

00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:36,490
and a deadline those stories to go back

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,900
and redo the first design task that you

00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:43,600
ever did because now you've come up with

00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:44,680
new design elements and interfaces and

00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,990
things like that that you want to then

00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,280
reapply to stuff you did early on they

00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,690
just don't get prioritized and they

00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,060
probably never get done there's just

00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:53,710
limited time and money so having that

00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,780
holistic approach where designers feel

00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:57,640
free to say hey I came up with a better

00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:59,740
idea I want to go back and reduce some

00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:02,470
of that work earlier and instead driving

00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:04,240
it by milestones it just makes a better

00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:06,550
designer experience for a project and

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,380
that whole idea and and our

00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:11,470
implementation of it was the result of a

00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:14,170
conversation about scrum so we've

00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:15,610
created a you know very simple website

00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:19,000
right now there will eventually expand

00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:21,610
it to something a little more cohesive

00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,510
and complete but it's called consultancy

00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:27,370
scrum org and there you can will

00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:28,780
eventually win the video or whatever's

00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:30,940
put up for this we'll put that video up

00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:33,040
there but you can there's a podcast that

00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:34,720
we did with Drupal ëismí there are

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,310
previous versions of this presentation

00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,810
there and eventually we want to build a

00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:39,640
bit of a community around it and the

00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:41,710
site is up on github so anybody can

00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,360
contribute to it so there are links you

00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:45,190
want to add or content you want to add

00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,750
or whatever feel free to do it you can

00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,250
there's a little link that says you know

00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:52,539
fork me and github and you can add

00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:53,769
content to it so this is we really

00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:55,900
intend this to be a conversation into

00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:56,890
movement not necessarily like we figured

00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,230
out the way to do it and here's how to

00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:00,299
do it you're welcome because this is

00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:02,710
something that's constantly evolving

00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:04,869
what we like to say about our process

00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:06,730
internally at four kitchens is that we

00:39:04,869 --> 00:39:09,700
are an agile shop and the fact that

00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:12,430
we're agile is itself a job our process

00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,769
is agile so it can change all the time

00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:16,180
as well

00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:17,799
so you want to leave plenty of time

00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,900
because this is a big fire hose of

00:39:17,799 --> 00:39:21,640
information they want to leave plenty of

00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:25,140
time for questions for stories in group

00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:27,160
therapy so if anybody has questions

00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:29,589
there's a mic right in the center of the

00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,059
room it'd be great if you could line up

00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:33,910
and do it because they're recording this

00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:34,750
as a video or podcast or something we

00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,950
want to make sure that we hear your

00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:37,299
questions but if you have to just shout

00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:41,500
it out for whatever reason I'm happy to

00:39:37,299 --> 00:39:43,240
repeat it into the mic go ahead so it's

00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,759
like finding water in a desert really to

00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,680
see that this is being named finally I

00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:50,440
think I've been trying to do this I'm a

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:53,589
project manager run a desktop at a

00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,210
dramatic and over the last year as I've

00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:57,069
come in we've changed to this process

00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:59,740
which I've used in various forms before

00:39:57,069 --> 00:40:02,200
so this is amazing to finally put a name

00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,970
to it so thanks for that um I wanted to

00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,029
ask well I have so many questions but

00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:08,559
I'll just ask one you didn't talk a

00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:11,170
little if you could talk a little bit

00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:13,000
about the role of this scrum master in

00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,740
this context I guess that would be

00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,180
helpful if you have time I'd be

00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:18,309
interested in hearing how you deal with

00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:20,920
front-end dev like theming stories do

00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:25,480
you separate out theming stories from

00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:28,180
your dev stories so sorry the scrum

00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:31,420
master actually plays almost exactly the

00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:34,269
same role as scrum classic they you know

00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:40,170
are managing the the meeting schedule of

00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:43,119
the the recurring meetings they're also

00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:44,440
representing the team went in the scrum

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,369
practice so it's really not much

00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:50,170
different because we actually have

00:40:48,369 --> 00:40:52,089
project managers who play the role of

00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:54,609
scrum master so they manage the budget

00:40:52,089 --> 00:40:56,700
and the scrum but it's really not it's

00:40:54,609 --> 00:40:58,859
not wildly different than a regular

00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:01,230
project and and that being said there

00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:03,329
are times when we have a team member

00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:04,890
play the role of scrum master instead of

00:41:03,329 --> 00:41:07,290
the project manager just depending on

00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:10,680
various circumstances so we do it that

00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:14,460
way too sometimes and then the design

00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:16,260
stories we gosh we do it differently

00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:18,480
depending on the project sometimes we'll

00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:20,130
have tasks for design that happened

00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,170
prior to the sprint sort of the spring

00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:24,420
before the sprint and then sometimes

00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:27,780
it's just a column in our JIRA board

00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:30,480
where it goes from you know theming and

00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:32,280
back-end work I'm sorry site building

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,900
back and work then into theming so it

00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:38,820
just really depends on the team and the

00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:40,380
project that's being accomplished thanks

00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,730
so much for organizing all of this I

00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:44,099
think it's gonna be super helpful for

00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:46,200
everybody and I'm in the community I had

00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:48,060
two questions the first one is I think

00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,119
it's awesome to get the backlog in place

00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:54,329
before the project starts our challenge

00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:56,820
with that often is that it's just hard

00:41:54,329 --> 00:41:58,859
to corral the troops early on to write

00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:00,510
all the requirements and is that done in

00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:02,760
business development time or on client

00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:04,560
time and how is that organized and my

00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,089
second question is the other thing that

00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,650
we struggle with sometimes is

00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:10,079
maintaining the vision of the project

00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,819
when you're like in sprint five and the

00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,710
client sees something really exciting

00:42:11,819 --> 00:42:15,450
and shiny and wants to go there and we

00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:17,220
need to bring them back to focus on the

00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:19,349
original goal and even if we pull up you

00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:21,300
know original documents it's really hard

00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:22,170
to do that because they tend to be you

00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,000
know just something that they're not

00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:25,680
referring to later on so how do you guys

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,119
maintain the vision throughout the

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,119
project to keep everybody on course

00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:37,650
sorry we do story writing in our

00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:42,030
business development process so we write

00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:44,099
stories to estimate our project they may

00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:47,280
be really high level if we don't have a

00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:50,220
lot of time to estimate for our proposal

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:53,069
but it's great to go from the proposal

00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:54,540
into the first sprint with the stories

00:42:53,069 --> 00:42:57,930
that we thought we were going to do

00:42:54,540 --> 00:43:01,079
estimated in story points so then we

00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:03,839
know what we thought we and we we write

00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,490
a lot of assumptions so when we finally

00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,330
pull that story from the backlog and

00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:08,740
it's three months down the road

00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:11,020
our assumptions in the business process

00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:15,880
may be wrong but at least we wrote down

00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:18,160
what we assumed more for yes we do yeah

00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,530
discovery yeah yeah well I'm gonna add

00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,000
that as well but to talk about the

00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:24,970
estimation piece because there's there's

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,580
a subtlety I want to draw out there okay

00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:30,730
how many of you when you are working on

00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:34,450
a bid or a proposal for a project break

00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:35,980
down a project in terms of either very

00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:37,750
granular ly I know there's some shops

00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,370
here to do this like we think there will

00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,990
be 12 views and that each of you takes

00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:42,280
half an hour and therefore it's six

00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:43,630
hours for that now let's move on to

00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,890
every panel page and every panel page

00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:46,690
takes two hours and there four of those

00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:49,150
so that's 18 hours total there's that

00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:51,100
very granular hours mark or you kind of

00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:52,570
ballpark hours like okay this will

00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,340
feature set I don't know it's like two

00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:56,110
weeks of work so that's 80 hours how

00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,570
many people talk about hours in their

00:43:56,110 --> 00:44:00,100
proposals and their bids and all of that

00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:01,720
okay what's interesting though is

00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:04,060
because many of you are probably also

00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:06,550
scrum shop right so you develop your

00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:09,070
proposal and your bid in say the

00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:11,050
imperial system of measurement and then

00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:12,940
you win the work and now you're like

00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:14,280
okay great let's write a backlog of

00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:16,330
stories we're going to use story points

00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,400
so what happened all those hours all

00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:20,440
that time that you spent on like

00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,480
features and 40 hours and 80 hours and

00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:25,330
200 hours or three or whatever and now

00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,990
we're talking in terms of you know 1 2 3

00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:29,890
5 8 13 story points and in scrum of

00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:32,140
course you're never supposed to

00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:34,540
correlate story points to time does it

00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:37,060
make sense why are we switching from

00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:40,000
this imperial measurement of time and

00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:41,500
hours to story points when we actually

00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,780
do the work first of all we're

00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,370
duplicating all that effort and secondly

00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:47,080
those things don't align and it's just

00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:48,790
confusing the client because if we're

00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,600
talking about hours and we say yeah but

00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,650
we're not actually supposed to talk

00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,620
about hours looks like what story points

00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:55,690
and said but also hours you know it just

00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:58,180
confuses them so we do all of our

00:44:55,690 --> 00:45:01,030
estimates and bids and story points we

00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:03,190
when we escalate a project now we write

00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:06,330
stories even if they're epics we never

00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:08,710
talk about hours we do story points and

00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:10,750
we use and Susy to talk about this

00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:12,310
forever create there's there's a

00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:14,650
super-secret magic spreadsheet that

00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:15,910
she's created that is really phenomenal

00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,420
and we would love to share it with

00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:18,339
people

00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:20,589
when it's like robust enough to like

00:45:18,339 --> 00:45:22,150
really be able to share but it takes all

00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:23,740
these story points it takes historical

00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:25,059
data from all her previous projects and

00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:27,190
all of that and there's a multiplier

00:45:25,059 --> 00:45:28,990
that we use based on how difficult we

00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:30,339
think that it's the clients going to be

00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:32,980
in general and we mean that in a nice

00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:34,150
way but like some clients are doesn't

00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,619
have a lot of overhead that you have to

00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:36,970
deal with and some are super fast and

00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:38,829
they make decisions quickly and like

00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:42,849
you're turning away and some take weeks

00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:45,099
to decide things so we can assign some

00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:46,990
kind of a multiplier and we know it or

00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:48,640
burn is because they're going to be four

00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:49,630
or five people on the team and they're

00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,039
going to be billing this is when we

00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:52,480
start to talk about time because we

00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,799
consider like full-time equivalent

00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,809
part-time equivalent that's what we

00:45:53,799 --> 00:45:57,609
calculate cost of the project so we're

00:45:55,809 --> 00:46:01,420
never thinking about like features and

00:45:57,609 --> 00:46:03,609
hours it's always features story points

00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:05,650
we total up all the story points and

00:46:03,609 --> 00:46:06,880
then we have a conversion tool based on

00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:09,460
historical data in our own experience

00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,220
additionally we will write a few stuff

00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:13,990
we don't know stories and it's been a

00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:16,119
little controversial some clients are

00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:17,619
worried that that means that we're

00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:19,750
padding the estimate but we're trying to

00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:22,509
be very transparent that it's not stuff

00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:24,730
we don't know it's stuff you don't know

00:46:22,509 --> 00:46:26,559
and you're gonna figure out and want and

00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:29,380
need as we go along so here's your

00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,970
bucket so procurement doesn't love that

00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:33,269
but everybody else does and and that

00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:36,039
kind of goes towards your second

00:46:33,269 --> 00:46:40,299
question which was how do you keep that

00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:41,349
broad vision right and these things are

00:46:40,299 --> 00:46:42,789
gonna come up and they're gonna see the

00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:44,890
shiny thing and say ooh I want more of

00:46:42,789 --> 00:46:46,630
this and what were that and that's where

00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:48,430
this ready sized backlog at the

00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:50,529
beginning comes into play if you have a

00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:52,809
ready sized backlog and you know that

00:46:50,529 --> 00:46:56,410
this project is going to be a total of a

00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:59,349
hundred story points and they say oh but

00:46:56,410 --> 00:47:00,910
I want this this and this and you go and

00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:02,589
you estimate these new features that

00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:05,140
they've requested and you say well

00:47:02,589 --> 00:47:07,529
that's 30 story points so the original

00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:10,630
plan was to do a hundred points of work

00:47:07,529 --> 00:47:11,920
now you want 30 extra story points okay

00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:13,240
so we're gonna put that in here so now

00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,240
we've got a hundred and thirty story

00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:19,240
points to do what do we lose now we need

00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,819
to lose 30 story points so when they see

00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,410
something bright and shiny you say great

00:47:21,819 --> 00:47:25,150
here's all these other shiny things

00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:27,579
you're gonna have to give some of those

00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:29,039
back and that allows you to focus the

00:47:27,579 --> 00:47:32,819
conversation and on what is

00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:34,739
true MVP what meets their needs we've

00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:37,529
also gone back and said this doesn't

00:47:34,739 --> 00:47:38,999
meet your vision remember you said you

00:47:37,529 --> 00:47:41,099
know your main business with driver was

00:47:38,999 --> 00:47:44,309
X well now you're actually going against

00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:47,160
that and then sometimes they say oh I

00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:49,410
forgot I got distracted

00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:53,339
so sometimes us being the vision holder

00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:55,739
helps them keep on track because you

00:47:53,339 --> 00:47:57,329
know it's a long process and and

00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:58,529
sometimes they make that conscious

00:47:57,329 --> 00:48:00,599
decision but at least they have the

00:47:58,529 --> 00:48:03,119
information to make it as a conscious

00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:04,799
decision yes we want to spend more money

00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,269
to get this or we want to drop these

00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:08,880
other features to get this where we want

00:48:06,269 --> 00:48:11,910
to add time whatever the circumstances

00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,019
may be I apologize to keep you waiting

00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:15,449
there's one more thing I want to add

00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:16,709
because you mentioned discovery and then

00:48:15,449 --> 00:48:19,160
we're talking about vision and all of

00:48:16,709 --> 00:48:21,650
that it's really important to have an

00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:24,239
excellent discovery process and

00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:26,489
discovery should do a lot of things but

00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:28,549
at a bare minimum you need to outline

00:48:26,489 --> 00:48:31,109
precisely what the project's goals are

00:48:28,549 --> 00:48:32,729
they're the goals that the client has as

00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:34,589
an organization the goals that the

00:48:32,729 --> 00:48:36,239
project has in terms of delivery and

00:48:34,589 --> 00:48:38,669
what problem is trying to solve the

00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:40,650
goals of the individual clients some

00:48:38,669 --> 00:48:42,239
people as Suzy mentioned earlier they're

00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:43,769
going to be fired if this doesn't go

00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:46,319
well we need to know that as a vendor

00:48:43,769 --> 00:48:47,849
right additionally you as a vendor as a

00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,809
consultant you have goals there are

00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:50,640
things you want to get out of this

00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:52,409
project other than just paying the bills

00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,549
right you want something cool than

00:48:52,409 --> 00:48:55,169
having your portfolio you want to

00:48:53,549 --> 00:48:56,489
experiment with new technology you want

00:48:55,169 --> 00:48:57,779
to help train their team you want to

00:48:56,489 --> 00:48:59,459
build a lifelong relationship there all

00:48:57,779 --> 00:49:02,189
these things you want to do lay those

00:48:59,459 --> 00:49:04,979
goals out on the table better yet put

00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:08,069
them on your project wiki review them at

00:49:04,979 --> 00:49:10,019
the demos and at the retros if you have

00:49:08,069 --> 00:49:11,999
a physical office write them on one of

00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:13,739
those big Diesel post-its and put it on

00:49:11,999 --> 00:49:15,839
the wall about the team and look at it

00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:18,419
every day like any time you have a

00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:20,369
question should we do a or B look at the

00:49:18,419 --> 00:49:21,929
goals that's one of the ways that you

00:49:20,369 --> 00:49:23,069
can keep that vision in mind first of

00:49:21,929 --> 00:49:24,630
all you have to have a clearly

00:49:23,069 --> 00:49:27,419
articulated vision of the beginning and

00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:29,279
constantly revisit and having an

00:49:27,419 --> 00:49:31,439
excellent discovery process I think is

00:49:29,279 --> 00:49:34,439
part of the key I remember a client who

00:49:31,439 --> 00:49:36,390
came in and on the second day of the

00:49:34,439 --> 00:49:38,759
discovery process they said you know I

00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:41,040
came in yesterday and I saw the post-it

00:49:38,759 --> 00:49:43,020
notes and the big whiteboard

00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,060
the big white page that you can flip

00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:46,470
over and the whiteboard and all and I

00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:49,650
was like oh my god here we go again

00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:51,119
these are the worst and your process has

00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:53,160
been great and we love it and we're

00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,320
getting a lot out of it and so having

00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,390
something that isn't just generic

00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:59,369
discovery but where you've really put

00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:00,990
some time into developing what that

00:49:59,369 --> 00:50:03,000
process is and one of the most useful

00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:16,650
tools and iterating on that just like

00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:19,350
being agile thank you I'm sorry I like

00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:20,970
the focus on product owner or project

00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:23,010
owner as an important role we've kind of

00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:24,750
identified the same I think a key

00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:28,350
difference for us is we've almost always

00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:29,670
wanted that to be on the client side to

00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:32,190
the point where we're writing it into

00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:35,670
contracts who that person is and what

00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:37,230
their role requires of them I'm kind of

00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:38,609
curious from your perspective along

00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:39,780
those lines it's almost more of us we're

00:50:38,609 --> 00:50:40,140
not in our heads really that's a good

00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:43,440
idea

00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:44,940
okay so from a sales perspective what

00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,400
are some of the things you look for as

00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:50,490
red flags or major concerns or big

00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:52,080
positives when identifying new clients

00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:54,390
and who's gonna be healthy for an agile

00:50:52,080 --> 00:51:00,630
project so if you sit down and you say

00:50:54,390 --> 00:51:03,210
to them ten hours a week all you say is

00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:05,640
I need 10 hours of your time a week and

00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:08,190
they like freak out then they're not

00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:10,160
going to be a good product owner because

00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:13,530
that's about the average of what we need

00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:15,990
and and I think that number really sort

00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:18,720
of separates the wheat from the chaff

00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:20,310
because they say like the reason I hired

00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,490
you is because I don't even have 10

00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:26,940
hours a week and then but but as you

00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:30,180
seen from our outline even if we do the

00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:34,140
product owner role they're still the

00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:36,980
approving stakeholder which is five

00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:40,200
hours a week it's still not nothing so

00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:42,030
so it's I think the thing that we've

00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:44,550
seen a lot is that we ask people to

00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:46,530
basically take on a new profession by

00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:47,880
being a product owner there are people

00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:50,100
who go to school for being a product

00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,690
owner they go to conferences and the

00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,560
whole nine yards to learn how to manage

00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:54,540
a product

00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:56,580
but we asked them to take on this new

00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:58,680
profession for this project and it's

00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:00,900
hard it's hard work and it's difficult

00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:03,000
and understanding thin vertical slices

00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:05,070
and all that is probably one of the most

00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:09,150
difficult things we see on their side so

00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:10,680
we actually spend a lot of time and you

00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:12,630
know I was on one project that took 11

00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:16,530
months and when we got to the end we

00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:19,050
said now you're a product owner but we

00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:21,000
were done so um but that was it was

00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:23,130
still good so she's in our support

00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,660
process now and so she's a great client

00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:27,750
to deal with because she knows exactly

00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:29,910
how to slice it and define it and and be

00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:31,980
good about you know writing user story

00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:34,080
and all that good stuff so it's it's

00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:36,660
hard work to get someone to learn how to

00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:38,100
be a product owner and also this person

00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:39,480
has to be empowered they have to

00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:41,310
actually be able to make decisions and

00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,690
one way to try and figure that out you

00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:45,600
can try just asking that and they'll say

00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:48,690
sure yeah I'm in charge of this ask them

00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:51,960
who do you have to ask for approval and

00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:53,670
if they mention anybody else then that

00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,430
means that like well they're they don't

00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:58,560
really have all the power right now

00:52:56,430 --> 00:53:00,360
every organization you got to run it up

00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:02,640
the ladder at some point right that's

00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,810
normal but if that list is long or if

00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,250
there are all kinds of like well there's

00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:06,600
my manager and then like the super

00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:08,460
manager and then the ultra manager and

00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:11,340
then the VP if there are all these

00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:14,010
chains of approval or whatever it's

00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:15,030
gonna be really hard to either yourself

00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:16,530
be empowered because you're gonna have

00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:18,620
to go through them or for that person to

00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:20,880
be empowered in a situation like that

00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:22,290
you may want to seriously consider

00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,520
whether that's the right fit for your

00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:27,000
organization because it's gonna be hard

00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:29,340
to do strong within period yes sir

00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,920
so we've adopted similar processes over

00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:34,980
the last 18 to 24 months the biggest

00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:38,070
challenge for us has been from sales and

00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:39,510
billing perspective I feel like our

00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:41,940
clients feel like they shoulder all the

00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:43,440
risk with this process how do you guys

00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:46,170
deal with that do you bill in Sprint's

00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,620
is it still a hard bid at the end but

00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:50,940
then you know it's gonna be X dollar

00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:53,130
fifty thousand two hundred and fifty six

00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:55,920
dollars and eight cents or like we're

00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:57,630
building in 20k every two weeks and it

00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,260
seems to make our clients feel like

00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:00,940
they're shouldering all the load

00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:02,830
it's a tough sell how do you guys deal

00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:04,570
with that they're shouldering because

00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:06,190
they're not getting what they expected

00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:09,700
what do you mean by shouldering the risk

00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:11,740
the risk of I'm going to pay you for

00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:13,510
some services but you know the bike

00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:15,040
analogy that you used of it's not done

00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:17,080
until it's done and this iterative

00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:19,359
process is sort of difficult for them to

00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:21,400
grab and that's my interpretation of is

00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:23,950
that it feels like the clients are

00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:26,800
shouldering the risk and is that is

00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:29,800
there so the real question is how do you

00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:34,300
guys build is it a buy sprint or is it

00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:35,770
again just one contract lump sum so I do

00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:40,510
a lot of sales at poor kitchens so I'll

00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:41,619
tell you what I do there are shops

00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:43,900
handle this in different ways

00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:45,369
I know shops that bill on a weekly basis

00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,690
or a sprint Li basis so there's a lump

00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:51,040
sum you want us or another sprint that's

00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:52,690
another $20,000 we don't do that I've

00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,940
heard of some shops that just do

00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:57,550
everything flat fee and then they need

00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:59,500
to figure it out themselves you know

00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:02,050
we've agreed to do this work for $15,000

00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:03,670
we just got to make it work that's one

00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:04,930
way to do it that's not how we work none

00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:08,680
of these are wrong it's just not how we

00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:12,280
do it we treat the budget as a cap and

00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,970
we work towards that it's really

00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,619
important to have a thorough

00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:16,960
understanding of the project in advance

00:55:14,619 --> 00:55:18,609
and that's partly helped by having a

00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,290
really excellent discovery pocket

00:55:18,609 --> 00:55:21,760
process and it's really helped by having

00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:24,400
that discovery process be a separate

00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,200
engagement early on if it's a separate

00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,520
engagement early on and you come up with

00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,230
a project plan and you know what you're

00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,000
gonna do and as part of the deliverables

00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:34,000
that you are being paid to deliver is

00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,310
the fully sized backlog of stories you

00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,350
can then very accurately estimate the

00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:40,119
cost of that project as part of the

00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:41,170
discovery process then you can go to

00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:42,490
them with the money and you can have

00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:43,600
that tough conversation about like okay

00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:45,040
here are the things you said you want to

00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,540
do and I look up all the goals you said

00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,800
you wanted to achieve here's how much we

00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:49,660
think it's actually going to cost and

00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:51,100
then we can start to filter through that

00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:52,510
backlog during more of like a second

00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,470
business development phase to figure out

00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:55,060
what we're actually going to do with

00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:57,040
that work plus at that point you've

00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:58,630
you've created a relationship and you've

00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,070
created trust with them so they know

00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:01,600
that you're not trying to just you know

00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:02,710
built them for cash you're actually

00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,420
trying to do really good work and

00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:07,109
they're much more willing to discuss the

00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:08,609
logistics of budgeting and and scope and

00:56:07,109 --> 00:56:10,079
like that with you because they know

00:56:08,609 --> 00:56:11,460
that you're not around to take advantage

00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,470
of them a lot of people think that every

00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:14,670
consultancy is like a mechanic because

00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:16,829
like you speak this magical language

00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:18,359
you're like oh you know your try Furby

00:56:16,829 --> 00:56:20,190
gating agitators busted or it's gonna

00:56:18,359 --> 00:56:22,319
take a thousand dollars to replace like

00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:24,119
sure okay you know no we're not

00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:29,279
dishonest people you know we're trying

00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:31,559
to do good work so we work against no

00:56:29,279 --> 00:56:33,329
having a fully sized backlog we know

00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:34,980
that if we did ten story points in

00:56:33,329 --> 00:56:38,099
sprint one and there are nine remaining

00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:39,989
then we can do 100 story points but if

00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:42,089
they're 200 in the backlog that budget

00:56:39,989 --> 00:56:43,619
is going to go over by 100 percent so

00:56:42,089 --> 00:56:45,869
there's actually two pieces of the

00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:48,839
budget you have to watch there's the

00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:50,880
butts in seats time so if this person

00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:53,940
comes to work every day for the next ten

00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:56,609
weeks and you bill X number of hours a

00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:58,019
week that's one budget and then you have

00:56:56,609 --> 00:56:59,880
this is how many stories we have in the

00:56:58,019 --> 00:57:01,739
backlog this is how many Sprint's we

00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,989
have to do it this is our velocity and

00:57:01,739 --> 00:57:06,329
so you have to constantly balance these

00:57:03,989 --> 00:57:08,730
two to make sure that you've got enough

00:57:06,329 --> 00:57:10,589
people to spend the money purply oh

00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:12,180
somebody goes on vacation oh now we've

00:57:10,589 --> 00:57:14,999
got another week that we can you know

00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:16,739
add another sprint okay but we have

00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:18,509
twice as many stories in the backlog

00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:21,809
that we need so there's constantly the

00:57:18,509 --> 00:57:23,400
balance of the the our burn because

00:57:21,809 --> 00:57:25,319
we're all timing materials so when we

00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,660
were talking about overtime that was our

00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:30,089
experience that if you work the weekend

00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:32,400
then you've basically like borrowed from

00:57:30,089 --> 00:57:34,980
a future sprint but at the same time

00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,700
you're burning down stories so how do

00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:40,829
you keep those two buckets meanings

00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:43,859
meaningful and equal it's hard it's a

00:57:40,829 --> 00:57:45,239
lot of work also update your client at

00:57:43,859 --> 00:57:46,470
the end of every sprint yeah here's how

00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:48,329
much here's what we burned here's how

00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:50,759
much you have left no surprises right

00:57:48,329 --> 00:57:51,960
also do it right after the demo in a

00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:54,839
summer conversation so they know the

00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:57,029
value they got and that's MVP - I mean

00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:58,769
you can say like here's what you're

00:57:57,029 --> 00:58:01,259
going to get for the MVP everybody work

00:57:58,769 --> 00:58:03,269
towards that and then let's work on that

00:58:01,259 --> 00:58:05,819
on phase one or you know faith two or

00:58:03,269 --> 00:58:08,009
whatever you want to call it don't call

00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:10,680
them releases they hate that or alpha

00:58:08,009 --> 00:58:16,019
they don't understand that feh so we

00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:17,890
just call it milestone one yes sir hi so

00:58:16,019 --> 00:58:19,870
I'm an account management role

00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:21,730
Echidna and you know we're fortunate

00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:24,070
have a lot of really great clients but

00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:27,580
we do have some clients that are driven

00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:29,320
by board decisions and despite you know

00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:30,940
having very similar processes we call

00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:33,310
them project champions because it makes

00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:34,420
them feel a little more empowered but at

00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:36,130
the start of it when you're in the

00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:37,600
honeymoon phase they agree to all of

00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:39,820
your conditions and they're like yes

00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:42,220
this will be this way and I often find

00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:45,520
sometimes as you get into the longer

00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:46,900
projects that sometimes they they have

00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:51,430
to start going to the board for more

00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:55,420
decisions and it kind of degrades how

00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:57,940
I'm curious what are the consequences if

00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:59,620
you find that happens in a situation as

00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:00,970
an account manager you tend to want to

00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,770
try to smooth things over and keep

00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:04,870
things moving and and keep a strong

00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:09,760
client relationship and you don't want

00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:12,100
any anything to seem punitive or you

00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,260
know spiteful in the consequence I'm

00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:16,540
wondering if that type of situation

00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:18,490
arises at your organization what do you

00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:21,580
do to try to either get it on track or

00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:24,880
or how does it impact your projects so I

00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:27,100
really like math I really like to show

00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,370
people like your our velocity is

00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:33,640
directly impacted by your ability to

00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:37,540
make decisions so first print we did 20

00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:39,820
points it's print 12 we did 10 because

00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:42,790
it took you know at 3 times as long for

00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:45,040
you to get there so so you actually

00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:47,440
would so you just say Matt it's like I

00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:49,540
if I took this velocity we would have

00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,610
gotten here but now we're here so what

00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:54,310
do you want to do about right Matt Matt

00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:55,240
nice fact math is not you know emotional

00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:56,770
it doesn't have that connotation

00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:59,350
absolutely at the end of the day though

00:59:56,770 --> 01:00:01,210
is often very fixed right yeah it's and

00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:02,650
they you know they can be one two

01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:04,780
hundred thousand dollar projects that

01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:07,180
mean a lot to the organization's sure

01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:09,250
learning and also I think transparency

01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:12,430
is a big part of it the fact that they

01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:15,370
are involved at every step and they have

01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:16,510
been part of that process you know there

01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:17,890
are definitely those times at the end of

01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:20,140
the project where it's like well we have

01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:21,040
gone a little bit over here why did you

01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:23,560
let us do that

01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:26,620
right we all kind of went there together

01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:28,570
so let's talk about ways and then we

01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:30,870
have a you know a frank discussion about

01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:34,650
like what are our options

01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:36,420
and I mean we've had a client where we

01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:40,500
gave an estimate and it was a fixed bid

01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:41,820
and the project was clearly going to go

01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,590
way over budget because of some

01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:46,260
additional complexities that hadn't been

01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:48,030
uncovered and we had to sit down with

01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:50,370
them and say like here are some options

01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:51,990
and one of those options was we walk

01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:53,550
away you don't pay us you take

01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:55,860
everything that we've done so far and

01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:57,900
one of those options was we just keep

01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:59,790
going and we take some of those costs on

01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:01,770
for ourselves and then there were some

01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:03,270
you know options in the middle and we

01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:06,270
sat down and have a conversation and we

01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:07,980
came to a decision together and we moved

01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:12,060
on and the nice thing about that was the

01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:13,890
client was super happy about all of the

01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:16,320
basically the way that we handled it

01:01:13,890 --> 01:01:17,550
that now they're doing a support

01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,960
agreement with us and we're talking

01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:20,130
about you know what's our next project

01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,280
going to be together and they were super

01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:25,530
happy to settle for less because we said

01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:29,100
we want to do the right thing but we

01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:32,010
only have this much to work with so help

01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:34,530
us figure out how much you're gonna eat

01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:36,150
yeah I mean this is a business really

01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:38,640
how we tend to be very transparent yeah

01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:40,110
like that totally helps and you know and

01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:42,120
just the frame it is and I'm so I do

01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:44,670
account management too so I would I

01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:45,960
would be very sensitive to how you know

01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:47,760
we're not trying to get out of anything

01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:49,560
and we're not trying to cheat you and

01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,240
we're not to make you feel bad but here

01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,530
are just the facts and we just need to

01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:55,290
be real about them and let's have an

01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:57,000
adult conversation about it what I would

01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:58,800
do in your case we need to have a board

01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,960
or like sometimes we call that like the

01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:02,130
the voice in the shadows who emerges

01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,450
towards the end of a project and

01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:05,280
suddenly like wait what's happening

01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:08,880
nobody talked to me about this you know

01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:11,130
health care yeah yeah so in those cases

01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,930
like if it's a consistent pattern of the

01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:14,700
board coming in and wanting to ship all

01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:17,130
of that stuff I would ask to speak to

01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:18,420
the board directly you know go if it's a

01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:21,390
big enough project fly out there go to a

01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:23,400
board meeting and and just explain like

01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:24,570
okay I am I'm here to represent the

01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,980
organization that you've hired to do all

01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:27,690
of this we've been doing this for years

01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:29,190
we've seen things like this happen

01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:30,840
before here's what's going to happen if

01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:33,000
you continue to do this we know you're

01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:35,610
not trying to run anything off the rails

01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,320
but it is our professional duty to tell

01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:39,160
you that what you're doing is silly and

01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:41,500
that you you need

01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:42,790
to buckle down and like just figure out

01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,140
what you're gonna do and let's consider

01:02:42,790 --> 01:02:46,720
all that other stuff maybe a different

01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:50,200
phase of work okay sure

01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:53,890
alright last question I'm way too short

01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:55,420
for this microphone I'm curious about

01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:57,160
retrospective so you talked a little bit

01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:58,120
about demos and reviews and I know that

01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:00,160
you know Sprint is very much an

01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:02,800
iterative process not just on the work

01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:04,120
but on the process and Cindy can you

01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,500
talk about how often you're having

01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:07,150
retrospectives how long your Sprint's

01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:09,130
are and kind of how you're building that

01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:11,710
process in that's that's a great

01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:13,690
question and we need to add that slide

01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:16,030
we do because we didn't talk about that

01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:19,630
at all we do a retro at the end of each

01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:22,330
sprint we do a sprint Li retro we

01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:25,360
usually do a project retro and if

01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:27,580
there's something going on you know

01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:30,400
that's a little bit hinky then we can do

01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:33,070
a retro at any time milestone retros are

01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:34,960
actually really helpful too because they

01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:37,390
go back to that original question about

01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,980
vision and goals and that's where you

01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:41,290
can really sort of say like okay we've

01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:43,690
been doing this for three months now are

01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:45,520
we still on track to the original goal

01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:47,380
do we need to adjust the goals at this

01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:49,770
point so those write your Richards are

01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:53,710
really actually a good thing to add so

01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:55,630
enter sprints of two weeks do it alright

01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:57,090
thank you so very much you can rate the

01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:59,320
section here and download the slides

01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:59,910
