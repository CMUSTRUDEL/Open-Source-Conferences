	Speakers: scott.bellkmolltannergMatt Miritello
Time Inc. has made a tremendous investment in Drupal. Over the last 18 months, they have created a Drupal Center of Excellence, hired Drupal experts and consultants and trained many of their in house developers to work in Drupal. They have developed a large infrastructure around managing editorial Drupal sites and integrated Drupal into their legacy systems. They have built a world class editorial tool for managing online publishing with Drupal.

In 2014 Time Inc. plans to move all of their 24 magazine titles to the Drupal platform they have built. This presentation will give attendees insight into the process of how Time Inc. came to the decision to use Drupal, how they put a training program and governance model in place to integrate Drupal into the organization and what technical challenges were overcome in the process.

Also, this presentation will give the audience an under the hood view of the tools and processes put in place to help Time Inc. move it's very large online publishing business to the Drupal platform.

This presentation will be in a panel format and will be lead by Matt Miritello, Technical Director at Time Inc. He will be joined by some of the key technical people that worked with Time Inc on this project including Scott Bell, Kevin Moll and Tanner Dorheim who served as Technical Consultants on the project.
