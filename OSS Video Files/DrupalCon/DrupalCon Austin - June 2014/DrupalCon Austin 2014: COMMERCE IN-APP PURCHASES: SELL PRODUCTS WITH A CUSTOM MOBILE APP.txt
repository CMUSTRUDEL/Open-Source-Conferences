Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: COMMERCE IN-APP PURCHASES: SELL PRODUCTS WITH A CUSTOM MOBILE APP
Publication date: 2014-06-04
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: scotthookertyler.frankenstein

Traditional commerce is dead! Maybe that is a bit too dramatic, but purchases made "In-App" have skyrocketed within the last year.

Come to this session to learn how to bring the massively expanding market of In-App purchases to your business. In this session we will show you how to leverage this route to market, with a Drupal Commerce site.

This session is great for business owners and site builders alike. Business owners can ascertain if an E-commerce site with In-App purchases is a worthwhile investment. While site builders can see that with relatively little effort, In-App purchasing can be implemented.

With "What's App" being sold recently for billions of dollars, with their only revenue stream being a $1.00 In-App purchase, it certainly makes sense to see what you could be missing out on.

Let us show you the future!

okay so first we wanted to talk about a

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,810
few of the tool sets involved in making

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,670
all this happen of course everybody in

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,090
here has probably at least one if not

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,830
dozens or so of drupal websites so we

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,350
all know a drupe out of the box provides

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:20,400
us with websites for our desktops and

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,820
our laptops of course in the last five

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,260
to seven years or so with the advent of

00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,840
smartphones and stuff we really have to

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,599
concentrate on providing our websites

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,520
for for other devices as well so of

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,020
course that's where our mobile websites

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,790
come in with our responsive designs and

00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,160
with responsive designs can get a little

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,690
tricky with all the the numerous amounts

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,660
of devices out there especially from the

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,789
Android perspective and all the

00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:50,520
resolutions available in the different

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:53,100
breakpoints where our our websites need

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,129
to start responding to those those sizes

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,449
and reorganizing our content to make

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:02,609
them more accessible from every device

00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:06,540
so then of course as well it's a it's a

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:08,930
good idea to expose our our businesses

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,720
and our products or our services as

00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:15,720
mobile apps as well because you know our

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,490
mobile phones have features that not

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,590
necessarily our desktop or laptops are

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,950
going to have such as our camera

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,869
geolocation push notifications and then

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,299
of course the app stores which are

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,430
growing tremendously in popularity and

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,479
there are millions and millions of

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,770
people downloading apps all the time so

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,650
with some of these technologies now we

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:42,689
can more easily expose our Drupal

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:44,640
websites to the mobile app world so I

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:47,159
think in that apple keynote yesterday

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,710
they said something the 75th billionth

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,020
app was downloaded it might be the seven

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,000
hundred and fiftieth billionth app and

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,570
it's quite a margin forever there but it

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,909
was one or the other so if you're an

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,770
e-commerce store it makes sense for you

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,899
to have your application on one of these

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:09,119
app stores even because there's just

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:12,060
such a big market to tap into and so

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,380
before we get into how you build the

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,490
mobile app using the

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,740
lunges we've built we're just going to

00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:19,200
give you a quick overview of some of the

00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,610
technologies we're using so I obviously

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,470
Drupal's there and it's all the modules

00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:27,030
we love so entities views bulls and

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,890
drupal commerce leverages all of them in

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,990
very interesting ways so we use rules

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:34,050
for pricing and all sorts of stuff in

00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:36,930
between and for the purposes of making

00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:39,840
this demonstration and making it easier

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,550
for you guys to build apps we've kind of

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,260
built the commerce stuff on top of

00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,360
drupal commerce kickstart which if you

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,820
quick show of hands if you've heard of

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,640
kickstart install kick start this is so

00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,260
easy the best audience ever so kick

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,670
start don't need to tell you about it's

00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,490
a Drupal installation profile and

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:59,280
everything's bundled in we've forked it

00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:04,950
and added some modules into it which we

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,960
rely on for drupal gap so with drupal

00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,120
gap if anybody's not familiar it's an

00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:13,970
open-source mobile application

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,950
development kit for drupal websites and

00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:19,410
so essentially it utilizes a lot of the

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:23,760
same concepts that we drupal developers

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:26,490
are familiar with so it's the learning

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,250
curve is not very steep if you have

00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:33,090
experience developing Drupal modules and

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:35,910
ripple themes and such so so to actually

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,510
build a mobile app we need we need a way

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,940
to get the data from our Drupal website

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:50,520
and that's where drupal services comes

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:54,000
into play and that is a contributing or

00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:57,900
our users or comments files taxonomy

00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,450
vocabularies and terms as json primarily

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,840
but there's other formats that you can

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:05,940
consume as well like XML if you need it

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:09,150
so utilizing those those things were

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:12,740
able to to consume all of our Drupal

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:17,790
resources in in different environments

00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:21,330
and so the clues in the name so drupal

00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,850
gap is specifically at the moment built

00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:26,130
for phonegap and if you haven't heard a

00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,010
phonegap it's now owned by Adobe it's

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,720
still open

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,460
source so it has some big players behind

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,920
it and there's some big big apps being

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,630
built on it and I was when I was trying

00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,030
to work out how I wanted to build my up

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,430
I didn't really want to start learning

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,930
objective-c and then I didn't really

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,900
want to start playing with Java and I

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:47,050
thought well HTML and CSS or kind of

00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,780
know that so phonegap kind of lets me do

00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:52,150
mobile apps really easily and again in

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,920
the apple keynote yesterday or yesterday

00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,920
they've announced a new programming

00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:01,330
language called Swift and I don't want

00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:04,390
to learn that so yeah I stick with PHP

00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:08,400
yet check stick with HTML check and CSS

00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:11,500
so that's why we kind of like PhoneGap

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,930
and of course we all are very familiar

00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,150
with jquery it comes packaged rate with

00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,400
Drupal so we've used that a lot for our

00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:21,610
front-end stuff and user interface stuff

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,040
so the folks over a jquery also came off

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:28,690
with another awesome product and that is

00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:32,530
jquery mobile and so that lets us take

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:35,200
our simple HTML and apply it to some

00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:37,780
some attributes to it and jQuery Mobile

00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,980
will go ahead and take our simple HTML

00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:45,250
and convert it into you know nice big

00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:48,250
button size things for our thumbs and

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:50,350
everything at our mobile devices so it

00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,930
takes a tremendous amount of the work

00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:57,190
out of it for us and just lets us

00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:59,680
concentrate on just focusing on building

00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,590
our our pages out and they take care of

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,430
a lot of the design for us so it's very

00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:09,130
familiar to iOS and Android users in the

00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:13,000
way that it styles a lot of the the

00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:17,890
buttons and elements for us just a

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,610
question yeah should we turn it on all

00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,610
shout out in the muck

00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:49,020
that would be helpful yeah we will the

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,199
presentation will answer all of those

00:06:49,020 --> 00:07:05,789
questions in about four slides worth of

00:06:52,199 --> 00:07:09,210
time yeah this you're in the right

00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:12,330
session and just one quick word on

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:16,649
jQuery Mobile is so some version 1.4

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:17,969
point one or two now I think there's a

00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:19,800
lot of criticisms that it's not very

00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:21,959
performant for phonegap there's a lot of

00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,809
other frameworks you can build on but so

00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:27,120
1.3 was not so good the performance at a

00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:29,789
1.4 is kind of getting towards being as

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,439
good as native so there is some

00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:34,110
drawbacks of using this kind of the

00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:41,249
frameworks but generally 1.4 Jacob

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:44,039
morale is good ok so I'll kind of go

00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:46,860
over a lot of what Drupal gap does for

00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:49,800
us and a lot of the the work that it

00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,110
does for us to simplify our lives so as

00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,629
I was saying earlier it utilizes a lot

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,930
of concepts that us Drupal developers

00:07:54,629 --> 00:08:01,050
are already familiar with and the whole

00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,360
idea is instead of writing PHP to do all

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:06,330
this we're just going to be using

00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,709
javascript so out of the box when we're

00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,459
getting started as we're all familiar

00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:14,159
with our Drupal site we grab a copy of

00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:16,979
default settings PHP and rename it as

00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:18,899
settings dot PHP so again in this

00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,399
environment it's very very similar we'll

00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:24,779
just grab a copy of our default settings

00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:26,580
j/s rename it as settings jazz and the

00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:28,889
only thing we really need to do to get

00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:34,900
started is in that settings file just

00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:36,820
give the URL to our Drupal website so

00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,860
so of course on our Drupal site we have

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:42,000
all kinds of different entities out of

00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:45,520
the box Drupal comes with nodes users

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,330
comments taxonomy terms and vocabularies

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:52,870
files but don't think I'm forgetting any

00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:55,120
there so obviously we we want that stuff

00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:58,210
in our app we need to need to display

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,770
our knowns or comments or with of course

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,600
the commerce module comes with all

00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:04,540
different types of entities and when it

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,750
comes time to to sell stuff some stuff

00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:11,440
as in-app purchases we need access to to

00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:13,870
all those entities so with with the

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,080
services module it provides a crud

00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:19,540
interface and that is a CR UD in that

00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,230
stands for create retrieve update and

00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:25,390
delete so that provides us with a way to

00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:28,210
to create new content to retrieve

00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:32,070
existing content to update existing

00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:35,050
content and or delete existing content

00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:37,410
so once we start building out our our

00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:40,960
content types and fielding them or

00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,880
utilizing commerce kickstart or building

00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,820
our own custom products and product

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,590
displays it comes time to to display all

00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,990
that stuff and of course everybody knows

00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:53,260
views and how awesome and powerful it is

00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:56,830
so we we definitely need a way to to

00:09:53,260 --> 00:10:00,360
utilize views and to consume some of our

00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:03,910
views in our app so one of the

00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,640
dependencies of Drupal gap is the views

00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:10,900
data source module and what that allows

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:14,200
us to do is when we're building our

00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,760
views we can then the the result sets

00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,940
they've used normally spitting out as

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,310
HTML for us it will spit out JSON for us

00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:24,280
so we can consume those and and work

00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:27,160
with those in a a mobile app environment

00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:29,980
so that covers a lot of the core stuff

00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,230
that we need as drupal developers to to

00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:35,260
grab our entities to work with them and

00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:38,830
then to utilize views to to display them

00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:41,290
and query them and use our arguments to

00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:47,050
to filter them for whatever environment

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:48,790
we're working with so then when when we

00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:51,280
first all started using Drupal

00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,330
you know when we're when we're doing our

00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,710
site building stuff through

00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:56,140
point-and-click we can do it a

00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:58,090
tremendous amount of stuff just by

00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,970
pointing and clicking without ever

00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:02,620
having to write a line of code but

00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,780
eventually we almost always have to

00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,910
write a custom module to get in there

00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,490
and and customize some things to work

00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:13,390
with what we're trying to do with our

00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:16,360
project so again drupal gap utilizes the

00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:20,290
same idea as drupal where you can create

00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:22,720
custom modules for it so when you create

00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:25,150
a custom module in drupal gap it also

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,450
utilizes a lot of the the same hooks

00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:30,370
that Drupal uses so again instead of

00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:33,370
just writing PHP we're going to be

00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:36,220
writing JavaScript to to take advantage

00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:40,720
of all this all these hooks for making

00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:44,380
our pages or blocks menus etc I'll touch

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,240
on that in a moment but first we'll talk

00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:49,330
a little bit about the presentation

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,890
layer that Drupal gap utilizes and again

00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:53,080
we're always we're always following the

00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:55,920
same concepts that Drupal uses here so

00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:59,470
with Drupal gap we have the idea of

00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:05,050
themes so we're separating our our

00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:07,150
display from our content so so if if

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:10,210
need be we can totally redesign our

00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:12,250
mobile apps just like we can our website

00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:14,170
and we don't have to worry about our

00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,700
content because that all it all lives

00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:19,540
separately and of course it lives in

00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:22,120
Drupal so so once we once we have a

00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:26,230
theme assembled as we know as developers

00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:28,840
themes have regions and I mean a very

00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:32,020
basic mobile app probably at minimum has

00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:33,550
a top region for your like your home

00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,250
button or your back button if you're on

00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,680
Android and maybe a title area then you

00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,410
have your big region typically in the

00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,180
middle to display your content and maybe

00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:46,350
some forms to work with stuff like that

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:48,700
and then a footer region maybe for some

00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:51,520
info buttons or some help buttons and

00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,560
stuff like that so once we have our our

00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,470
theme established and we have our

00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:59,940
region's set up then as we know we can

00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:01,970
place blocks inside of these regions and

00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:05,089
again we can

00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:07,279
creates custom blocks in drupal gap and

00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:10,579
it comes packaged with a lot of blocks

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:14,360
that were or very familiar with like the

00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:17,209
user login login block or some comment

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:20,060
blocks and stuff like that so and even

00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:22,550
the idea of like hook block info or hook

00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:25,100
block view all that stuff is is packaged

00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:27,589
in there for you to just utilize those

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:32,629
exact same PHP techniques but it's just

00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:33,920
in JavaScript to build blocks and to to

00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:37,189
put those in your regions and your

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,649
themes and also the blocks utilize the

00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:42,199
same idea of visibility rules where you

00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:45,529
can say hey I want this block to only

00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:48,850
show up on this page in the app or I

00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:50,930
want this block to not be visible to

00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:54,680
anonymous users but I want it to be

00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:58,399
visible to authenticated users Drupal

00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:01,100
gap also exposes your your Drupal user

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:05,420
and it knows all about the the users

00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:06,980
roles and the user ID name email etc so

00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,019
all that stuff is available to you in

00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:13,129
this JavaScript environment to to work

00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:15,110
with it excuse me as needed and again

00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:20,000
following along with the following along

00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:21,769
with Drupal Drupal gap has menus and so

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,019
you know as you're building your app

00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:27,259
obviously we need a way for our users to

00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:30,559
to navigate around or to have menus

00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:32,029
displayed on certain pages or show up

00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:35,809
for certain people or not for other

00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:40,670
people and we can define our menu links

00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:44,170
and place them in our regions and that

00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:47,360
helps in really simplifying just

00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:49,939
managing across your app across all

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,230
these multiple pages instead of you know

00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:53,089
when we first started building websites

00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,129
before all of us heard about Drupal we

00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:57,860
were probably sitting there typing

00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:59,480
static HTML pages and there's got to be

00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,600
there's got to be a better way to do

00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,879
this so it kind of goes back to when I

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,730
first started building mobile apps I was

00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,500
doing that static HTML stuff and I was

00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,179
thinking man this reminds me a lot of

00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,189
when I started building websites and

00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:15,380
there there's got to be a better way so

00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:15,889
I took a took a little time to see if

00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,319
there was any

00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:19,939
thing out there this is about two and a

00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:21,379
half years ago now and they're there

00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:23,600
didn't seem to be anything and then

00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:26,569
that's where I got the idea that hey you

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,819
know I should take a lot of the concepts

00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:31,279
that were familiar with in Drupal and

00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:33,619
let's see if we can we can expose that

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:37,339
in this phone gap in jquery mobile

00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:41,239
environment to to aid in simplifying the

00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:45,230
development of mobile apps and of course

00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:47,119
especially when we are building any type

00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,429
of app almost always there's going to be

00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:51,859
some type of user input involved so

00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:54,649
drupal gap comes with a forms API it as

00:15:51,859 --> 00:15:57,079
well and again it follows along pretty

00:15:54,649 --> 00:16:01,519
strictly with the the drupal forms api

00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:03,980
in that it's easy to create you know

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:07,459
your typical input elements like hidden

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:09,290
inputs select lists let's see what else

00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:13,699
we got text fields radio buttons

00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:16,160
checkboxes submit buttons and as you're

00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:18,499
declaring your forms you can attach a

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,129
custom validation handlers to your forms

00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:25,480
if you need or well every form typically

00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:28,549
has a submit handler so again you

00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,439
declare your submit handler in it drupal

00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:32,329
gap automatically assembles your form

00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:34,369
state values and passes them along so

00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:36,739
you can you can work with those forms

00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:39,529
data values and do whatever you need

00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:43,129
with those there so that's kind of a

00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:45,829
general overview of what Drupal gap does

00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:50,360
and the concepts that have follows along

00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:52,369
with Drupal so since since we can build

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,649
modules with Drupal gap that's where

00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:57,019
Scott was actually one of the early

00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:59,329
adopters of Drupal gap and we've been

00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:04,069
working working a lot together on

00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:05,990
improving Drupal gap core so we and when

00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:08,209
we found out or when I found out that he

00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:10,159
worked with the Commerce guys I thought

00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:11,870
well hey you know we should try to see

00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:14,839
if we can put something together for

00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:17,389
Drupal commerce so Scott and I worked on

00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:20,209
assembling the Commerce module for

00:17:17,389 --> 00:17:24,250
Drupal gap to make this whole in-app

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:24,250
purchases as painless as possible

00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:31,540
so we kind of missed a bit where I was

00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:35,500
going to talk about how apps are awesome

00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:37,690
and Steve Jobs rest in peace he was he

00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,190
loved talking about apps like it the way

00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,980
he was so infused about all of these

00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:46,030
apps and these applications that you can

00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:47,710
have in the App Store and we're going to

00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,570
try and show you now how you can get to

00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:53,080
these awesome apps with little to no

00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:55,510
code so we went over that the kit list

00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,090
earlier so if you're going to follow

00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:59,620
this kind of recipe it's Drupal 7 and

00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,610
you can kind of skip that one because

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,320
it's all packaged into commerce

00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:05,200
kickstart and what we've done with

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,740
kickstart is we forked it and we've made

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,710
of its commerce Drupal gap kickstart and

00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:13,600
we have all of the links for these at

00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,070
the end of this presentation and we will

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,140
share the slides with you so don't worry

00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:21,820
about taking notes on that bit and

00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:24,100
enough see Drupal gap we need there's a

00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:27,310
way to install it which tyler will talk

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:29,650
about now yep so we're all familiar with

00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:31,450
installing Drupal it's pretty pretty

00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:34,390
straightforward but if you've never set

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:36,190
up a mobile app environment before it

00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:40,330
can be a little intimidating your first

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:43,690
time so luckily there are so some great

00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:46,030
tools out there for example the the

00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:49,330
folks over at phonegap have developed a

00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:52,000
plug-in for the google chrome web

00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:55,030
browser and it's called ripple and that

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,310
essentially is a mobile app simulator

00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:59,860
right inside of Google Chrome's browser

00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:01,300
so that that's a great tool for us web

00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,280
developers because immediately that

00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:06,850
means we can you can use the HTML

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,340
inspector to look around at our our HTML

00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:12,100
elements in our CSS style and make sure

00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:14,080
stuff is working properly and of course

00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,570
we all know Chrome's development tools

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,630
also has our our network monitor so we

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:21,940
can see when we're doing service calls

00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:23,320
off to Drupal to make sure that those

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:27,610
are working properly and we're getting

00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:30,340
the proper responses when also you say

00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:32,590
and of course the JavaScript console log

00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:35,600
which is very very helpful for debugging

00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:38,720
and we can use breakpoints and iterate

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,890
stuff and and keep an eye on things as

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,250
they're being assembled and pushed

00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:45,200
around and passed around so that is by

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:48,110
far the easiest way to get started with

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,419
app development is to use a ripple in

00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,919
Google Chrome but eventually before

00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:55,340
deploying your app you're going to want

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:57,020
to to install it on you know I'm sure

00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,059
every single person in here has a

00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,100
smartphone so at some point you're going

00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:06,440
to want to install it on your your own

00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:10,909
device so if you're on iOS there you'll

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,860
be most likely using Xcode to assemble

00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:15,500
your app and compile it down and install

00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:18,260
it onto your device if you are on

00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:21,530
Android you'll be using Eclipse and

00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:24,559
likewise you'll use that to tip I'll it

00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:27,080
and install it on your device this is

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,330
all very well documented on Drupal georg

00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:32,780
so i won't go into too much detail on

00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:34,909
that but when it comes time to to

00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:37,039
install your app and get ready for

00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:38,750
deployment to the stores you're

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,630
definitely going to want to install it

00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:44,090
on your device and make sure you have a

00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:49,400
good understanding of your end users

00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:51,409
perspective and the the final part of

00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,350
kind of the recipe piece is a the

00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:56,090
payment gateway and there's some

00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:58,220
restrictions around how you can use

00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:59,960
apple's in-app purchase to unlock

00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:02,840
different features inside an application

00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,789
or sell digital products and again with

00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,440
google's payment gateway forget what

00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:09,230
it's called but with google's payment

00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,820
gateway for their digital products it's

00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,860
you're restricted to only selling

00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:15,950
digital products you're not allowed you

00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:19,309
can't charge your your iTunes account

00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:21,380
for t-shirts hoodies or any kind of

00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:23,750
physical product and obviously commerce

00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,730
kickstart is geared up to get you

00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,289
install quickly with a store that would

00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,470
sell physical products so in our

00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:32,210
demonstration we've plugged in a payment

00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:36,230
gateway that i wrote the phonegap

00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:37,940
integration for for stripe it's really

00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,220
easy to get started and the reason we

00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,770
view stripe as opposed to kind of PayPal

00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,740
is because it was really easy to

00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:47,950
tokenize card details client side and

00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:49,460
one of the problems generally with

00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:51,549
communicating card

00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:54,799
around his around PCI compliance and

00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:56,539
with stripe it token izes the card

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,549
details in the j s layer you can

00:21:56,539 --> 00:22:00,169
communicate up to drupal to your server

00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:01,970
and then process the payment and have

00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:10,179
the callback come back to your app which

00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:10,179
works quite nicely demo time

00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,560
anyone seen South Park at southpark fans

00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:24,830
only got like one or two laughs so I'm

00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:26,390
assuming that joke went for sure british

00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:28,870
humor doesn't really work in the states

00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,870
of everything

00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:55,200
the resolution is not high enough of

00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:57,210
anything does that kind of clear cut I

00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:02,269
can only kind of have see the screen

00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:09,389
from this angle can you see the button

00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:13,830
command F Wow sadly no justice that's

00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:28,499
just find one ignore my colleagues so

00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:34,349
china chef f11 that's not chrome has a

00:23:28,499 --> 00:23:37,529
presentation oh yeah oh wow you learn

00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:43,859
something new okay session over see you

00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:45,960
later okay so um here is we're using

00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:47,580
ripple to demonstrate and I will flick

00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,549
over to Xcode at some point and show you

00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:52,499
it in the iPhone simulator so you can

00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:55,619
show I'm not just making this up is

00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:57,179
isn't just a sign of I haven't just put

00:23:55,619 --> 00:24:00,089
styling man is to make it look like a

00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:05,339
nap it is an actual application so I'm a

00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:08,399
hand over toilet yes so this is kind of

00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:09,839
out of the box Drupal gap with just you

00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:11,549
know welcome to Drupal the apps cream

00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:13,710
that we just we just left there for

00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:16,049
demonstration purposes and you can see

00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:18,749
across the top there we have if you're

00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:21,479
familiar with commerce kickstart some of

00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:24,299
the menu buttons in there are they give

00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:26,999
you a way to browse things that you can

00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:30,149
carry things you can drink out of things

00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:32,339
you can wear and geek out with so we

00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:35,460
wanted to to mimic some of that stuff

00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:42,269
there let's go how do you exit

00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:49,559
presentation mode shift command ah there

00:24:42,269 --> 00:24:50,879
we go thank you sir so if you're

00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:52,830
familiar with kick start it comes

00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:54,359
prepackaged with these kind of different

00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:56,759
categories or different taxonomy of

00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,649
items and what we've done with drupal

00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:02,210
gap is have it read those items and

00:24:58,649 --> 00:25:05,700
display them in the app so here we have

00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:12,989
to carry to drink gear and to wear and

00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:15,419
you can see they kind of map so as you

00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:17,460
navigate through the buttons here it's

00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:20,339
automatically pulling in your your

00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,109
product listings and displaying them for

00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:24,389
you so as we go across the different

00:25:22,109 --> 00:25:26,070
categories we can kind of quickly see

00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:28,889
some of the products that are available

00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:31,349
for browsing in for purchasing and

00:25:28,889 --> 00:25:33,649
please pardon our small resolution here

00:25:31,349 --> 00:25:37,679
as things get a little stacked up but

00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:38,970
you can see we got it shows the the

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,170
picture of the products and the title

00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:43,900
and the pricing

00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:47,230
drupal gap has built-in paging support

00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:49,420
for views you can page across big sets

00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:52,690
of data the only one that has that as

00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:54,490
the the to wear section but then if you

00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,900
find you know from your customers

00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:58,120
perspective if they find something they

00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:01,480
like though they'll click on it and and

00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:04,780
check it out so then if you're familiar

00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:07,720
in Drupal with display modes on your

00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:10,450
your content types drupal gap listens to

00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:14,260
all of that and provides its own custom

00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:20,680
display mode so in your Drupal settings

00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:23,770
here you can you can change the the

00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:25,330
ordering of your fields and control

00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,670
whether or not you want your labels to

00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:30,220
show up and how and how certain things

00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:32,560
are displayed and your app will will

00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,840
dynamically respond to that so if you if

00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,220
you're changing stuff on your Drupal

00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,160
website and you already have an appt

00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,510
displayed it deployed in the store I'm

00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,400
not going to need to recompile it

00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:48,030
because it's it's constantly listening

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,030
to to what your drupal site has set up

00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:59,299
so see here yep across the manage

00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:01,700
display then we have a drupal gap

00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:04,249
display mode very similar to your full

00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,559
content or to user where you can order

00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:10,700
your fields control your labels and

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,929
control the the format of each field and

00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,789
what the application will do is

00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:16,399
obviously listen and adhere to whatever

00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:18,789
settings you've got in there so you can

00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:21,529
kind of give some power back to the

00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:23,779
merchants or the store owners or the

00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:26,359
admins or your client whoever and give

00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:27,709
them some functionality around how they

00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:30,679
can manage their display in their

00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:31,999
content one of the things that the App

00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:34,669
Store places restrictions on is

00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:36,139
obviously you can't keep packaging up

00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:37,849
your app and then we deploy we

00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:39,769
submitting to the App Store waiting two

00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:41,509
weeks just to make minor tweaks and the

00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:42,619
whole point of using your Drupal site as

00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:45,109
the back end it means you can update

00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:46,879
things without having to release a new

00:27:45,109 --> 00:27:48,709
version of your app so it's quite a few

00:27:46,879 --> 00:27:50,839
can add new products and not have to

00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:56,749
rely on waiting two weeks for the app to

00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:58,639
be approved in the app store so when we

00:27:56,749 --> 00:28:00,769
when we built the commerce module for

00:27:58,639 --> 00:28:03,320
drupal gap we we wanted to definitely

00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:07,099
take advantage of the Drupal gap forms

00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:09,049
API when it comes time to to display be

00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:11,869
the options that the customers are going

00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:14,359
to be choosing from so the commerce

00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:17,599
module for drupal gap understands the

00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:21,769
different products that you've set up in

00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:24,979
your store and if everybody hopefully is

00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:28,219
tried commerce at least once you you're

00:28:24,979 --> 00:28:32,349
essentially creating for example if we

00:28:28,219 --> 00:28:32,349
have a product we got here

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,970
command shift at

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:49,230
so you can see down here in our product

00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:52,110
variations section if you're purchasing

00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:55,260
a hoodie we have on the back end we have

00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:57,899
it set up so you know we have a gray

00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:00,830
color or a pink color and then small

00:28:57,899 --> 00:29:03,620
medium or large as our size options and

00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:06,360
the commerce module inside a drupal gap

00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:09,870
utilizes the the forms API and listens

00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,909
to your your Drupal web site settings

00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:15,450
and then automatically builds the forms

00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:17,039
for people and then once somebody finds

00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:19,529
out what they want they've picked their

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:23,220
options they can go ahead and add it to

00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:24,779
their cart so one of the things i wanted

00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,909
when i first joined commerce guys was

00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:28,740
the commerce guys pink hoodie and i was

00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:30,299
a horribly disappointed when we find out

00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:36,750
that the kickstart products aren't

00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:38,460
actually for sale but you know so so

00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:42,120
yeah so i'm going to order my large pink

00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:47,090
hoodie in large and yeah so i can have

00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:49,890
that to my cart and here we have the cop

00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:52,020
so skyle show you now that now that

00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:55,620
we've actually added it to the card in

00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:58,289
our app back on the website it's the

00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:00,779
website responds to this and immediately

00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:03,980
from the order administration

00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:06,600
perspective we can see that someone has

00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:09,779
started a shopping cart and they have

00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,580
added some items to it so it's in you

00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:15,120
know totally dynamic in real time so it

00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:16,830
it's it's listening to what what users

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,350
of your app are doing and you can kind

00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:22,049
of keep an eye on stuff as as users

00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:23,399
progress so and one of the things that

00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:26,850
we've done which is quite nice is

00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:29,480
because we built on Drupal gap it has

00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:32,429
all the user login stuff and the session

00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,830
services built-in so if a user is

00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:36,179
shopping in your in your native app and

00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:38,640
says okay i like this i'm going to add

00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:40,200
it to my car and then they're in a train

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,490
and they go through a tunnel and their

00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,350
app kicks out and then it get off the

00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:44,429
train and go home they flick back open

00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:46,559
the app it's still going to be in their

00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:49,010
cart so that is persists the data and if

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:51,450
they then log on to the website they can

00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:53,070
it was still being a cop because they're

00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,630
look if they logged in you still have

00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:57,810
the order day today

00:30:54,630 --> 00:31:06,450
so as we see a sweatshirt one pink large

00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:08,490
coming to me and I can obviously change

00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:11,100
quantities I can remove stuff for my car

00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:12,390
and that will update on the Drupal site

00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,580
because we're doing a service call so

00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:18,590
I've removed that one item if I flick

00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:20,550
back to hear refresh it's removed so um

00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:22,800
it's all pretty quick obviously I'm

00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:25,230
working locally so it's very very quick

00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,660
but still the service calls it's just

00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:34,520
jason data so there's no real there's

00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:36,540
not really much of a lag there so as

00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,160
somebody's gone through and they finally

00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,990
find something that they want to

00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:42,030
purchase they can go ahead and start

00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:44,550
with the checkout procedure that

00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:47,540
everybody's very familiar with so again

00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:51,660
we utilize the the forms API to provide

00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:53,670
the the check out information that needs

00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:57,120
to be collected to actually to make this

00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:59,030
happen so typically we start with the

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,310
billing information where you can

00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:05,010
collect the name of the person who's

00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:09,570
buying it the country where they reside

00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:12,330
in our address here in Austin and we all

00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:15,810
know that Austin has the 90210 zip code

00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:18,420
there and and very familiar with most

00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:20,220
checkout procedures you know you don't

00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:22,230
want to make a customer enter stuff more

00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:24,990
than twice so we got the the same

00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:27,840
feature that commerce implements so if

00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:29,100
you if your shipping information is the

00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:33,810
same as billing can go ahead and use the

00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:35,430
check box if not whoops okay then they

00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:38,520
can go ahead and enter that stuff if

00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:40,670
need be but in this case we will ship it

00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:44,160
to the same place we are billing it and

00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:48,750
we can continue onward in our checkout

00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:51,450
procedure and then typically next up

00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:53,670
somebody would select how soon they want

00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:55,800
it and we want we want our pink hoodie

00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:59,850
as quick as possible so we'll go with

00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:01,680
the express shipping one day and we'll

00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:04,210
go ahead and continue onward in our

00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:06,550
checkout process

00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:08,920
and at this point we go ahead and give

00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:12,070
someone a review of the order they can

00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:15,040
see that if they've selected express

00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:18,280
shipping one day for 15 bucks the the

00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:22,090
pink hoodie is 46 we got a little order

00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:24,810
total and then an account information

00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:27,280
overview and again drupal gap

00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:29,590
understands your drupal user and has

00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,710
access to their username in this

00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:35,050
instance where an admin we have Scott's

00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:37,810
address attached and somehow Scott

00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:39,940
convinced me to to purchase this for him

00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:41,860
so I'll get billed for it but little

00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:44,350
does he know I'll actually get the pink

00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:48,160
hoodie at my place aww I'll keep it for

00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:51,490
myself and then at the very end we'll

00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:53,500
continue onward after we are certain our

00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:58,480
order looks good we'll continue on to

00:33:53,500 --> 00:34:00,700
the next step so as I said before we've

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,530
integrated the stripe payment gateway

00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,960
and one of the things we built into this

00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:08,020
sort of commerce mobile development kit

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,790
is the ability to write your own payment

00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:12,940
gateway plugin so if your payment Gary

00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:15,520
does support tokenization locally you

00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:17,530
can substitute the commerce stripe

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,680
module inside Drupal gap for your own

00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:23,040
and it uses smart many paths to work out

00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:25,150
your order ID and you can sort of just

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,980
disable and enable other modules to

00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,630
you're not limited to stripe if you

00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:33,160
wanted to kind of use this technology

00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:37,630
but it's a good place to start test card

00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:40,830
details for stripe I think our this like

00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:40,830
yeah let's go

00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:49,179
so when I submit the payment what it's

00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:51,610
doing is tokenizing the card details in

00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:55,409
the JavaScript layer sending them up to

00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:58,510
Drupal via a service the Commerce stripe

00:34:55,409 --> 00:35:01,000
module Drupal then processes the payment

00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:02,710
with stripe will send a call back to me

00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,440
saying that's even been approved or not

00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:07,840
approved in this case I'm in test mode

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,130
so it's always going to be approved if I

00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,440
wasn't in test mode I have no money

00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:12,340
because I've spent it all to come here

00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,780
then it would get disapprove so

00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:17,830
thankfully I'm in test mode so i can

00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:19,720
submit this and my checkouts complete so

00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:25,140
that means that i should now have a

00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:27,460
complete order in side here so orders

00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:30,900
yep so that's that orders now pending

00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:34,060
and I'm going to load up my email yeah

00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:37,500
1739 I've got my order confirmation from

00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,500
kicks out so all good stuff

00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:50,690
so as I said I'm just going to quickly

00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:55,190
show you this running in Xcode so in I

00:35:50,690 --> 00:36:00,020
mean next clip now and I mean the iPhone

00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:04,910
simulator and if I exit the app now I

00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:07,610
want to load up skype hmm my screen is

00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:09,890
not bigger we exit the app I can see

00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:12,170
it's installed here when I can go back

00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:15,170
to it and I get all of the nice goodness

00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:20,540
that you get from an iphone I can log

00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:25,850
out lucky in etc I'm just going to

00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:27,530
quickly flick back to my slideshow okay

00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:33,140
so hopefully the demo gods were kind and

00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:36,560
I'm happy and we didn't really seem the

00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:38,720
app the Commerce out there because

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,690
there's going to be very few instances

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:44,750
where a brand or commerce site would

00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:46,130
want to just have a generic theme so we

00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,990
kind of left it as bare bones as

00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:49,940
possible and with Drupal gap you do have

00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:51,140
its own theme layer so you're free to

00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:54,530
sort of theme your apps how you want

00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:57,200
them there is more awesomeness in the

00:36:54,530 --> 00:37:01,520
future and we are going to progress on

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:04,400
to Drupal 8 so as drees talked about

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,310
briefly today and last year in Portland

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,880
the the whole web surfers web services

00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:13,310
core context initiative whiskey is all

00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,280
going to be built into Drupal core so

00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:19,400
that means we're going to have very easy

00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:22,070
access to to everything in Drupal as

00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,960
JSON or XML or whatever we need but most

00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:27,530
often times with mobile apps here will

00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:29,780
be using using JSON so as we move

00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:33,370
forward you know Drupal gap we plan to

00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:36,380
continue to support more and more

00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:40,190
contributed modules for example right

00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:42,290
now a Drupal gap has a few dozen I think

00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:45,260
contributed modules like we support the

00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:49,190
link module entity reference address

00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:52,230
field geo field

00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:55,319
let's see what else do we go remember i

00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:57,510
won push notification so you can turn

00:37:55,319 --> 00:38:00,720
your drupal site into a native push

00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:01,890
notification server and obviously get

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,930
all the benefits from being able to

00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:08,760
constantly ping your customers saying by

00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:14,099
this by this now yeah we also support

00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:15,599
like a five-star and read pretty much we

00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:17,579
try to concentrate on some of the more

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,059
popular contributed modules to support

00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:23,569
first and then of course it's all open

00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:26,339
source so if anybody comes across a

00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:29,309
field or a module that isn't supported

00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:30,990
we very much encourage you know give us

00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:33,510
a shout out me we can implement it for

00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:36,690
you or take a crack at it and go for it

00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:38,279
yourself since the kind of audience

00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:40,170
competition is mostly developers I

00:38:38,279 --> 00:38:42,450
thought probably worthwhile just showing

00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:44,390
you kind of quick kind of setup code

00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:46,680
there's documentation on most of it but

00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:48,660
Tyler mentioned earlier the settings J's

00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:52,200
file so it's kind of very similar in its

00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:55,349
idea and you just set your core kind of

00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,390
value so the Drupal setting site path is

00:38:55,349 --> 00:39:00,150
the path it's looking for to access all

00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:01,890
your Drupal services and the rest is

00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:03,750
self-explanatory I won't bore you were

00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:05,700
going over them all but it's just kind

00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,859
of course settings you can set your what

00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:15,509
your front page is going to be and all

00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:17,730
that kind of stuff so inside of our base

00:39:15,509 --> 00:39:20,220
directory here we have the app folder

00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:22,769
which is very similar to our sites all

00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:25,349
folder in Drupal so we have a place to

00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:27,990
to hold on to our settings and then

00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:30,599
place our contributed modules or our

00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:33,930
custom modules to handle to handle our

00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:35,670
site it comes with one core theme I

00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:38,190
couldn't think of a better name so it's

00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:40,980
used Easy Street 3 but if you wanted to

00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:43,680
place custom themes you could go ahead

00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:47,339
and create a theme directory in your app

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,829
folder and Drupal Georg has all the

00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:52,200
documentation for creating custom themes

00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:55,230
and I'd also like to point out that the

00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:58,170
jquery mobile crew also made a theme

00:39:55,230 --> 00:40:00,369
roller which makes it very easy for

00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:03,299
people like myself who

00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:06,970
have no graphic talent whatsoever so I

00:40:03,299 --> 00:40:09,039
utilize that tool a lot to to style my

00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:11,410
apps and to color them appropriately but

00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:12,910
it's got here he's got some artistic

00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:15,160
skills so he'll get in there and get

00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:18,309
dirty with some CSS and think things

00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:22,470
look really pretty so I'm just as that

00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:25,119
kind of to something tangible there is a

00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:29,079
shameless plug but I have an app in the

00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:33,490
app store that was in the top 50 for

00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:35,650
sports in the UK at one point not

00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:37,390
anymore but it basically uses the

00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:40,180
Commerce code and architecture and it's

00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:45,759
built on Drupal gap so this stuff does

00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:47,769
work and then we just wanted to provide

00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:50,589
a list of resources for all this stuff

00:40:47,769 --> 00:40:52,960
here everything's open source a lot of

00:40:50,589 --> 00:40:55,210
the projects their host on github all

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,390
the Drupal modules of course on Drupal

00:40:55,210 --> 00:41:00,910
drupal.org so the first one there is the

00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:02,769
commerce Drupal gap kick start

00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:05,499
installation profile that we put

00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:09,339
together that essentially just packages

00:41:05,499 --> 00:41:11,559
up commerce kickstart and drupal gap and

00:41:09,339 --> 00:41:13,539
the stripe stuff all into an install

00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:15,999
profile for you so if you want to have a

00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:18,460
quick demo to set up and try out that's

00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:21,930
that's a good way to go there's a link

00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:24,640
to the drupal gap project page there and

00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:28,180
commerce guys calm has plenty of

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,249
documentation and drupal georg has all

00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:34,900
kinds of documentation on how to utilize

00:41:30,249 --> 00:41:37,900
drupal gap to to do pretty much anything

00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:40,839
that it has features for their there's

00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:43,839
documentation there of course phonegap

00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:46,509
com to get access to their AP is and the

00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:50,079
different features that they offer for

00:41:46,509 --> 00:41:53,980
your devices jquery mobile com for all

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:56,410
your jquery mobile means and if you

00:41:53,980 --> 00:42:02,819
wanna the presentation slides at all we

00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:02,819
have it on our austin no there no 2028

00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:10,730
question questions no answers so dis ask

00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:15,980
questions I don't know if there's any

00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:19,369
answer yeah that Mike's a hot mic so if

00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:20,840
we can to someone want to just stand in

00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:23,090
our school to questions and be really

00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:25,190
nice or do you want to get up and down

00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:27,800
or if you just shout out I can repeat

00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:30,170
into the mic okay well I can say the

00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,730
first question here I've got a sort of a

00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:35,090
two-part question the first thing is

00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:36,770
looking at what you've done here I think

00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:40,130
I could implement all of that with just

00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:41,750
in a responsive theme and going directly

00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:47,150
to the website so the question is what's

00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:49,670
the difference American so I guess with

00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:51,800
a responsive website you don't obviously

00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:54,440
you can't sell a responsive website in

00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,480
the app store you don't have access to

00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,810
the camera in a responsive website as

00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,850
easily you don't have access to push

00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:05,960
notifications and all of the kind of

00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:08,480
rich apni goodness and phonegap is has a

00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,900
lot of plug-in modules now that expose

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,940
all of the app stuff to the developer so

00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:17,290
there's a really good share module for

00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:20,030
phonegap which lets you tweet Facebook

00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:22,670
share via Dropbox or whatever the app

00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:25,340
lets you do so there's lots of features

00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:26,960
in phonegap and in a native app that you

00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:28,250
don't get from the responsive website ok

00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,890
so those are features you just haven't

00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:32,990
covered so far yet here I see and then

00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:34,700
the we have an app that allows you to

00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:36,320
make an in-app purchase downloads

00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:38,390
downloads a document which is

00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,770
essentially a PDF but it's a little bit

00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:43,220
different then you can look at that

00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:44,540
document offline its premium content if

00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,910
you have some kind of premium content

00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:49,160
they can view so in commerce guys we're

00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:51,470
currently working on and David kitchen

00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,540
in the audience's is the lead guy on

00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:55,820
this one there we go so am of commerce

00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:58,040
downloads which utilizes the commerce

00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:01,910
license module and a bunch of other

00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:05,210
stuff in between which lets you sell

00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:08,119
access to content and with phonegap in

00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:10,609
the roadmap for drupal gap we have the

00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:14,480
ability to store the files locally and

00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:17,690
so that would fit your you skate

00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,910
just a quick follow-up to whether we

00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:22,700
like it or not there are millions if not

00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:25,490
billions of people utilizing app stores

00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:28,280
and downloading apps so that's just

00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:30,980
another reason why it's good to have

00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:36,140
both a desktop laptop website a

00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:39,710
responsive website and a mobile app in

00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:43,160
the kick start demo if you click on all

00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:46,430
you get into interface whether you're

00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:50,330
using faceted sorta guys please played

00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:54,440
with that and know is the honest answer

00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:57,590
day um we've got views and we've got

00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:59,480
views filters and but we haven't gone

00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:01,940
full hog and looked at the Search API

00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:06,170
and estee house which I don't think you

00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:08,690
have drupal gab has full view support

00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:11,150
for for paging and dealing with basic

00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:13,460
results set I haven't not yet and its

00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:16,730
support for the idea of exposed filters

00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:22,040
or faceted search but I would definitely

00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:24,170
like to make that happen someday um

00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:28,460
could you say something about Jay Drupal

00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:31,609
which is you know used by drupal gap yes

00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:36,410
that's a another open source project i

00:45:31,609 --> 00:45:41,240
started it essentially is a javascript

00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:44,690
library for the services module so it's

00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:47,840
if you wanted to build a stand-alone

00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:50,990
JavaScript application then you can

00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:54,290
utilize J Drupal two out of the box have

00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:57,590
user login logout registration and 2d

00:45:54,290 --> 00:46:00,680
crud on all your entity is so originally

00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:03,500
all that stuff was very deep with inside

00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:05,930
drupal gap but then I started playing

00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:08,359
around with pebble smartwatches and they

00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:09,980
have a jas framework and that's the day

00:46:08,359 --> 00:46:14,080
I got the idea that i need to yank all

00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:17,630
that stuff out of there and make it more

00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:20,170
usable across multiple JavaScript

00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:20,170
platforms

00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:28,590
I assume we could use drupal gap to do

00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:32,170
like some sort of rudimentary game as a

00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:35,860
phone or a mobile application and then

00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:39,100
use kickstart or kickstart commerce to

00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:42,550
say pay for upgrades in this particular

00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:45,630
game if I were doing that how do you

00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:47,410
guys do you guys think Apple or Google

00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:50,230
would have a problem with us

00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:52,240
circumventing the various payment

00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:54,430
systems they have in place yeah so that

00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,370
would be against their in a you'd have

00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:59,800
to use the Apple in a payment gateway so

00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:02,380
basically we could use commerce only to

00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:06,310
sell physical products so we can in

00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:08,740
phonegap you can build any app that you

00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:10,330
can code in JavaScript i guess but to

00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:12,040
sell access to extra features in that

00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:13,750
games you could utilize the drupal gap

00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,520
stuff inside your phone gap application

00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:17,050
and as long as you're using the Apple

00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,020
payment gateway you're not limited to

00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:21,280
descend in physical products you can

00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:23,290
long as that's the Gateway you're using

00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,920
then then I don't think Apple would have

00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:29,920
a problem with it cool oh yes you are

00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:32,920
right that commerce can only be utilized

00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:39,010
for physical goods as far as I

00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:43,180
understand hello first of all this is a

00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:48,790
nice work thank you the last month's uh

00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:50,410
I'm I'm dealing the with drupal theme

00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:52,690
said Drupal development the last five

00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:56,680
years at the last two or three months

00:47:52,690 --> 00:48:02,620
i'm dealing with phonegap so my

00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:05,830
questions is are um regarding if i

00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:09,520
decide if i understand correctly a the

00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:14,830
drupal gap is a phonegap application a

00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:19,210
phonegap project is it right no it's

00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:22,320
simply a javascript library essentially

00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:26,350
that you drop inside of your phone gap

00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:29,860
WWE just like you would install Drupal

00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:32,210
in your websites WWE and it just kind of

00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:35,540
takes over for you and then you

00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:39,830
can start utilizing modules and themes

00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:41,780
to to build upon it and it I didn't talk

00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:44,570
about this earlier but Drupal gap also

00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:47,740
utilizes the idea of render arrays so

00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:51,200
you can with your modules you can easily

00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:54,589
create buttons or links and stuff like

00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:57,099
that uses utilizing render arrays so I'm

00:48:54,589 --> 00:49:00,800
just hoping the world Drupal gapper

00:48:57,099 --> 00:49:03,500
application needle into my www folder in

00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:06,770
my phone got project in my Drupal

00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:09,800
installation I'm installing the Drupal

00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:11,330
gap module easy I'm right yes in order

00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,310
to have the connection between the

00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:17,660
phonegap application method Drupal

00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:20,660
installation correct okay a nice so the

00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:22,910
Commerce example is it just an example

00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:25,280
so i can have a simple Drupal

00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:28,970
installation okay with a Drupal gap

00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:31,430
module it's also expose my nodes so yes

00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:34,820
triple cap will expose your notes and

00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:40,820
will be different content types man I

00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:43,339
came I came configured to export for

00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:45,920
example the nodes of respective of a

00:49:43,339 --> 00:49:50,390
specific taxonomy term yes so in here we

00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:52,369
obviously these are product displays or

00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:55,820
their content types and this is a view

00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:59,900
okay oh yeah I'm not even on this just

00:49:55,820 --> 00:50:02,630
there we go so this is a view of a

00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:04,849
particular content type you understand

00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:07,369
and these are taxonomy terms a

00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:12,820
classified as content types so the phone

00:50:07,369 --> 00:50:16,670
the phone gap application just a is

00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:19,550
driving directly by a JSON file is it

00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:22,250
right so it's generating Jason it's

00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:25,760
consuming a Jason from Drupal okay nice

00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:28,369
hey my next question is regarding the

00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:32,000
thin layer of the phonegap application

00:50:28,369 --> 00:50:35,530
can I create for example this is I think

00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:40,520
that this is a jQuery Mobile a thin

00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:43,190
layer can I use the most a tradie like

00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:44,770
the onsen you I other or the ionic

00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:47,560
framework for the

00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:49,360
layer of something like this for example

00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:54,280
I would like to to make an application

00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:56,980
to dress it with a theme we're like the

00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:59,980
ionic framework code or the unseen UI

00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:02,140
framework and to connect this mobile

00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:08,380
application with my drupal with any

00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:12,340
Drupal is it possible with Drupal gap so

00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:15,790
I'm just gonna this is a mobile

00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:17,800
application bill on answering on Drupal

00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:20,890
gap this is a phonegap application bill

00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:24,580
on Drupal gap that incorporates some of

00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:26,350
the chocolate cookie JavaScript theme

00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:29,410
layer I think it's chocolate some

00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:39,520
something like that but it lets me do

00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:41,290
the just refresh your screen but it lets

00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,850
you use although you can just

00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:45,270
incorporate those libraries inside of

00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,270
Drupal yet

00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:56,579
at the one last question if i connect

00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:59,400
the first time to my drupal away from

00:51:56,579 --> 00:52:01,589
the phonegap application the first time

00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:04,260
i'm connecting to my drupal site and i'm

00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:06,930
getting the view results with my fourth

00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:12,089
for commerce products for example okay

00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:14,760
at the after now I'm opening again my up

00:52:12,089 --> 00:52:18,119
I have no connection Eden connection

00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:20,309
what is the result in my app so you can

00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:24,059
we have like you storage are you storing

00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:26,880
are you storing that the first visit the

00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:30,119
first results of the connection yes in

00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:33,750
your settings JS file in drupal gap we

00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:36,210
have entity local storage and views

00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:39,990
result local storage that you can enable

00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:43,079
and set expiration times on so it is

00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:47,760
possible to hang on to stuff when you

00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:51,480
are in offline mode ok nice at that last

00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:54,119
question hey sorry nothing well it's ok

00:52:51,480 --> 00:53:03,960
we like questions I am the guy behind

00:52:54,119 --> 00:53:06,900
you getting angry aye sir the main

00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:10,410
question except the technologies is a

00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:14,130
how can I convince a client of me to to

00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:16,650
buy this mobile application a it is it

00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:19,589
is almost a previous question but the

00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:20,940
main question of my clients is what is

00:53:19,589 --> 00:53:25,559
the difference of a responsive website

00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:29,040
at this one a Scott said before that the

00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:31,140
difference is that you can use them the

00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:33,030
Cordova plugins for example in order to

00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:36,599
speak with a camera in order to speak

00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:38,880
with a notification in order to but it's

00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:41,309
in just examples there are no there are

00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:44,250
no the plugins for example what plugins

00:53:41,309 --> 00:53:46,260
i can i can add to this application for

00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:49,079
example in order to to convince my

00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:51,059
clients to be i think it would pretty be

00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:52,829
pretty nice for me to say that every

00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:54,359
commerce store should have a mobile

00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:57,290
application because it's probably not

00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:59,849
true i mean your sites are just selling

00:53:57,290 --> 00:54:01,710
oranges i don't know i can't think of an

00:53:59,849 --> 00:54:02,910
example but not every commerce site is

00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,869
going to want to come as well but when

00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:08,539
you're sort of am

00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:10,829
and you want to utilize your customers

00:54:08,539 --> 00:54:12,630
data so if they're your customers are

00:54:10,829 --> 00:54:14,490
taking photos of them using the products

00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:16,230
and they're using product like reviewing

00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:18,660
the products it's quite nice that they

00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:20,490
can say okay I've bought this and I can

00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:24,029
see my order history and I can upload a

00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:26,490
picture for my camera or so it kind of

00:54:24,029 --> 00:54:29,430
its taking this content driven Commerce

00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:30,990
idea to it to a new level and one of the

00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:33,779
reasons that you might be able to sell

00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:35,609
us into a client is if you're building a

00:54:33,779 --> 00:54:37,529
native app you're talking like fifty

00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:38,999
thousand dollars i heard the guys up

00:54:37,529 --> 00:54:41,130
steadily active ella purrs here

00:54:38,999 --> 00:54:44,519
mentioned and that's per platform with

00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:46,410
phonegap pure multi-platform so I build

00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:48,450
it once and I've got blackberry I don't

00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:51,660
know people use black booze anymore then

00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:54,210
I'm sure I've got the google version the

00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:56,549
android version and obviously the iOS

00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:58,380
version so i'm saving money there and

00:54:56,549 --> 00:55:00,119
you don't need to go to a specialized

00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:01,380
app developer you can as drupal

00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:05,460
developers we can develop these

00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:07,619
ourselves at the for breeding this

00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:10,019
application i'm using the concert for

00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:15,329
example in order to be the phonegap

00:55:10,019 --> 00:55:18,539
application for for any device how can I

00:55:15,329 --> 00:55:21,089
build the Drupal gap application for the

00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:22,950
other devices we can use the same way

00:55:21,089 --> 00:55:28,859
for the from the consolidate the cause

00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:30,089
of our build way don't quite understand

00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:31,739
the question do you mean so when I

00:55:30,089 --> 00:55:33,150
finished building the application how do

00:55:31,739 --> 00:55:35,309
I package that for the different devices

00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:38,730
yes so fun gap has a command-line

00:55:35,309 --> 00:55:41,069
interface so go to Cordova bead iOS yeah

00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:44,539
i forgot build iOS and forget build

00:55:41,069 --> 00:55:46,859
android okay i'm going to the phonegap

00:55:44,539 --> 00:55:48,930
application let's just say i'm using the

00:55:46,859 --> 00:55:50,400
phone yes yeah yeah so this is open the

00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:54,029
phone kept on Jay in a perspective okay

00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:58,619
Thank you Thank 718 a real quick

00:55:54,029 --> 00:56:02,160
question regarding commerce Drupal gap

00:55:58,619 --> 00:56:03,690
stripe integration mm-hmm so we are

00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,099
going to be using commerce and stripe

00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:07,410
but we have a development shop that's

00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:09,450
interested in writing an app for us so

00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:12,989
we're not necessarily going to going the

00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:15,059
phonegap route the holiday is empty

00:56:12,989 --> 00:56:17,339
that's reusable outside of the drupal

00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:21,809
gap i would say

00:56:17,339 --> 00:56:24,289
quite a lot it's open source so it's not

00:56:21,809 --> 00:56:27,299
the best development work I've done but

00:56:24,289 --> 00:56:29,369
the the jail I was pretty simple all it

00:56:27,299 --> 00:56:31,769
does is capture the the field stuff the

00:56:29,369 --> 00:56:34,349
users filled in and token izes them and

00:56:31,769 --> 00:56:35,519
does a service cool so if your app

00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:37,200
developers want to take a look at the

00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:38,940
code is really simple when it utilizes

00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,430
the Commerce type module which is the

00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:46,680
heavy load bit the actual bit on the app

00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:49,289
is quite lightweight cool thanks zeg 1

00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:53,339
well thank you very much for coming I

00:56:49,289 --> 00:56:55,019
hope you enjoyed it I was expecting like

00:56:53,339 --> 00:56:58,259
a standing ovation but i'll take the

00:56:55,019 --> 00:57:00,119
claps that's fun so yeah and if you get

00:56:58,259 --> 00:57:02,369
