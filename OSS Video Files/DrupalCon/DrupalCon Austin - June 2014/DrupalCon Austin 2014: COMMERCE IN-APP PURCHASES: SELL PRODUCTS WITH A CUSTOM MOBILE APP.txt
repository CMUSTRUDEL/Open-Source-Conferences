Traditional commerce is dead! Maybe that is a bit too dramatic, but purchases made "In-App" have skyrocketed within the last year.

Come to this session to learn how to bring the massively expanding market of In-App purchases to your business. In this session we will show you how to leverage this route to market, with a Drupal Commerce site.

This session is great for business owners and site builders alike. Business owners can ascertain if an E-commerce site with In-App purchases is a worthwhile investment. While site builders can see that with relatively little effort, In-App purchasing can be implemented.

With "What's App" being sold recently for billions of dollars, with their only revenue stream being a $1.00 In-App purchase, it certainly makes sense to see what you could be missing out on.

Let us show you the future!
