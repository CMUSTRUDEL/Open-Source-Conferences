Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: CREATING A BLOG IN DRUPAL 8 & CONFIGURATION API
Publication date: 2014-06-04
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: kepford
What's new and improved in Drupal 8? Can you build full featured web sites with Drupal core alone? The I will demonstrate that the answer is a strong YES! The following topics will be covered in this session.

Changes to fields
New HTML 5 elements
Improved content editing
Display & form mode changes
Better mobile support
Views in core
Configuration management
In this session we will walk through each of these topics covering what has been added to Drupal 8 and how it affects Drupal site builders and developers alike. Last but not least we will discuss how the Configuration API makes managing your site's configuration in code much easier. Attendees will see how they can import and export configuration as well as store it in custom directories to better fit into their deployment workflows.

good evening good evening everyone so

00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:10,139
you've made it through day two of

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:13,290
drupalcon I'd like to get just kind of a

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:15,929
show of hands on kind of where the room

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,580
is far as Drupal developers or site

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,680
builders how many of you would call

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,970
yourself maybe like a Drupal site

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,029
builder you don't write too much code

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,810
but you use Drupal every day okay how

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:31,080
many would you call yourself femurs or

00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:35,460
something like that any developers in

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:38,280
the room all right cool pretty mixed bag

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:42,360
which is good so today I'm going to talk

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:45,120
about building a blog with Drupal 8 I've

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,280
changed the title in the last week or

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,510
two because they really think the key

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,480
point of what I'm going to talk about is

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:55,079
that when Drupal 8 launches it's going

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,300
to be the first I think Drupal release

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,039
that on the day it launches you can

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,070
actually build full-featured websites

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,019
with in the past we've had to wait for

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,020
contributed modules to be ported to the

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,030
new version of Drupal and really Drupal

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,610
8 it has so much functionality built

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,770
into it out of the box that that you can

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,439
actually build quite a few sites with

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,780
Drupal 8 that it with Drupal 7 core use

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,880
couldn't do so a little introduction

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,430
about myself I my name is Bob Sheppard I

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,860
work at media current and i'm a senior

drupal developer they're going on about

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:32,570
a year there and it's a great company we

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,189
build websites we do drupal we do

00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:38,729
content strategy as well as designing

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:41,009
and theming and back-end development and

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,619
we're looking to hire developers and

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,710
themer so if you're interested come by

also do a newsletter every week called

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:58,890
the weekly drop which is a weekly

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:01,829
rundown of the latest news in Drupal so

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,299
if you have interest in Drupal and I

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:04,710
think you do since you spend good money

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,969
to come to this conference you'll

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,369
probably find the weekly job is

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:10,140
something you'd be interested in so

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,959
check that out if you're not already

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,860
subscribed also if you are a subscriber

like the weekly drop and want to make

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,740
you know help make sure it continues i

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,920
am selling t-shirts in the drupal store

00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,540
and so you could go by there and pick up

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,140
a shirt and that helps not only me but

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:31,980
the drupal association so that would be

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,630
awesome alright let's let's start off

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,900
with the kind of a rundown of what's new

00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:39,630
and Drupal 8 there's a lot of changes in

00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:41,670
Drupal 8 and there's some of it has been

00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,820
controversial but I want to make

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,140
something clear if you've heard kind of

00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:48,360
screams and moans from the developer

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,100
community about Drupal 8 as a site

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,700
builder at somebody building sites in

00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:57,110
the Drupal admin it's not a drastic

00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:59,670
change it everything is kind of the same

00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,950
works basically the same way as it did

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:05,190
in Drupal 7 it's just improvements it's

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:07,650
more of an evolution in the design of

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:11,760
Drupal so we'll cover some of these

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:14,940
topics newfield API changes html5

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,269
improvements the content editing

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,950
experience is much better improvements

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,560
to form and display modes mobile

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,880
improvements views is now in core which

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,239
is probably one of the single biggest

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,200
improvements to Drupal and several other

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,750
things that we're going to we're going

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:36,120
to go through a few these one at a time

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:38,070
so html5 when we say html5 obviously

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:43,200
we're talking about more than just the

00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:45,900
the doctype and in Drupal 8 there's more

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,830
Drupal or more html5 integration with in

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,019
Drupal so that includes several new

00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,420
elements that are in the field API and

00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:56,430
one of those is picture element and this

00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,650
really helps if you're building or

00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,830
trying to build responsive sites and you

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:04,170
want to be able to provide a good image

00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,580
quality to your users on multiple

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,860
devices but you don't want to waste

00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,739
bandwidth or you want to maybe provide

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,910
art direction with the different on the

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,680
different devices so you want to have

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,329
some control over which image is

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,549
actually displayed depending on the

00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:19,229
screen size and so the picture element

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:21,479
was added html5 and that allows you to

00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:23,580
do this and you can kind of if you look

00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:25,289
at the code you kind of see how that

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,790
works basically there's media queries in

00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:28,200
line

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,440
this is supported out of the box with

00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,850
Drupal 8 you can configure this and it's

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,350
a it's a big win you can do this in

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:38,070
Drupal 7 but it requires the picture

00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:42,810
module so another another cool addition

00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:44,970
is the date element an html5 spec the

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,850
date element allows you basically to

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:50,700
specify a text field form field is

00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:54,690
actually a date and that will allow the

00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:57,240
device you're using to use that context

00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:59,310
of what kind of data it's expecting and

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,310
provides you a calendar or a different

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:04,710
type of input element so when you're

00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,840
using a computer something like like to

00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:09,660
say the Chrome browser you get a nice

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,580
calendar popup to select your date and

00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,290
whereas in the past like you may have to

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,700
use like a jQuery library or something

00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,590
like that to provide this functionality

00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,860
so now this is just provided by the

00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:21,540
browser so that's in Drupal 8 the new

00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,060
element other new elements are email and

00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,360
phone and again it's the same kind of

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,400
idea because the browser is going to

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,400
know what what to expect what kind of

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,620
input to expect it makes it great for so

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,180
if you've ever used a form on your on

00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,310
your iPhone or your Android phone and

00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,290
you need to enter in a phone number it

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,570
provides you with the the number pad

00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:46,950
this is it just works like this out of

00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:50,910
the box with Drupal 8 another probably

00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:52,890
one of my favorite html5 attributes is

00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,960
the placeholder attribute so on any text

00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:57,870
field you can add a placeholder

00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,450
attribute and you can kind of it's kind

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:03,030
of like a tooltip basically within the

00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:05,130
text field so if you're the user is

00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:07,050
expected to enter a phone number you can

00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,330
provide an example of what that looks

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:12,180
like and it's just great out you can

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,860
theme this with CSS of course but this

00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,580
is something that's just supported out

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:20,040
of the box in Drupal 8 no so all these

00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:23,190
were kind of html5 elements these are

00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,390
all a part of the field API now and but

00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,340
there are several other improvements to

00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:28,230
field API so they're modules that have

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,180
been added one cool thing is that

00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:32,520
comments are now filled so you can

00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,790
control the display and the ordering of

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,760
comments within the UI now in a much

00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:39,910
easier way the entity reference field

00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,700
has been added

00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:44,950
to Drupal core and this is a module you

00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,230
use quite a bit if you want to create

00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,480
like a relationship between one content

00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,370
type and another content type so that

00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,980
you can link back and forth you can link

00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:56,620
between users you can link between nodes

00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:00,460
any type of entity and this is extremely

00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:02,950
powerful module in Drupal 7 that I use

00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,380
almost on every project and now it's a

00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,630
part of core the link field has been

00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:11,830
added to core as well as the email field

00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:13,420
and a telephone field and but you know

00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,810
those are just things that you're almost

00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,580
going to use on almost every site so

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,740
let's move on to content editing and

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,140
this has probably been one of the single

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,930
biggest gripes for folks that are

00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:27,940
evaluating Drupal is that editing

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:30,460
content has not been the most beautiful

00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,870
process in the past and we often get

00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:35,230
compared to WordPress and how much

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,520
better that you I is an experience so a

00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,970
lot of work went into the user

00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,830
experience for editing content on Drupal

00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,180
and one of the things that people have

00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:46,930
been screaming for four years is

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:50,410
basically a WYSIWYG out of the box set

00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:52,720
up in Drupal core and for Drupal 8 ck

00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:55,180
editors been added as the WYSIWYG of

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,120
choice and it's not just like a kind of

00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,650
a bolt-on thing where yeah we have a

00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,070
WYSIWYG editor it's actually very

00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:04,990
tightly coupled to Drupal so that

00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:08,020
whenever you're creating content types

00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:12,010
whenever you're using editing content

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:14,320
anyway it's really configurable at the

00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:17,169
same time as it it's it's easy to set up

00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,630
and I've done a little bit of work with

00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:23,470
WYSIWYG editors and like tiny MCE in

00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:25,000
seek editor and seek editors really and

00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,820
not it it's probably one of the best

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,520
WYSIWYG editors out there their API is

00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:33,820
is pretty easy to work with it's

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,469
mobile-friendly it's skinnable you can

00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,539
customize it it's not that big of a deal

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:40,390
to write a plugin for it and so I think

00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:42,580
as you start to work with it if you need

00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:45,070
to extend it it's you can find that

00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:48,180
that's easy to do so I think it's a

00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:51,880
really solid choice as a WYSIWYG editor

00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:53,140
another cool feature that gets you know

00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,630
kind of

00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:59,070
use a lot in and big talks about Drupal

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:01,150
8 is a inline initi inline images and

00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:04,300
again here's another thing that's always

00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:06,490
requested and can be a pain to set up

00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:09,160
and out of the box Drupal 8 has a new

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:13,210
allows you to insert images in line with

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:16,210
captions using ckeditor we also have in

00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:17,560
place editing now in Drupal core so this

00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,480
really looks cool when you're doing

00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,340
demos and I'll show you what that looks

00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,260
like but basically it allows you to

00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,240
quickly edit content without having to

00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:28,840
make three or four clicks to get to a

00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,430
node so and finally we'll look at we'll

00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,010
look at real quick about the improved

00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:35,740
publishing and user experience for for

00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,900
just creating a node so the WYSIWYG

00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,960
editor so here's a quick little

00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:44,560
screencast of the ckeditor and in action

00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,300
so we can insert images and it's nothing

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,000
you know it just looks like a pretty

00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,590
straightforward WYSIWYG editor but it's

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,080
so nice just and I have to set this up

00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,420
on every side anymore you can configure

00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,210
it turn you know different buttons on

00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,580
and off and that kind of stuff but it's

00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:03,730
just nice that we don't have to assume

00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:06,490
that or we can know that there's going

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,290
to be a ck editor installed on a client

00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,150
site we don't have to make a decision

00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,430
there we can we can assume that it's

00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:14,290
going to be available and so this makes

00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:17,260
developing Drupal sites a lot easier in

00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:21,280
my opinion one of the cool things you'll

00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:25,300
notice is that we're able to have a

00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:28,450
published and unpublished it's not like

00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:31,510
a to check box anymore so if you've ever

00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:34,960
had a client request that you have some

00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:37,960
sort of draft the state for your content

00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:40,270
and or that it doesn't really make sense

00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,980
to a lot of folks that are using Drupal

00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,840
sites to create blog posts and stuff

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,610
like that that you have to check a box

00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,740
to say this is published or uncheck a

00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:50,410
box to say like this is unpublished and

00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:53,020
so I think as far as user experience

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:56,890
that the the improvements on the note

00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:59,140
for more just shoes are just huge so you

00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,970
can basically it's been converted to a

00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,400
button which some of us developers might

00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,930
think is a little trivial but I really

00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,620
think it's a big deal to people that are

00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:12,149
using Drupal

00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:13,649
so in place editing as a developer and

00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:15,149
if somebody's use Drupal for a long time

00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:18,600
it's not something I'm too excited about

00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:20,129
but I guarantee you clients will will

00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,959
really like this so if you go to your

00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:24,300
home page you want you found a typo

00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:26,370
right on a blog post and you want to

00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,259
quickly edit that you can just basically

00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,290
on the contextual menu you can just

00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:33,509
click Edit quick edit actually and then

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,189
edit the post and it'll be saved right

00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:38,699
there without actually going to the node

00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:41,459
page which i think is like really the

00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:42,660
handy for somebody that's not that

00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:44,009
familiar with Drupal it's just really

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:49,379
easy to go in there and make a quick

00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:51,329
change so let's get a little bit deeper

00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:54,689
into Drupal forms and field display

00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:57,540
changes and again here's this is not a

00:11:54,689 --> 00:12:00,420
massive change in Drupal 8 but i think

00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,610
it's a it's a pretty good change so

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,470
previously you would manage your field

00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:07,470
sorting you had like a managed fields

00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,149
tab right now you there that's been

00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,040
split out to a managed form display and

00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:14,759
a managed display and so you can control

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,370
the order of an element in your form on

00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:20,089
one tab and then the display of that in

00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:23,309
a separate tab and your manage fields is

00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:25,230
it is in its own tab so basically it's

00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:27,660
just it's just a little bit easier to

00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:31,050
identify where you need to go to update

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:33,269
your content types we're going to talk a

00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,720
little bit more about this views display

00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:37,829
our view display modes basically are

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,499
we're all familiar with that if we built

00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:42,269
a Drupal site so out of the box with

00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:44,730
Drupal you're going to have the full

00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:47,160
display mode which is like if you click

00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,620
on a tab are sorry if you click on a

00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,089
node and you go view that full full node

00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,279
you're going to see the full view mode

00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:55,050
display but if you go to your homepage

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,660
the river of news kind of you see the

00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:01,410
teaser display and there's also a

00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,939
display mode for RSS feeds but out of

00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:04,589
the box Drupal 7 that was pretty much

00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:07,829
all you got like if you wrote your own

00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:10,649
custom code you could extend that but

00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:12,569
now in Drupal 8 you can create your own

00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:16,069
view modes and what a view mode is is

00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:19,079
basically just a display of an entity so

00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:19,920
this really what what using these view

00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,180
modes is really

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,490
powerful because you can create

00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,410
different displays for an entity and

00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,839
then you can reuse those displays

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:30,630
without having to every time you create

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,029
a view add custom fields and custom

00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:34,769
order you can just set up like a

00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:36,810
headline view mode you can set up a

00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:39,269
teaser view mode you can set up an image

00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:42,720
teaser view mode and then theme those

00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:44,970
and add your CSS and then you reuse

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,910
those Styles all over your website and

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:50,850
without having to add in custom template

00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,709
files for every view or right you know

00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:55,410
custom code in your template dot PHP

00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:57,810
file so you can use these view modes

00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:00,120
over and over on your site which is

00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:02,339
really cool and but it's been kind of

00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,560
something that wasn't well supported and

00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:07,589
Drupal like you could easily write like

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,800
a hook entity info alter function and

00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:13,050
declare your your view modes and add new

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,070
ones that way or you could install the

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,230
several there are several different

00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,940
modules you can use to install but it's

00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,040
it was kind of only kind of partially

00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,110
supported in Drupal core you had to add

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,790
this extra functionality to be able to

00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:25,560
use it so now in Drupal 8 you can create

00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,470
and manage your view modes for all

00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,630
entities right out of the box you can

00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,829
have view modes for forms or you can

00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,050
have four modes is what they're called

00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:37,649
or view and view modes and you can

00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:40,370
customize those per entity so basically

00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:42,540
if you're familiar with the view modes

00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:44,459
then you're going to like this because

00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,110
you don't have to install entity vemos

00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:50,070
module and you don't have to write

00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:52,100
custom code just to do this if you're

00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:53,730
not from those view modes I suggest like

00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,620
investigating that a little bit more

00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,240
there's a really good talk from

00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,930
drupalcon Denver about these and why

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,790
they're awesome or just google drupal

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,740
view modes and look into that because i

00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,959
think it's it's probably an area of

00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,940
Drupal that's not really known as much

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,800
about I know a lot of developers use it

00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,930
and aware of it but I don't I think a

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,269
lot of people are just not aware of what

00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:21,149
they can do with that so do investigate

00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:22,860
that so basically if you go to the view

00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:26,910
modes page you can just basically add a

00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,899
new view mode in the interface and you

00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:31,620
know you're not you're not have to write

00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:33,300
custom code for it so for each yeah I

00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:37,220
don't know why it's

00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:40,050
I don't know if it's going to work

00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:42,750
apologize it's a screen resolutions a

00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:45,470
little bit different or something let's

00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:49,560
try that does that work yeah there we go

00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:51,680
alright so basically like these are all

00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,089
different anti-d types of content user

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,459
taxonomy so each can have their own

00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:58,230
different view modes and you can create

00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:00,029
this from the interface alright so

00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,230
you'll have to bug your developer buddy

00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:04,290
to do it or you don't have to install a

00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:08,160
separate module alright so let's talk a

00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:10,860
little bit about mobile so everyone in

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,899
here is probably aware that our sites

00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,610
need to be ready for mobile users and

00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:18,440
people are visiting our sights on mobile

00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:20,760
devices it's it's just a fact of life so

00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,730
Drupal should support that in a much

00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,350
better way than it does currently and if

00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,329
you build a Drupal 7 site you can do

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,310
that but it takes quite a bit of work

00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:30,810
you need to worry about your theme there

00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:33,839
are modules you have to install the

00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:35,130
handle images there are you when you're

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,640
dealing with tables that's a whole other

00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:41,190
problem to deal with so Drupal 8 a lot

00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,500
of workers went into the mobile front of

00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:45,329
Drupal 8 so all the themes in Drupal

00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,520
core are responsive and that sounds like

00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:48,930
really good on a slide you know but we

00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,050
do need to realize that's just bartok

00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:54,480
and 7 so that's two themes but it is

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:57,149
that it is it is important I mean is the

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,140
admin theme is responsive and and the

00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,240
the theme that it ships with

00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:04,350
out-of-the-box is responsive so that's

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,000
good the mobile toolbar is also

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,610
something's been backported you can you

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,100
can use that in Drupal 7 now but

00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:13,559
basically when you're on a mobile device

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:16,230
you get this icon type display see here

00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:20,429
and when you're on a bigger screen you

00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:22,500
get the icons plus text so it it works

00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:25,199
really well I you can actually install

00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,880
Drupal on a mobile device so you can you

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:31,320
can be using droop you can basically

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:34,620
open up your phone to the drupal.org or

00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,390
whatever / install and actually run the

00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,580
installer from a phone which is pretty

00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:41,100
crazy but that's that's how deeply

00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:43,590
mobile is supported it's not just for

00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:46,230
content editing or viewing a site and

00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:47,040
one of my favorite decisions was to kill

00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:51,830
the overlay

00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:54,570
jewel I think we all probably don't like

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:57,450
overlay module was basically if you

00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:59,700
clicked anything it's like @ / admin or

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:02,460
you edited content instead of actually

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:05,370
going to that page an overlay would pop

00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:09,440
up in the window and then load that page

00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,440
within the page you are already in and

00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:17,310
there's me yeah yeah so horrible for

00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:19,800
accessibility horrible 43 mming or kill

00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:23,160
kittens all that stuff is horrible so

00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:25,380
we're all glad it's gone I am sad for

00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,810
anybody who put work in that that their

00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:30,270
work has been tarred and feathered for

00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:34,220
so many years but yeah I don't think

00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:36,240
many of us are very sad it's gone so I

00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,130
think pretty much everybody's here is

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,300
probably excited views in core like why

00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:44,220
did it take so long but with views being

00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,700
in core like that that's that's a huge

00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,140
for several reasons not it's not just

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,210
because we don't have to download an

00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:59,340
extra module because when something is

00:18:51,210 --> 00:19:01,440
in core versus it being a contribute and

00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:04,140
so that's exactly what's been going on I

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,080
think there are still a few listings in

00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,480
Drupal 8 that are not using views I may

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,210
be incorrect about that but most of the

00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:15,470
listing pages and enlists in Drupal 8

00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:18,630
now our views of if there were static

00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:20,580
basically static functions or you know

00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,260
hard-coded functions before they've been

00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:25,530
converted to views which is really cool

00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:28,170
because that means you can modify things

00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:31,020
in the admin that before would require

00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:32,910
would be more complicated to modify and

00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:35,460
probably most of us wouldn't do that so

00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:38,730
now most of you listings in core are

00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:42,090
views it's easy to create feeds because

00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:43,680
of that like so out of the box 7 you you

00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,650
could create an RSS feed pretty easily

00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,510
but now you can create a JSON feed you

00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,820
can create an XML feed basically any

00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:53,790
view so if you're familiar with views

00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,980
and you use it it's there it's not very

00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:59,520
different at all but it's in core and so

00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,690
that really helps helps us out it's just

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,180
the same views you know and

00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:07,710
of already so so here's an example of

00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:11,010
here's some lists I basically a list of

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,690
different views that so you look down

00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,180
this list so contents or your content

00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:18,270
admin to view your file displays of view

00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:20,370
the front pages of you listing of users

00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:23,160
of you recent comments so a lot of

00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:24,930
blocks that were hard coded before are

00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,290
now abused so you can configure those to

00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:29,850
make them actually useful and you can

00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:31,650
you know customize your front page I

00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:34,110
mean a lot of these were actually things

00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:36,510
that we just disabled and replaced with

00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:38,160
a view in the past as like a media

00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:41,610
kernan and probably a lot of you've done

00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,960
that so it's just these are these are

00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,880
just kind of best practices that have

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,660
evolved over time and now now they're

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,730
being put into Drupal core so one of our

00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:58,070
favorite things to hate on is blocks

00:20:50,730 --> 00:21:01,170
right so you might be using panels or or

00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:03,900
context but there have been improvements

00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:06,270
major improvements to the blocks API so

00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,790
a lot of blocks in Drupal 7 are

00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,810
hard-coded which basically means you

00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,370
probably aren't using them because

00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,620
they're hard coded and they're hard to

00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:16,680
change so you would just replace them

00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,930
with a view but now many of the blocks

00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,460
are views and not only use their

00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,770
configurable because now they're full

00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:27,540
entities which means that we can add

00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:30,060
custom fields two blocks and so imagine

00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:32,130
so it's basically like a block is the

00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:34,800
same as a node now basically so you can

00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:37,500
add fields to it their view modes for it

00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,660
so they're they're a lot more valuable

00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,060
now so they're they're not they're not

00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,560
the same as nodes but imagine all the

00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,510
flexibility and what we do with content

00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:50,550
types that is pretty much the way a

00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:52,320
block is now another feature that you

00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,690
know just didn't work in Drupal 7 is if

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,310
you put a block in one region you

00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,360
couldn't place it in another region it

00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,440
couldn't be rendered twice you dead

00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,550
there's a special i can remember the

00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,040
name of the module but there's a module

00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:04,530
that does that but now that's not a

00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,810
problem Drupal 8 supports that out of

00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:10,980
the box and I mentioned custom cut block

00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:12,270
types which unless you've actually had a

00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,820
need for it kind of sounds crazy

00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:16,460
probably

00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,050
but we'll look at just the the custom

00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,340
block library so we it's really easy

00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:22,310
it's the same as basically creating a

00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:25,850
content type so they're out of the box

00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:28,250
there's one block type but for example

00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:32,060
say you're running a blog and you have

00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:35,570
sponsors and you want to create a custom

00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:39,040
blog type that has a field for the

00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:40,580
sponsor ID or maybe a field for some

00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,130
JavaScript or something like that

00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:44,720
something horrible like that you could

00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:47,090
do that really easy without writing any

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,790
custom code so you create a custom block

00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:51,110
type and then you add the fields you

00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:53,840
need to it and all your fields are

00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:56,030
available so you can add images to your

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,190
blocks and so it's just it's just

00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,510
another powerful tool so if you think

00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,610
about all the things that you could do a

00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:03,620
Drupal 7 and all the modules that these

00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:05,960
are all all these features are replacing

00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,490
it becomes real clear that you can

00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,930
actually build a lot of the sites you've

00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:13,100
built in Drupal 7 with a bunch of

00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:15,830
controls with just core now and I would

00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,540
really like to see folks start building

00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:19,070
install profiles with Drupal 8 actually

00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:21,470
just showing kind of what can be done

00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:26,720
out of the box because I think it'd be a

00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:29,140
huge selling point for Drupal so we've

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,340
talked a lot about building sites and

00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:34,190
cool functionality mobile and things

00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:37,670
like that one of the things that's been

00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:40,280
kind of neglected is is basically

00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:42,470
helping users that are new to Drupal or

00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,270
helping people that are content editors

00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:46,760
of Drupal sites helping them figure out

00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:49,010
what to do there are some cool

00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,470
JavaScript libraries that will kind of

00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,700
guide you through a website when you log

00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:55,580
in for the first time if you've ever

00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:58,010
used I believe some of like base camp I

00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:00,230
think does this there's several I think

00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:02,960
github does it as well but the first

00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:06,020
time you login to the site you get kind

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,970
of a guided tour and so there's a module

00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:11,240
if a Drupal called tour and now that's

00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:13,880
in core so you can create custom tours

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,190
through your site for that your client

00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,780
or for your users that basically walk

00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,430
them through the process of doing

00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,440
something on the site and I'll show you

00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:23,990
a quick demo of this the views module

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,910
has this set up already so you can kind

00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,559
of see how to work with the views

00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:29,240
interface so

00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:31,820
so basically you click a button that

00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,340
says tour and then it basically gives

00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,809
you text and when you click Next it

00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,029
gives you instructions and it points to

00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:39,320
different parts of the page and so I

00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:41,570
mean you could do this before but it

00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,330
required setting up you know a jquery

00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:46,039
library that would do this and now it's

00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:47,330
just a part of course so now when you

00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:49,460
develop a custom module if you're a

00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:51,230
developer you can actually ship a tour

00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:54,740
with your module to describe how it's

00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:56,960
supposed to be used and this is just you

00:24:54,740 --> 00:25:00,009
know I mean there are so much in Drupal

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:03,230
now and there's so many features that

00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:05,179
you know it sometimes on ice every time

00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:07,970
I talk about this it just blows my mind

00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:13,220
actually because so much is is is out of

00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:15,139
the box just set up for you you can use

00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,730
it in seven yeah i think i think there's

00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:18,470
i'm not sure if it's called tour module

00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:20,509
somebody can in the room probably knows

00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:23,360
the answer to this but there are there's

00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:25,220
like I think a couple modules that kind

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,590
of do this and I believe there's a

00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:32,059
software as a service that will help you

00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:34,820
with this process as well yeah joyride

00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:35,929
so there's there's a I don't know if the

00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,659
modules call I think there is a module

00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:41,330
called joy ride but I think it is just a

00:25:38,659 --> 00:25:48,559
wrapper for the joy ride jquery library

00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:52,100
if i'm not mistaken alright so we built

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:55,070
the site we've kind of used a tour

00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:57,740
module to give our users a guide through

00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:59,470
what we've done but we haven't really

00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,879
addressed the developers too much and

00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,649
like what happens after we launch the

00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:06,830
site and we need to make changes and we

00:26:03,649 --> 00:26:09,039
need to make sure that the configuration

00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:11,330
that we wrote and the initial build gets

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:15,049
gets updated on the production site

00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:18,590
without losing any user data so a ton of

00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:20,659
work has been put into the sea MI or the

00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:22,730
configuration management initiative and

00:26:20,659 --> 00:26:26,950
basically if you're not familiar with

00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:30,379
this drupal in the past has stored

00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:34,100
configuration as well as data or content

00:26:30,379 --> 00:26:35,600
in the database and and really the fact

00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,789
that it's stored in the database is not

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:41,120
really the biggest issue the biggest

00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:43,760
issue is that it's not done in an API

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,559
way that it there are different ways

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,500
that different types of configuration

00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:52,250
were stored and it it just kind of has

00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:54,170
evolved over the years so this is a big

00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,910
pain point if you're developing Drupal

00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:59,150
sites and the scenario kind of goes like

00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:01,460
this this is one problem we develop a

00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:03,410
site right we commit the code to get

00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,360
maybe we push that up to a production

00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:07,790
server now we have people using the site

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,340
creating content users are creating

00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:12,950
accounts and things are changing things

00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:15,410
are moving fast then the client comes to

00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:20,120
us and says you know what we need to add

00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:21,410
a new field to this content type and we

00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,440
need to do that we can't have any

00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:26,990
downtime we have live data and all this

00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,240
so we so we pull down the database we

00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:31,010
add this new field and in Drupal 7

00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,720
there's a way to kind of work with this

00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:33,970
it's called the features module there

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,320
are other ways to do as well but

00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,670
typically will will update the feature

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,429
module and that all of our configuration

00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:42,440
stored in code there but if you've used

00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:44,780
the features module it works most of the

00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:47,570
time but that small percent of the time

00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:51,590
whenever you hit problems there a lot of

00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:53,059
a lot of trouble and so getting getting

00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:55,070
your configuration that you've worked on

00:27:53,059 --> 00:28:00,140
in your dev environment up to production

00:27:55,070 --> 00:28:02,270
is quite an orchestration and a lot more

00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:04,280
complicated than it then it needs to be

00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:06,950
and so a lot of work is one into Drupal

00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:10,400
8 the basically handle configuration of

00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:14,290
modules anything is configuration in one

00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:17,059
way and do that across the board and so

00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:22,100
i'll show you just kind of basically

00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:24,710
what is supported so you can take your

00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:28,100
drupal site build it and export all your

00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:29,809
configuration into a tar.gz eps file and

00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:33,200
so all of your configuration for that

00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:34,400
site is now in the ammo files and we'll

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,130
talk about what they are in a minute and

00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,350
then you can take that file that from

00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:42,020
production pull it into basically

00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:44,090
imported into your development site and

00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,559
you have the same configuration then you

00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:48,559
can make changes on your on your

00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:50,960
development machine and export those

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:54,000
changes and then upload them to your

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:57,660
production site and none of your user

00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,510
will be affected at all and so what are

00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:02,310
you how was this look so basically it's

00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,900
really simple and this is the

00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:05,790
out-of-the-box supportive way in Drupal

00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:09,180
8 there's obviously going to be other

00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:12,030
ways to manage your configuration with

00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:13,410
like get and and your file system and

00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:16,440
that kind of stuff but this is this is

00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:18,660
the idea basically you go to full export

00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,300
click a button and click another button

00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,380
and you have at our gzipped file with

00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,240
all of your configuration for your

00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,280
complete site you can also do single

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,410
import & exports of like views and

00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,780
different pieces of your configuration

00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:33,740
but this is this is like the supportive

00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:36,440
way to do it and it's a huge win

00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:38,580
obviously there's still going to be

00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,180
extension extension of this like the

00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:43,950
features modules probably not going away

00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:46,140
from what I've heard from the features

00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:48,270
modules of the folks that are developing

00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,790
that is that it's basically going to be

00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:52,910
something that you install that will

00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:56,340
help you compartmentalize your

00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:58,350
configuration into features that similar

00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,330
to what you have now but now that Drupal

00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:03,990
handles configuration in a standardized

00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:06,780
API way the features module code is a

00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:08,760
lot more simple and a lot of issues

00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:12,300
we've had over the years will be going

00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:14,850
away so what does a configuration file

00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,470
look like and what is it when you when

00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:18,990
you download your configuration it comes

00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:22,680
out as a gamma file and yeah mo is a

00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:24,060
looks a lot like JSON or XML except it's

00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,890
a little bit cleaner they're just

00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:29,250
basically configuration files and you

00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:36,050
can see from this one this is a profile

00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:38,070
is this it's a field right an ID so

00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:40,140
basically they're pretty easy to read

00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,550
you wouldn't be editing these by hand

00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:44,000
usually you're just going to be

00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:46,380
exporting them making changes in the UI

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,850
every module is going to ship with it

00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:51,030
with the yamo file which is all this

00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:53,390
configuration as a file so this is a

00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:59,040
huge improvement over what we have now

00:30:53,390 --> 00:31:01,110
so the point of all this obviously is

00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,450
that you can build Drupal sites with

00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:06,030
Drupal 8 that you couldn't do with

00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:07,290
Drupal 7 you don't and I really want

00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,060
like today

00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:10,920
not a good time to build the Drupal 8

00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:13,220
side that you're going to launch I think

00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:16,440
juries address that the first keynote

00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,700
but i think it's not a but it's a really

00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,490
good time to actually start playing with

00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:23,910
drupal 8 and testing it out if you're a

00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:25,890
developer I mean it's a little risky

00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:27,360
like to build your own personal side

00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:29,400
would you played in that you know

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,750
whenever the next alpha comes out it's

00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,630
probably not going to be a smooth

00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:35,550
upgrade path but I really encourage you

00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:39,300
like to check it out like you can go to

00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:40,770
simply test dot me and install Drupal

00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,900
and like I think like two minutes or

00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:45,810
something like that and you have a

00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,910
Drupal installation in the cloud for

00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:49,950
like an hour and you can just play with

00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:52,130
it and then you just leave and you know

00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:54,390
it'll be destroyed if you want to

00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:57,500
install it locally you can do that as

00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:59,700
well there are several ways to do that

00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,380
pantheon as well is another way like I

00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,210
know that they've been advertising this

00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:05,160
week that they have Drupal 8

00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:07,470
installations that you can set up for

00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:09,450
free so there are several ways like to

00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:12,120
get it to try it out and kind of kick

00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:14,820
the tires but there's a lot of new

00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,110
things in Drupal 8 and then I things I

00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:19,470
didn't get time to talk about better

00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:20,640
multilingual support web services you're

00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:23,340
just getting all this stuff out of the

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,590
box so definitely I'm excited about

00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,840
Drupal 8 I hope you are too I got some

00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:30,120
links in my slides here for resources

00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:33,060
that you can check out after the slides

00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:35,160
are posted online media current has a

00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:37,380
Drupal 8 series that we have been

00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,940
updating over the past I don't know when

00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:41,310
we started a bit as long time ago and

00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,860
it's good stuff there's some good stuff

00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:45,450
on aqueous aight i also recommending in

00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:48,510
the weekly drop we have i have like a

00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:50,460
lot of up-to-date stuff as it's coming

00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:54,150
as developments are coming coming

00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:56,540
through the pipeline so yeah I'm excited

00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:59,040
about Drupal 8 I hope hope you are too

00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:01,050
please evaluate the session and if you

00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,970
have any questions I'm not guarantee

00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:05,240
I'll have the answers but I will I will

00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:07,680
respond so anybody have any questions

00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,040
there's a mic here if you want to come

00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,040
up and ask

00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:22,030
yes it is and I would say this to the

00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:24,970
about about what that question is

00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:26,830
ckeditor responsive is that if you're

00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:30,370
using ckeditor now I would really really

00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:31,960
recommend checking out like 4.3 or it is

00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:33,880
a four point three or four point four

00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,770
whatever the latest releases of it

00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,169
because they've made huge improvements

00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:40,870
and it the older versions were not

00:33:38,169 --> 00:33:43,120
responsive at all and now it is it works

00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:45,159
really good on mobile devices as good as

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,049
it a WYSIWYG can I mean we all hate wigs

00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:51,280
but you know I hate that one the least

00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:52,960
so first I just want to say thanks for

00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,700
the weekly drop that it's been awesome

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,990
resource so I really look forward to

00:33:54,700 --> 00:34:02,470
getting that every week so yes I was

00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:04,090
curious if the export feature for

00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:05,919
configuration is going to help do away

00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:07,570
with strong arm as well I mean is that

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,490
going to help export variables that

00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:11,230
exist within other modules or is it

00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:13,030
really just for exporting your content

00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:15,010
types and your fields and that sort of

00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:17,440
thing so I was waiting for the

00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,909
configuration management the strong the

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:26,889
strong arm module that we use now in

00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:30,429
Drupal 7 yeah okay but so when we export

00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:34,149
something it'll be included all

00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:36,639
configuration is is I was saying all

00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:38,740
configuration is is output as a file and

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,260
that's true i went to the configuration

00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:42,879
management talk yesterday just because i

00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,050
know ideally get these questions and I

00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,599
know there's been a lot of changes in

00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:48,639
the last like three months mmm so

00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:50,260
everything is exported is a file but all

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,419
your configuration is also stored in the

00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:55,210
database because of there were several

00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:58,300
concerns like performance was one

00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:01,810
security was another and the user error

00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:03,339
was the was the third one but that's a

00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:04,810
configuration change like you can switch

00:35:03,339 --> 00:35:07,540
there's just like this basically a

00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:09,550
setting in your in your Drupal settings

00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:11,230
file and you can say like I want all my

00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:14,589
configuration written out to the file

00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:15,970
system but out of the box it's all going

00:35:14,589 --> 00:35:18,099
to be in the database and it's always in

00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:19,900
the database until you hit that export

00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:22,359
button and then it exports all of the

00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:24,190
configuration files so for every module

00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:24,820
all the configuration is in store to any

00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:30,970
ammo file

00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:33,690
so thank you for the WYSIWYG editor are

00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:36,610
there is there feature parity between

00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:39,550
input formats and the buttons you see on

00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:41,470
the yes toolbar now yeah like when you

00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:43,570
this is what I was trying to say with

00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:45,880
like the tight integration so when you

00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:47,830
installed the standard I think it's

00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,240
what's called still the standard install

00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:53,290
profile when you're doing the Drupal 8

00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:55,810
installer it's it's very tightly setup

00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:57,280
so if you set up Oh out of the box like

00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:59,190
it has the bold and italic and Link

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,710
those are all set up in the text formats

00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:05,200
I haven't tried making like a custom

00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:07,840
text format and a custom wysiwyg

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,040
configuration but so I don't know that

00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,710
that happens I don't think that happens

00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,350
automatically but it is set up so like

00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:16,570
if you just turn on like you have bold

00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:18,550
turned on it you know it's gonna it's

00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:26,620
not going to strip out strong tags so

00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:29,400
that's if it answers your question it's

00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:31,720
a ckeditor module if you can like it's

00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:36,070
it's definitely not the WYSIWYG API

00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:37,570
module there I don't know that there's

00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:39,040
really much there's I don't think

00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,750
there's an upgrade path at all with

00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,930
Drupal 8 and seven it's a migration path

00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:45,760
so I actually don't know the answer that

00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:46,990
because it's now on course I don't think

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,610
like if you there's not a Drupal 8

00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:53,320
version of ckeditor but if it does

00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:55,930
inherited the code from the ckeditor

00:36:53,320 --> 00:37:06,400
module I would not expect it to be very

00:36:55,930 --> 00:37:08,170
much yeah any more questions alright

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,100
thanks thank you all for attending and

00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:11,100
