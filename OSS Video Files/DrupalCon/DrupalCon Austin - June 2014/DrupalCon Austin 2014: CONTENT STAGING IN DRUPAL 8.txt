Drupal 8 has made significant improvements towards the ability to stage configuration. But what about content staging? Has it gotten easier in Drupal 8?

The technical challenges faced with regards to content staging are mainly synchronization and content dependency management.

This session is targeted towards site builders and we will dive deep into the inner workings of the content staging solution that's being built for Drupal 8 and what improvements it brings to sites owners that need to stage or replicate content across sites.

Further, site builders will learn how this solution also applies to broader and sometimes more exciting use cases - content sharing and filtered replication across networks of sites and applications.

Scenarios that will be explored:

Traditional content staging
Editorial hub powering a network of light front-end sites
