Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: MY BRAIN IS FULL: KEEPING PACE WITH FRONT-END & UX INNOVATIONS
Publication date: 2014-06-05
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: eatingsBcwald
As Front-enders, we are expected to know and do more with our sites than ever before.

In the four years since the Drupal 7 beta launched, the Front-ender's toolkit has exploded with a multitude of tools, frameworks, (meta-)languages, and techniques, as well as a new set of expectations for what the Front-end ought to do: responsive grids and media, HTML5, Web Components, the list goes on and on.

Similarly, UX considerations have greatly expanded beyond simply 'styling markup'. We now have to consider user context, device capabilities, physical interfaces, performance, personalization... where does it stop? And how can we stay on top of things, even as they rapidly evolve?

This presentation will cover the following topics:

- What's happened? An overview and history of Front-end practice from shortly before D7's launch to present: what's changed, what's fallen out of style (remember Blueprintcss?), what was a flash in the pan, and what's rapidly become standard practice.

- Since Front-end practice has massively changed, but Drupal core essentially hasn't, how can we keep up? How might this change with Drupal 8?

- How can I as a Front-end/UX person stay on top of this and expand my personal suite of tools and skills?

	00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,830
yeah alright I guess we'll start on time

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,809
so everybody can can can get their

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,360
dinners early or hit you know make their

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:14,219
planes this session is my brain is full

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,230
keeping pace with front-end and UX

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,760
innovations so if you're here expecting

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,890
something else this is not the right

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,060
room this is also way more people than I

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,070
expected so thank you all for staying

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,449
until thursday we were totally ready to

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,880
play to an empty house and just tell

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,260
jokes and show mean gifs but apparently

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,429
we have to you know it might still do

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,679
that what we're going to have to do our

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,910
job today yeah thanks for thanks for

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:38,520
coming out for the last session I

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:40,320
appreciate that please work oh here we

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,440
go okay my name is David Wong I'm

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,649
eating's on Twitter and this is my

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,960
partner in crime Brian Wald yeah we both

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,100
are solutions architects todavia and

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,750
we've been sleeping for the last four

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,199
days in an Airstream trailer on East

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,210
Austin so most of these ideas came from

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,160
you know that that experience so if

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,710
they're a little kooky blame the

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,120
airstream before we start let's take a

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,330
show of hands here who here considers

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,830
themselves a front-end person okay a

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,360
better question who here consider

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,830
certain does not consider themselves a

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,430
front-end person ok ok don't be

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,430
something for you too

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,240
might have to wait till the end but but

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,119
there'll be something for you here so

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,579
sort of the the gist of this entire you

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,670
know our thesis is front-end developers

00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:31,170
are expected to know a lot and i'm

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,729
guessing the majority of you out here

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,070
who are doing front-end would not

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:38,850
disagree with this statement no really

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,710
they're expected to know a lot here's a

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,179
representative far side cartoon for

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,729
those of us who are old enough to

00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:46,470
remember far side being in the newspaper

00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:49,020
there's a child with a particularly

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:53,159
small head saying mr. Osborn may be

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,709
excused my brain is full and this is

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,899
sort of the the general feeling that a

00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:59,720
lot of folks that I've talked to both of

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,830
us have talked to have expressed about

00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,599
what's happening to the state of the web

00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,119
especially in the front end and you know

00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,390
how one's career or one's job might fit

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,799
into it I'm going to read a quote oh

00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:15,090
jesus what as well as that your father

00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:16,530
no it's not okay there's a quote from

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,709
Frank Camaro who here knows who Frank

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,709
Camaro is the designer okay not not not

00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:24,900
a few of you Frank Camaro is a print and

00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,130
web and interactive designer of no small

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,510
renowned he's worked for you know if you

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,910
look at his client list it's really big

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,829
and he has a very popular blog and he's

00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,019
an ace designer but this was a blog post

00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:36,480
he wrote you know less than a month ago

00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:39,510
and the quote is it's time to come clean

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,310
github is confusing get is confusing her

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,840
pretty much everything in a modern web

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,640
stack no longer makes sense to me and

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,350
nobody explains it well because they

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,060
assume I know some fundamental piece of

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,400
information that everyone takes for

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,230
granted and no one documented almost if

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,569
there was a secret spread around to most

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,910
everyone sometime in 2012 yet I somehow

00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:58,530
missed because you know life was

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,030
happening to me so I've given up on

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,560
trying to understand even the parts

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,450
where I try to comprehend what everyone

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,340
else is working on that warrants that

00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,530
kind of complexity and now I fear that

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,090
makes me irrelevant so I'm nestled close

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,370
to the story that my value is in my

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,680
quote ideas and capability to quote make

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,569
sense of things even though I can't make

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,819
sense of any of the above but really

00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:21,910
maybe I'm doing okay because it's all

00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:24,410
too much to know let the kids have it

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,970
and you know it up just let me put it

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:30,860
this way Frank Camaro is under the age

00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:32,480
of 35 yeah so this is not an old man you

00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,190
know shaving his neck beard you know

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:39,020
talking about the web this is this is

00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:43,040
somebody our age or possibly younger so

00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,970
how did we get here this is just a

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,489
warning of this is not going to be a

00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:50,410
very long presentation but we're going

00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:53,450
to take a little short history here so

00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,700
yeah so here's here's here's the code of

00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:59,660
Drupal 7 alpha 1 which released on

00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:02,930
January 15 2010 and this is where we are

00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,459
drupalcon SF was happening in april 2010

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,690
and i just wanted to point out let's

00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:08,959
take a look at some of those tracks that

00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:11,750
are happening in 2010 so we have things

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,819
like you know theme process preprocess

00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:17,930
functions we have things like a jQuery

00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:19,489
for designers you know PSD's to HTML

00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,440
like that was a thing that we were doing

00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:22,910
back then you know we were learning

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,410
about typography and all these things

00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:26,479
like that these are things that we would

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,979
consider as you know as femurs we were

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,330
considered you know these were things

00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:30,830
that we had to kind of just figure out

00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,620
because things were moving so fast and

00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,810
we wanted to you know take a look at

00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,370
what was the next possibility and so

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,930
then so then let's take a look at the

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,100
next year and what I'm what I'm trying

00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,810
to point out here is let's take a look

00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,789
at the tracks here okay so we have a

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,460
track for theming in this year in

00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:48,169
Chicago we also had a track for design

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,479
and ux and look at all the rest of the

00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:52,220
tracks you know you have pretty much

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,530
standard this has been the same tracks

00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,300
for the last five years every other one

00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,030
has been very very similar in terms of

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,010
development DevOps so and so forth and

00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:03,140
so then denver happened and suddenly

00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,090
changed again now we have mobile now we

00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,250
have a design view acts the theming one

00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,110
went away you know we don't we don't

00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,510
have a front-end track and then and then

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,190
we jump forward to today so i skipped

00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,080
one year but you know you get the idea

00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,700
so let's take a look at now so we don't

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,930
have that theming one anymore we don't

00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,090
have the mobile one anymore now we have

00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,650
a front-end one and we have aux1 and

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,870
it's just one of those things that's

00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,070
just changed so much but all the other

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,780
tracks have stayed pretty much the same

00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,009
so we have to adapt every year and

00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,960
everything's changing every

00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:32,509
and it's not even just like simple

00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,180
components the entire basis of what we

00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:36,710
do has changed over these years and in

00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,020
short nobody knows where to put us right

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,219
now we have a front-end track now maybe

00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,229
it's better maybe it isn't maybe we'll

00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:43,399
go away next year but you know over the

00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:45,349
last five years there hasn't been any

00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:46,610
consistency and where this sort of thing

00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:48,649
that we're going to talk about has sad

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,960
and there's confusion throughout the

00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:52,430
Drupal universe in among the developers

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,800
and the community at large about what

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,659
kind of role front-end plays and what

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,009
kind of skill set go with it and it's

00:05:56,659 --> 00:06:00,439
the kind of thing we're going to talk

00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:02,089
about today in a presentation so the

00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:03,469
state of the web as Drupal 7 was

00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:05,120
released you know this is four years ago

00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:07,039
drupal 7 this is currently the

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,749
still-active version of Drupal that

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,969
we've been working with up to this point

00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:15,020
when it launched or when it was released

00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:16,879
rather in 2010 ie 786 at fifty-six

00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,279
percent market share who remembers this

00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,139
kind of thing no I i e six support

00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,539
wasn't like a joke or an add-on fee it

00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:25,159
was a thing you know and no one was

00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:27,499
thinking about mobile yeah and then two

00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:31,240
percent no money right what was mobile

00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:31,240
my my pager was mobile you know

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,430
everybody loved static CSS grid

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,230
frameworks a shout out to massimo

remembers blueprint CSS drupal.org was

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,990
originally prototyped against Brooklyn

00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:59,890
CSS and to my knowledge still is based

00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:01,870
on its grid who remembers 960 GS there

00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:05,890

too long ago aces that was it and if you

00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,050
want to do something else it was going

00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,970
to look like this you have to inject

00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,100
flash into your site that was not

00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,900
highlight able and you had to use these

00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,820
crazy tags and you were like oh what

00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,230
happens about this SEO and all kinds of

00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,550
crazy stuff just to get some different

00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:34,150
fonts to show up and then it didn't work

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,620
unlike mobile so there's that when

00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,740
Drupal 7 launched we had competing

00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:41,890
JavaScript libraries this was an active

00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:44,550
question at the time whoo-hoo vrs built

00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:46,810
anything on mood tools or prototype ever

00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:51,900
all right so it's a dude what about the

00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,900
last two years exactly I'd hope that

00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,140
this was an open question and I'm glad

00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,340
Morton's in this room because i was

00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,080
thinking of him when i said when i read

00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,790
with this slide the need for front

00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,160
enters to learn version control was

00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:05,590
still an object of active debate as

00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,510
recently as the launch of drupal 7 it

00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,100
wasn't you know maybe Famers don't have

00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,300
to learn version control maybe just get

00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,700
away with doing what they were doing at

00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,870
TP yeah you know like what why would

00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,540
they need a reversion their code you

00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:19,810
know that sort of thing um the ability

00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:21,850
to maybe possibly use css3 was a major

00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,260
point of contention like oh I don't know

00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,970
about this progressive enhancement thing

00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,250
you know like you know the you know

00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:29,470
these cut-up sprites are working pretty

00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,390
good for us you know and and rounded

00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:32,830
corners were really cool so you had to

00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:35,050
do that and how are you going to do that

00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:37,479
with those images in the corners like

00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:39,280
this shouldn't pray lifetime of Drupal 7

00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:40,810
the same stack we were using before all

00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,200
these assumptions are still in place and

00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,470
so the Drupal front end during this time

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,080
you

00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:49,000
a quote femur who you're still describes

00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,650
themselves as a femur you know it either

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,660
in title on their card or by other

00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:58,240
people okay okay okay the morn you don't

00:08:52,660 --> 00:09:00,070
count so this is you know your title

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,120
might be something fancy other people

00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,570
might have used a different title for

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,010
you you know in 2009-2010 and maybe this

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,990
is the way that you use describe

00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,970
yourself but the greater Drupal

00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:12,100
community acknowledges you as a femur

00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,070
and a themer with that comes you know

00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:17,290
with theming comes a certain set of

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:20,710
implicit definitions which will go to in

00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:22,480
a little bit at the time when Drupal 7

00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,920
launched this is your media query you

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,050
have style sure that you would know

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,030
things I print your print media style

00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:31,300
sheet injected into the info file this

00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:33,250
is a media query this is your style

00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,430
sheet writing really really long

00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:38,620
selectors in line and and hoping that

00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:43,500
targets the right you know h2 in your

00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:45,390
views and this was your job

00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,850
this is what you were doing this is what

00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,650
people thought of you as okay so we

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,950
finished our application now now hand it

00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:55,830
off and they'll make this HTML to make

00:09:52,950 --> 00:10:00,450
sites that look like this or this or

00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:02,340
this that's the state of Drupal when

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:05,340
Drupal 7 launched and the state of the

00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,630
front end so what's happened and I'm

00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,890
sure a lot of you have different

00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,930
experience about what's happened but

00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,610
we'll cover sore when it happened or

00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,630
would it happened right but it happened

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,530
a little differently for everybody I

00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:17,940
guess right so html5 and css3 happened

00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,440
you know that was a big thing that's

00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,120
that was a big game-changer for

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,130
everything that we just talked about you

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,650
know no longer happening to slice up

00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:27,690
your PSD s and you know insert columns

00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,310
for various different images to make

00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,350
them rounded corners you could you could

00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,660
use that in CSS and it was probably okay

00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,730
because because the browser for changing

00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,920
you know people were we're using

00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,690
browsers for the most part that were

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,610
advanced enough to handle these types of

00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,440
things they they had this built-in you

00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,560
know we were progressing and moving away

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,670
from the static HTML pages to

00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,590
applications that could be rendered in

00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:52,530
the DOM and be handled and do things

00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,640
like this in a more efficient way I want

00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,080
to put out this little inflection point

00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:59,180
that the blue line is ie in the green

00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:01,590
line is chrome that was a very happy day

00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:04,530
that actually happened and I think 2013

00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:08,040
so a lot of them like it'll thing now

00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,630
you know whatever mobile happened I

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,130
think this goes without saying like I'm

00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:13,130
sure every single one of you in this

00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,180
room has the dies in their pocket that's

00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,430
directly responsible for changing the

00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,710
front-end landscape in our industry and

00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:22,610
can you continues to use it you know

00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:26,160
that's not going to way so that led to

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:28,740
em down sights oh here's built an m dot

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,690
sight yeah you're still building an m

00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,650
dot sight oh thank god oh oh

00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,650
congratulations

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:40,290
which led to mobile web apps who hears

00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,550
build a site on jQuery Mobile oh here's

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,750
bill decide on something like Jake for

00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,850
your mobile something that faked up your

00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,560
your site protect gestures and all those

00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,580
types of things up guys on the back

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,920
there's more seats in the front if you'd

00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:52,890
like come on down yeah price is right

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,080
you know I'm close now huh adaptive

00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:57,120
websites who hears built an adaptive

00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:00,000
website it's like that that fixed with

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,029
on a different device okay and then just

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,220
a little over exactly four years ago the

00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:06,510
twenty-fifth of may I think it was this

00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,300
article was published who your

00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,830
recognizes what this article is yeah so

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,690
this is the original ether mark coat

00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,150
article on a list apart describing

00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,380
responsive web design and this in

00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,150
addition to mobile more than anything

00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:21,630
has completely shattered the game when

00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:23,070
it comes to front end and this idea of

00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,770
progressive enhancement which I thought

00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:27,990
was total BS you know before you know

00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:30,630
before mobile and responsive came out

00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:33,480
he's totally a thing like a capital T

00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,620
thing this is this isn't just a buzzword

00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,230
that's known about progressive

00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,750
enhancement it is an actual practice

00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:42,120
that is alive and well and even standard

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:44,880
today and before all the tools that was

00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,959
you know really hard to do yeah that's

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,339
something that was just you could just

00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:49,140
do because you had something that was

00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:50,790
going to make it easy for you it was

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,950
like you had to spell everything now you

00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:55,560
had to use browser prefixes you had to

00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:57,510
do all kinds of crazy stuff so let's

00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,120
pause for a second to consider here this

00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:02,220
all this change happened during Drupal 7

00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,350
s lifetime hell it's still Drupal 7 s

00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,810
lifetime all this happened and drupal 7

00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:09,779
the tarball you download opera triple or

00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:13,440
the git repo you clone off of get

00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:15,060
drupal.org the same software none of it

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,580
has changed all the assumptions that

00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:20,430
went into making Drupal 7 the Drupal 7

00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:22,620
core are still there pre all these

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:24,120
revolutionary things and we're still

00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,650
building something I want to point out

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,700
it's not like a blame thing that this

00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,740
hasn't changed it's just one of those

00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,150
things that you you know I don't think

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,130
people were quite prepared for how

00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,810
quickly things moved i think in earlier

00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,700
i was i was watching one of angie's

00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:37,690
speeches and she said you could take any

00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,720
word in the dictionary and add j

00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:43,210
to it you have a project you know so you

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,190
know the at this time it was it was

00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,420
something that you know we didn't know

00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,950
how it's going to change and how quickly

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,020
things had and what kind of fads were

00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,310
going to come and go and you know people

00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,930
were just trying to make the best of

00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,660
what their situation was because it

00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:57,780
sucked mostly so meanwhile the rest of

00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:00,280
the web world that is outside of Drupal

00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:02,950
Ruby's taken off right you know and

00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,810
rails and opinionated frameworks and all

00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:07,210
these other web frameworks that you can

00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:10,060
build viable websites web applications

00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:11,590
out of increase in popularity and they

00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,630
have their own way of doing things which

00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,950
is and many times diametrically opposed

00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,450
to the way Drupal does things and

00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,740
there's an entire ecosystem of people

00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,180
that are used to building things a

00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,630
different way with a different

00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,760
perspective um JavaScript became cool

00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,740
again I'm JavaScript when I was in

00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,450
college was like what the hell like it

00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,790
makes things blink you know like the

00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,920
like JavaScript suddenly is the cool

00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,960
language since everybody already knows

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:39,520
eight let's just use it everywhere right

00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:43,240
so in the back end on the front end for

00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:45,490
automation for even more automation for

00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,960
managing your packages and what the hell

00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:50,690
for everything

00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,340
no but you know javascript is still

00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,780
JavaScript and if you guys seen the book

00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,880
right this is the the definitive

00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,350
JavaScript guide and this is JavaScript

00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,090
the good parts which is like a quarter

00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:02,300
of the size so maybe javascript isn't

00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:03,290
awesome after all so let's write a meta

00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,230
language that compiles down to

00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:10,190
javascript who's used coffee script here

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:13,760
before okay the same idea with copy

00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:16,970
script um sure let's do with HTML who's

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,800
ridden hamill before yeah yeah okay and

00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,390
get ill with more tests it's much much

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,370
more larger audience here for this one

00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:25,340
so you know things like SAS come into

00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:27,650
play and things like glass and things

00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,360
like stylist now you know that was the

00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:32,090
thing for a little while but still you

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,410
know it's still kind of but but the

00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,910
point is you know that it was one of

00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:36,170
these things that we've gotten to this

00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,390
point where we're like okay we have to

00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:40,010
get some sort of tools to make this

00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:41,900
manageable there's just too much we're

00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:43,760
dealing with too much of a an

00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,830
inconsistency across all the browser

00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,210
stacks off OS and everything like that

00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:49,820
so we started doing all these things

00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:51,710
that make it more manageable and take

00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,960
carrying all the the tedious annoying

00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:57,080
pieces of it everybody's came about

00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:59,900
frameworks and then libraries on top of

00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:02,110
frameworks then libraries on top of

00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,910
libraries on top of frameworks

00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:07,940
frameworks for layouts frameworks for

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:10,070
buttons you get the idea there's a lot

00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,610
of stuff and there's stuff on top of

00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:18,470
stuff and stop on top of top of stuff

00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:20,150
but still I'll eat this from series have

00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,440
you ever heard anyone say that you know

00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,520
wind it up when they're standing over

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,100
your shoulder does that this looks like

00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,690
a Drupal site you know you probably

00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,640
heard that once or twice before and it's

00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,990
because you know well let's take a

00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,970
little to kiss step back and think about

00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,250
why that happens well it's because you

00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:35,660
know Drupal framework had dictated the

00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,280
design patterns you know they had

00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,740
injected these design patterns that show

00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,300
up on every display layer on every

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,560
Drupal site one way or another I mean

00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:46,100
how many of you spent so much time

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,750
taking out pieces from Drupal to make it

00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,460
display better you know you look like it

00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,720
informs you of all those things you

00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,130
spend so much time doing that and you're

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,990
like why

00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:57,820
doing this it's like how do i bill a

00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:59,170
client for taking away things and so so

00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,570
you got output methods from default

00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:02,710
stylings which I dis mentioned and you

00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,970
might have things that you know look

00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,470
like this these are some of the design

00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,240
patterns that came about and you have

00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:09,550
menus you know that looked like this one

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,430
and you have forms that look like this

00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,449
and so you know we're trying to where

00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,949
essentially what we're doing here is

00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,449
we're solving for an entirely new

00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:18,940
universe at this point you know entirely

00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:20,380
new use cases everything is changing

00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,120
rapidly and people want things to look

00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:24,430
different than your standard you know

00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,350
stock Drupal site but we're still

00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:30,400
dealing with the same Drupal

00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:32,410
from Drupal 6 the birth of Drupal 7 and

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,570
Drupal 7 again like we said has not

00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,950
changed from the day was launched to now

00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,810
and we're still dealing with this no

00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:40,210
matter what the added expectations on

00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:41,860
top mobile responsive whatever are

00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,380
layered on top of it we're still dealing

00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,700
with the same drupal I don't

00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,040
know if this is accurate now but this is

00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:51,490
the 72nd sly and so we're actually going

00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,650
to slow down here now but we've gone

00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:56,020
through 72 slides and we still haven't

00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:57,970
covered performance touch contextual

00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,770

00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,990
designing in the browser live

00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,060
prototyping a/b testing the list goes on

00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,920
right all of these things sessions on

00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:11,050
the mid triple quadruple con now you

00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,700
hear you hear these words you know these

00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:14,140
practices exist you read Smashing

00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,320
Magazine and you know somebody's doing

00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:20,500
it you probably ought to learn it we're

00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:23,140
not we you know you get the point my

00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,130
brain is full right that's that's it I'm

00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,560
getting off the train you know going to

00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,940
be a print designer now um you know what

00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,420
is that you know what I have thought

00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:33,280
about that weapons hot um so one of

00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:36,370
these ideas that we want to want it to

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:40,930
present today is that front end is its

00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:44,320
own thing and it's not it's not a subset

00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:45,670
or an extension of design or an

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,290
afterthought or an afterthought

00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:49,360
absolutely or a place to put your junior

00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,100
designers or developers rather front end

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,890
is a thing it's a thing that's complete

00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,150
with its own software stack it's a thing

00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:58,150
that's complete with its own tooling

00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:59,920
best practices and testing and it's a

00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,780
thing that's complete with its own skill

00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,180
set that's is unique to front end as

00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,950
back-end skills at the back end

00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,940
and to treat it as anything less would

00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:11,640
be unfair to both sides of the equation

00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:14,670
so it's as complex and as diverse as the

00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:19,260
back end and taking that into account

00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:21,390
the old rules do not apply yeah it's no

00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,160
longer about you know styling the output

00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,540
and giving it from from the blackened

00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,070
developer just spit something out and

00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,600
says good luck you know throws it over

00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:30,090
the fence we can't think that way

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,560
anymore I think that you know at the

00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:33,030
birth of you know where you X became a

00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,200
really big thing in the web that kind of

00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,390
changed a little bit you know with the

00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,830
wire framing in and the user testing and

00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,180
managing all these things in the early

00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,160
stages so that they weren't doing that

00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,270
which was a big problem but it still

00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,430
happens you know there's still that

00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:46,260
there's that notion of well what we'll

00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,580
deal with how this looks later but we

00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,320
just have to get it functioning and

00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,400
that's and that's not really the way

00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,760
that we should be thinking about this

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,230
and the front end isn't a place to put

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,670
your junior developers until they get

00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:59,580
good enough to be module developers

00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:00,660
we're here started here as a themer no

00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,280
matter what your level of skill or your

00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,780
thing you came in and you were just a

00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,160
basic theme or you like as a junior

00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:09,110
developer of course steaming is what you

00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:12,120
did who you're started in like this is

00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:15,450
it's where people started where you put

00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:18,480
them and so we want to suggest is about

00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:21,180
changing the process the way front-end

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,920
development is done about equal footing

00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,180
in determining application architecture

00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,740
front end isn't the thing you think

00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:28,470
about second after you get all your

00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,510
internals done and that front end is

00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,700
performed and practice with as much

00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:34,830
rigor and maturity as the back end

00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,330
because front end is as mature as the

00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,100
back end now the kind of software we're

00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,780
building the kind of applications were

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,400
building on top of the back end are as

00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:47,070
complex as those in the back end itself

00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,540
so a Drupal release Loretta cycle is

00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,560
long which is a good thing it's a really

00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,180
good thing you know it means that we

00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,560
have a mature software means that people

00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,170
are utilizing it means it's being

00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:58,080
adopted and it's being adopted across

00:20:55,170 --> 00:21:00,740
all types of verticals but the thing is

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,630
though multiple front end production

00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,160
frameworks have been come and gone

00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:08,190
during this time period of the span of

00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,810
Drupal so you know we've had all kinds

00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,370
of things that have started out at the

00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,650
same time Drupal did and then went away

00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,810
before now or starting now and we

00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:18,120
have to somehow retrofit that to work

00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:20,130
with Drupal and make that you know bend

00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,770
into that and mounted so you can

00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:25,080
actually use those things we need to be

00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:26,730
more able to readily adapt Drupal to

00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,490
front end technologies as they emerge

00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:31,680
again triple now been completely

00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:33,240
agnostic to it Drupal is a agnostic but

00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,410
also opinionated and I think that's also

00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,340
the problem but we'll talk about that in

00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:40,380
a second yeah so here's a slide of

00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:43,140
triple sevens lifetime you know x axis

00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,210
year so yeah so we what we did is we

00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,830
just looked at you know when when did

00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,450
these these frameworks come in we will

00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,070
we looked for the first commit and get

00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,780
and said this is when they started and

00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:53,670
you know this is approximately how long

00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,530
they were adopted so you know Drupal 7

00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:57,390
has spanned all that and will it will be

00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,830
a readily available for the next few

00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:00,600
years as production environments and

00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:02,100
that's a great thing but look what's

00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,020
come and gone in that time period you

00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,850
know you have all of your here CSS

00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:09,180
frameworks you have angular coming in at

00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:11,880
that point 960 died off jquery mobile

00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,920
like kind of still there but it's going

00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,930
away and then you've got you know grunt

00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,130
coming in and coo fund has gone at you

00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,720
know started during the middle of the

00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:21,120
process and it died out at some point

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:25,170
and so you know what we were looking at

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:27,360
is so when you look at this back half of

00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:29,190
it when we start a Drupal 7 how would we

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,300
possibly ever expect what this is going

00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,650
to look like we don't know what the

00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,170
landscape of the front end is going to

00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,640
look like at that point and vice versa

00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,870
when we started out we were like okay

00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,460
let's build this for these frame

00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,720
frameworks that's cool this is a cool

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,430
thing right now let's let's make sure

00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,870
that these work really well and so we

00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:46,500
built those and those lasted and the

00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:48,180
other ones were kind of shadowed away so

00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,890
the takeaway from that is we're never

00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,600
going to know what's going to come it's

00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,740
going to come and and it's going to take

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,910
us all by surprise and it's going to be

00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,050
the next biggest thing and the things

00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,120
that we've bet on now that are going to

00:22:55,050 --> 00:23:00,210
be awesome are going to die without our

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,910
say-so you know without asking us we

00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:04,860
need to make Drupal more take apart a

00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:06,120
bowl and we use the word take apart a

00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,890
bowl instead of decoupled because

00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,600
decoupled is a word that has a lot of

00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,740
implications you know when you say to a

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,960
couple people start thinking you know

00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,150
like this very specific angular thing no

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,660
it needs to be more take apart a bowl

00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:20,490
though the we need triple to be this

00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:22,830
thing where we can build the thing we

00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,420
want versus just clobbering and

00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,000
chiseling away at your bowl to get it

00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,170
close to what we really

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,270
on it we want to build the thing we

00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:33,410
really want not not the thing that most

00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:34,850
closely approximates it um yeah so I so

00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,530
one of these things that I was thinking

00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:38,360
about is that we kind of need to build

00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:40,660
our front end to be to be resilient to

00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,700
that and I say resilient in the way like

00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,350
not not like you know we have to make it

00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,970
something that doesn't do anything at

00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:49,870
all but just kind of last forever I mean

00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:53,270
I mean resilient in terms of you know

00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:55,190
being able to have like some sort of

00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,840
barrier in between that in the back end

00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:58,790
of Drupal and the front end of it so

00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,680
that we don't have to have these really

00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,450
painful middle points you know we don't

00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,220
have to have these these connector

00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,960
pieces to get what you want to do on the

00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:09,350
front end to work inside of a Drupal

00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:11,510
site because the next big change is

00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:14,060
going to happen whether we say so or not

00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:16,240
it's going to happen and it's going to

00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:18,680
hit rupal and Drupal has to be ready

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:22,070
look at Drupal's not a thing okay we

00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:24,170
have to be ready to work with it or walk

00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,180
away from it or do something else

00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,680
because we simply can't just say sit pat

00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:30,980
working on the technologies of today

00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,780
three years from now and so here's a

00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,430
little fancy slide of how such a thing

00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,520
might exist we're certainly not Gore

00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:38,450
developers but this is an idea yeah

00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,310
that's a good point i want to put that

00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:42,230
for it is like a final statement of how

00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:44,360
we think it would ever look but you know

00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:46,910
it's just that idea of we have to kind

00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,710
of think about how do we how do we plan

00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:50,780
for the future without knowing what the

00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:53,180
future is and that's a really hard thing

00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:55,280
to do but you know it's the only way

00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,660
that with as we saw through all these

00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,950
slides how everything's changed so fast

00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,510
we know that that's only going to get

00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,760
faster and if only again if people have

00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:03,860
their fads and whatever else is going to

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,280
come next for how they want to display

00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:08,630
their media their sites so maybe this is

00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,170
maybe this is some way that you could do

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,760
that think about it at least so I hope

00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:15,410
you guys weren't coming here for a

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,640
definitive answer like yes this is how

00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,020
you manage your skills all the way to

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,140
the end and this is the track you need

00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,920
to go part of it is that well I sure as

00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,300
hell don't know what's going to happen

00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,430
in the next two years with any certainty

00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,020
else I you know I wouldn't be up here

00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:31,460
I'd be placing you know bets at the

00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:33,500
stock exchange and at the same time we

00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,120
can clearly see from the trend path of

00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,410
Drupal 7 that these kind of changes are

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,330
going to happen they're going to take us

00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,350
mostly by surprise and we're going to

00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:41,480
ketchup and we're going to try to show

00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:43,820
things into Drupal and we might not be

00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,720
entirely successful in it and the goal

00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:49,429
is that for Drupal to be successful we

00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,100
need these front-end technologies to be

00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:53,510
more readily the front-end ripal has to

00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,789
play ball with these funded technologies

00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:58,250
whatever they may be as they come up and

00:25:55,789 --> 00:26:01,549
what it what if that exactly means to

00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:03,649
make Drupal more ball playable that's a

00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:05,120
greater question and I think that I

00:26:03,649 --> 00:26:06,740
think the thing is we don't you what it

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,720
is more is you don't want Drupal to be

00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:11,450
opinionated you know it has to be you

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,120
know somewhat agnostic to to the future

00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:16,580
of the front end because you know Drupal

00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,769
is not a front end per se you know it's

00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:21,080
it's a piece that can bubble up to that

00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:22,730
point but in work with that very well it

00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,260
can give you all the information and

00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,789
data you want and allow you to input in

00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,190
two thousand different ways and just you

00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:30,710
know and query it out however it has to

00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:33,169
happen but that that piece of it is is

00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:38,750
is very confusing and very hard to work

00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:40,100
with with the current state so one I did

00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:44,000
expect this many people to show up so

00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:46,460
thank you all for coming to the we

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,440
figured there'd be a lot of questions

00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:51,440
and/or discussion around this and we're

00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,789
happy to talk about this and if you guys

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,440
think we're totally full of crap please

00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:56,659
let us know too there's a mic in the

00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,039
back and please somebody other than

00:26:56,659 --> 00:27:00,039
Morton be the first person because

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:09,450
no no no no dr. people stood up

00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:11,610
beautiful setup hi I'm Peter I know so

00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:12,900
so I'm very happy to see this session

00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:16,950
this is what I've been preaching for

00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:18,809
about six years in jewel that we've have

00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:22,230
a developer community who have been

00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:24,780
building drupal foss as fun tenders and

00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:26,360
what happened when you do that you ask

00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,650
your pack and developers to build a

00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,980
fontaine technology they don't care

00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:34,890
about not interest them has no relevance

00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,770
for them in the day-to-day work and we

00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:39,750
can choose to do that also interpolate

00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:41,970
we can just lean back and wait and hope

00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:44,130
they will give us something that we then

00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:45,600
hopefully a rather we will end up in the

00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,780
same development sort of where we cannot

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,370
do anything on it and so the logical

00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,010
answer to that is we have a coach

00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:54,690
control and you're all funded us and we

00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:57,540
need your opinions because right now

00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:59,220
we're like five or six coders who's

00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:02,220
trying to fix all of these things and

00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,110
make it work in a way that we can

00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,390
actually take over our front-end that's

00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:08,760
one of our cold well trick what we want

00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:11,610
to do but we need more manpower and

00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,799
female power and geek power and design

00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:17,730
power and those who X is going to use it

00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:19,919
and so the point is that all everything

00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,450
you solving this screen at how pretty

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,250
much the whole front end ran us over

00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:25,230
that's going to happen again in two

00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:27,720
years if you don't come in and help out

00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:29,549
so it's actually you look at yourself is

00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,650
that a choice you're going to take if

00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:35,250
you don't step up that's the choice you

00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:37,320
too you take so it's kind of a call to

00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,549
arms it's now or never this is the first

00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,410
time we had the chance to clear

00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:42,960
everything out of fuel and make it new

00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:44,070
and actually change this action this is

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,640
the first time you're more than one

00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:49,850
funding in the issue queue for realz we

00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,049
actually happen community around it so

00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,220
when you go home tonight and you figure

00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:55,049
out if you want to go to the code sprint

00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,490
well take a look at the mirror in the

00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:58,440
morning and say do I want to have a

00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:02,700
front end that's going to be run over if

00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:04,799
you want to have that don't show up so

00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:08,610
what makes a good point here in that

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:10,260
Drupal 8 is still it's somewhat in flux

00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:11,380
and that the direction that Drupal 8

00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,500
takes and things is to

00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:16,150
up to us to determine and the people

00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,220
like us in the room who do have strong

00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,600
opinions about things out how fun it

00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,820
ought to be whether it be you know

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,430
decoupled or not can still influence

00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:27,670
this decision going forward yeah I think

00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:29,410
that also don't be discouraged because

00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:30,850
we are in the right direction with

00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:32,170
Drupal 8 you know there are a lot of

00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:34,750
things go in the right direction in

00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:36,070
terms of you know managing our libraries

00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:39,100
in the front end so we don't have to

00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:40,270
require jquery as our only JavaScript

00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,590
framework we can do whatever we want

00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:43,180
with that those are the direction that

00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:45,520
it is going right now it just needs some

00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:47,080
extra push so you know you're not

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,790
starting from scratch people are people

00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:53,050
are on this and this is the direction

00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:55,780
that it is going thank you for doing

00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:57,910
this this has been probably one of the

00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:59,650
awesomest presentations I've been to

00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:01,540
thank you throughout this whole thing

00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:05,440
Thank You reason why well as soon as I

00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:08,320
get back all of my bosses are going to

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:11,340
watch this ya know total they can

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:15,130
understand the situation I feel that and

00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:18,010
I'm I'm I might speak for many other

00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:19,900
people here as a front-end developer

00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:23,080
it's kind of where do we fit in with the

00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:25,780
rest of Drupal yes there's they're sort

00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:28,170
of this disambiguation between site

00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:31,300
builders and front-end developers and

00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:32,950
it's often times we wonder where do we

00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,420
as front end designers really fit into

00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:37,330
the greater Drupal thing how do we

00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:39,520
really contribute back and this was a

00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:42,490
this is a really really big point that

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,350
our role and the challenges that we're

00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:46,960
facing are much larger than anybody

00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:49,960
actually gives credit for absolutely

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,510
anywhere close to it and so if we really

00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,560
are going to continue doing what it is

00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:56,500
that we're doing and we're going to

00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,690
continue using Drupal as as the the

00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:01,450
background behind what we do then we

00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:04,060
really do need to get involved and we

00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:06,340
really do need to contribute back and

00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:10,840
make our voices heard that the

00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:11,770
presentation layer the back end is going

00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,000
to be what it's going to be and

00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:15,430
everything but if we don't have a good

00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,440
presentation layer if it doesn't have

00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:21,300
that aesthetic quality it's not going to

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,300
be successful thank you

00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,860
hi so the couple I think it was on

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,250
Wednesday there was a session talking

00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:31,480
about object-oriented code specifically

00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:33,100
working with Twiggy and doing some of

00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,350
the really cool stuff that Drupal 8

00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,610
can't do yet with twig and more

00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,169
importantly what I was noticing is that

00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:39,399
it it seems like with Drupal 8 we're

00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:41,980
going to have a much better separation

00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:43,000
between that PHP code and our front-end

00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,399
so our front-end will gets the attention

00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,110
that it deserves as opposed to having to

00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:50,740
teach all my designers how to navigate

00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:53,080
an array so is there is a part of

00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:54,429
keeping Drupal relevant from a front-end

00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,809
perspective because as you saw I mean

00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:58,000
we've somehow managed to survive for

00:31:55,809 --> 00:32:00,850
years of very rapid change in the front

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,919
end world do you think that the new REST

00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:04,659
API features and maybe an expansion of

00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:06,460
that could be could go a long way

00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:08,679
towards giving us the flexibility we

00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,759
need so that when angularjs turns into

00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:11,590
something else and we have some other

00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:13,240
crazy think we're supposed to use that

00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:15,759
the data is still there we can always

00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:19,149
work with it that's kind of decision

00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,980
yeah well you go first well I was just

00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:22,690
gonna say I think that that the idea of

00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:25,029
having a restful api and just being able

00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:27,279
to you know spit out whatever they want

00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:28,779
the data to be on the to the front end

00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,269
and what else manipulate that how we

00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:33,519
want is ultimately kind of the right

00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:36,190
direction for that there's two pieces of

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:39,610
that though you know you can't just that

00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:41,350
that will shadow a lot of people by

00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:43,840
doing that entirely you know we can't

00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:45,700
just say here's here's some stuff good

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,860
luck you know I hope you I hope you know

00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,269
how to do all these frameworks and build

00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:51,820
them from scratch because you know

00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:53,350
that's hard too so it has there I think

00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,720
that twig is a really good compromise in

00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:58,120
that way and helps you know people being

00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,190
able to use twig that aren't experienced

00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,659
in PHP but still can get the proper

00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,129
layouts and without you know the

00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:04,840
security problems that they might run

00:33:03,129 --> 00:33:07,029
into by doing something strange that

00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,580
they copied from a blog for instance so

00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:11,799
you know I think that that is that is a

00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:14,529
good point that having the RESTful API

00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:16,389
is going to be a huge player and giving

00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:18,879
us the data that we need to do out and

00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:21,220
manipulate how we want I was going to

00:33:18,879 --> 00:33:23,679
say you guys should come to my decoupled

00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:26,529
Drupal ball yesterday but that wouldn't

00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:29,649
help at all um but no seriously the

00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:31,320
decoupled Drupal headless Drupal the

00:33:29,649 --> 00:33:34,290
personal opinion wave of the future

00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:37,710
absolutely yep

00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:40,740
I have a favor to ask sure uh Yoda slide

00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:42,120
yeah it said PSD to HTML yeah I didn't

00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:44,100
get a chance to take a photo of it

00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,230
hopefully i'm sure and i know that i

00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:48,420
could go and get the slides for this and

00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:50,340
then show to my bosses and stuff i've

00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:53,160
been working at an agency for about six

00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:55,440
months and their process is still this

00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,570
and i feel that they're not really

00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,040
listening to me and i find that i'm

00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:00,600
gonna have to give a presentation from

00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,760
what I learned here at drupalcon and I

00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,850
would love to end my presentation of a

session of drupalcon guys we're told you

00:34:52,110 --> 00:35:01,820
know I'm going straight to the bar after

00:34:54,330 --> 00:35:07,040
this so okay on three right 101 one two

00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:07,040

next all right cool yes so cool two

00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:31,710
questions once a quick one one may not

00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:34,620
be sure the quick one is why wasn't this

00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:36,060
on the first day III didn't have any

00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:39,270
trouble schedule we didn't register yeah

00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:41,280
the second one is you guys posted a unit

00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:43,950
had a slide earlier I took a picture of

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:47,340
it yep um it was the quote by Frank

00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:51,360
tomorrow yes yeah github is confusing

00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:53,280
and get is confusing her yep um do you

00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:56,310
have a 30 second explanation of github

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,290
and get because that's yeah it is

00:35:56,310 --> 00:36:01,130
confused I'm not a 30 not a three second

00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:04,140
one um I could give you a 31 but yeah

00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:10,650
after this I'll find me I'll give you a

00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:12,540
30 second one ok come good good so as

00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:14,850
I've gone to the conference I've talked

00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:17,100
to a lot of people with some homer in

00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:19,230
this room and I've gotten to know a lot

00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:22,380
of really cool people now i'm going to

00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:24,840
soapbox for a moment i have the pleasure

00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:30,900
of implementing websites that are given

00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:32,380
to me by PDF wow nice yeah was a new one

00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:38,230
yeah

00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:41,349
I know and you know while I love the

00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:43,359
people I work with at the same time you

00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:48,069
know some of these things happen and

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:50,049
this presentation is kind of inspired me

00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:55,660
and speaking to a lot of people here to

00:36:50,049 --> 00:36:58,569
to you know choose a path forward yep

00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:01,059
yep to you know come together as a

00:36:58,569 --> 00:37:03,789
community and decide what is best but

00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:05,740
how do we do that you know so I think

00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:06,910
one of the things that people III I

00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,819
personally want to inspire everybody

00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:13,000
this value is that in this room is that

00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:15,220
what you do outside of Drupal is not

00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,869
unusual you come to Drupal the Drupal

00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,970
world and you're kind of like this miss

00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:21,940
shapen thing right here you're you're

00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:24,430
the ugly duckling in the world outside

00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:26,559
of Drupal people with engineering skills

00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:29,049
doing front end it's totally effing

00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:30,339
normal like you go to a node meet up

00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:33,099
sometime go to a ruby meet up sometime

00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:34,450
like everybody is just like you well

00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:36,190
maybe they don't look like you but you

00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:37,569
know like their skill set is just like

00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,950
you it's only in this weird Drupal

00:37:37,569 --> 00:37:41,470
universe where the front end is like

00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:43,839
this unusual thing that nobody knows

00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:45,220
what to do with do we have this weird

00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,750
problem like where do we put the front

00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,400
end guy on the cinnamon X to the

00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:51,400
designer or you know sit or next to the

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,700
designer you know there's a greater

00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,470
universe of front-end practice outside

00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,930
the walls of true pole and Drupal would

00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:00,549
do well to look well beyond its internal

00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:02,859
walls to see what's going on out there

00:38:00,549 --> 00:38:03,789
because really drupal's not driving

00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:05,319
front end change you see all those

00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:07,210
technologies they're not native but

00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:09,130
rupal that was other technologies coming

00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:10,660
into Drupal right and when we're not

00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:13,269
pushing change in here we're adopting

00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:14,740
change from other places and if we don't

00:38:13,269 --> 00:38:16,900
want to be left behind we would continue

00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,430
to look beyond our walls and examine why

00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,069
that kind of changes in happening within

00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:22,599
Drupal itself yeah one of the points I

00:38:21,069 --> 00:38:24,549
was going to make earlier that I forgot

00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:26,890
to make was you know when I was talking

00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:28,869
about how Angie said that you know you

00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:31,869
could take a word NAT j/s and you have a

00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:33,400
project on github well that's always a

00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:34,390
critique of front-end developers you

00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,579
know it's one of those things like well

00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:37,930
you guys just spit up something new and

00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:40,150
that's the new thing that everyone uses

00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:42,220
like every two months there's something

00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:43,670
new out there and it that's because it

00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,589
sucks the way that they give

00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:47,569
to us right now you know you have to you

00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:49,160
have to you have to find some new tools

00:38:47,569 --> 00:38:50,839
to make it work and that that's just

00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,059
more of a you know kind of a cry for

00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:55,099
help like hey I need something to make

00:38:53,059 --> 00:38:56,599
this easier for myself because this is

00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,819
taking way too long this is way too

00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:00,770
complex everything's different in every

00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:02,329
different browser and we need something

00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:03,980
to standardize that they have the luxury

00:39:02,329 --> 00:39:06,410
of everything being standardized is it

00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:07,790
run server side that's easy so how do

00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,079
you you know you can't critique that

00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:11,630
because that's something that needs to

00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:12,950
change and everyone's just doing taking

00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,240
their own take of that and I think what

00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,619
you're going to see over time is that's

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,230
not going to happen it's often anymore I

00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:19,220
think that we're starting to stabilize

00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:21,530
various different frameworks that are

00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,640
just work really well so it's starting

00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,140
to get to this point where it's you know

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,400
if you looked at a graph it's kind of a

00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,020
I think it will look more like a bell

00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,880
curve where you started out with nothing

00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:30,349
and then we got like a million different

00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,490
projects and then I think it's going to

00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:32,780
you know those are going to die off

00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:34,520
because they were good ideas and people

00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:36,049
as drap elated about beyond those but

00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,730
it's going to stable out and then

00:39:36,049 --> 00:39:39,829
there's going to be you know some things

00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:41,619
that you're going to use for an extended

00:39:39,829 --> 00:39:45,500
period of time not just two months

00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:50,119
definitely agreed so on to finish up and

00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:51,829
it's rapa mice portion is so as I've

00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:55,369
gotten to know a lot of people and a lot

00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:58,400
of people will say foundation Omega and

00:39:55,369 --> 00:40:02,540
you you know we have a lot of people who

00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:04,760
have their preferred stocks and you know

00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:08,530
and I've had mine but I have SAT and

00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:11,089
listened to every person and every

00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:15,380
person's ideas and theories and

00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:18,670
ideologies and have instead of trying to

00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:22,460
compare nail them against my own I

00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:25,880
decided to just listen and listen and

00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:29,059
and just you know I don't rebuttal with

00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:32,030
them I don't you know I don't compare or

00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:33,140
discuss I just listen and so it's kind

00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,730
of going to say this has worked out

00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:38,240
really well for me I've actually come up

00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:41,180
with a pretty good idea to try with that

00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:45,200
preachers that does with my particular

00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:47,000
situation you know PDFs and you know how

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,670
we could start prototyping how can we

00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,200
move the organization with forward in

00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:54,200
such a way where you're not stepping on

00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,059
people's toes they're not you know up

00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,029
you know you know making people feel

00:40:56,059 --> 00:40:58,259
like they're out

00:40:57,029 --> 00:41:00,529
you know how do how do you bring them

00:40:58,259 --> 00:41:03,179
forward with you so with that in mind

00:41:00,529 --> 00:41:04,979
just one extend to all of you try

00:41:03,179 --> 00:41:07,109
something new try something that you

00:41:04,979 --> 00:41:09,419
haven't done before or just if somebody

00:41:07,109 --> 00:41:11,159
does something different than you listen

00:41:09,419 --> 00:41:13,380
to them without in your mind thinking

00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:17,089
like well why do they do that instead

00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:19,499
just listen and then take it back and

00:41:17,089 --> 00:41:22,650
you know i'll apply it or don't but

00:41:19,499 --> 00:41:23,880
otherwise you know keep an open mind and

00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:32,400
i think that's how we can move forward

00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:34,890
as a group thanks Jerry so um so first

00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,359
let well this is the second session in a

00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:38,789
row now I've gone to where people have

00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:41,869
been talking about front-end design it's

00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:44,669
it's own thing given this big thing so I

00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:46,739
started as a designer and then I was a

00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:49,979
designer themer and then I was a

00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:53,099
designer themer front end or sometimes

00:41:49,979 --> 00:41:56,029
developer you know I've never worked in

00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:58,619
a shop that was big enough where you had

00:41:56,029 --> 00:42:00,329
you know 20 people who could specialize

00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:02,729
and all those different things you know

00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:05,039
it's been me building a site or from

00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:08,609
lucky me and one or two other people

00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:10,919
building a site so are we at the point

00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:14,039
where that can't happen anymore because

00:42:10,919 --> 00:42:17,249
my head is exploding from chervil of

00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:20,339
this stuff yeah is is there a way we

00:42:17,249 --> 00:42:22,650
could get back to that point where the

00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:24,390
tools are good enough and defined enough

00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:28,919
where someone could wrap their head

00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:31,169
around all this yes and no um well I'm

00:42:28,919 --> 00:42:32,309
gonna caveat that by saying if you look

00:42:31,169 --> 00:42:33,569
at the progression of any technology

00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:36,079
that's come up in the 20th century

00:42:33,569 --> 00:42:38,429
that's reached a state of maturity right

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,589
it used to be that anybody and everybody

00:42:38,429 --> 00:42:42,779
could fix their own car because it was

00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:44,219
just that simple right and now not only

00:42:42,779 --> 00:42:46,469
do you have mechanics you have

00:42:44,219 --> 00:42:47,819
specialized mechanics but at the same

00:42:46,469 --> 00:42:49,619
time there are people who are hobbyists

00:42:47,819 --> 00:42:51,269
we're able to fix their own car you know

00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:55,919
including their Tesla if they're if they

00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:58,619
so choose it's a question of personal

00:42:55,919 --> 00:43:01,049
will at some point to whether you want

00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:02,279
to get good at everything I don't think

00:43:01,049 --> 00:43:04,169
it's possible to be great at everything

00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:05,609
at sea no one's like you know I want to

00:43:04,169 --> 00:43:08,910
be awesome at everything well good

00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:10,529
you know but specialization has its own

00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:13,049
rewards as well and I don't think you

00:43:10,529 --> 00:43:14,999
should shy away from specialization

00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:17,789
because it makes you feel like you're

00:43:14,999 --> 00:43:20,640
being shut out of other avenues it's not

00:43:17,789 --> 00:43:22,529
you know like as this kind of technology

00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:26,059
proliferates the the need for

00:43:22,529 --> 00:43:28,410
specialists only grows not not decreases

00:43:26,059 --> 00:43:31,739
yeah I kind of disagree with him on this

00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:34,170
it's fine what I wanted to say though

00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:36,299
not not entirely but in terms of

00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:37,799
specialization i think that the my

00:43:36,299 --> 00:43:41,670
approach for this type of thing is you

00:43:37,799 --> 00:43:43,140
know if you can truly understand the

00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:44,999
fundamentals of what you're working with

00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:47,730
if you can truly understand the Dom in

00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:49,589
the browser and understand you know the

00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:51,269
core the core values of various

00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:53,700
different frameworks and knowing how to

00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:55,259
do you know the fundamental JavaScript

00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,579
and things along those lines you're

00:43:55,259 --> 00:43:58,019
going to be able to get you're going to

00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:58,920
be able to do anything you know you're

00:43:58,019 --> 00:44:01,920
going to be able to learn what you need

00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:04,680
to learn and then what you do is you

00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,749
take a project and and you look at what

00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:09,239
what you need to do for that project in

00:44:06,749 --> 00:44:10,920
what technology makes the most sense you

00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:13,170
know I don't think I don't like the idea

00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,339
in Hmong people probably i don't think

00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:16,049
that Drupal is the best thing for

00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:17,579
everything I just I don't I mean I think

00:44:16,049 --> 00:44:19,619
that I don't that in the same way I

00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:21,119
don't think that using some framework in

00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:22,319
the front end is the best for everything

00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,720
either i don't think there's one thing

00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:26,880
that's the best so it's like what is my

00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,559
project need what can I do with it and

00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,700
then and then and then learning that to

00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:31,859
make it happen because you've already

00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:36,470
got those fundamentals expert a lot

00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:36,470
about that so that's my thought

00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:45,770
thanks for your great presentation thank

00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:48,310
you I come from a small segment maybe

00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:50,570
I'm a Drupal educator don't scruple to

00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:53,360
graduate design students in a design

00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:56,810
school and so Drupal 8 scares me a lot

00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,950
sure has the curriculum and have to fill

00:44:56,810 --> 00:45:02,990
up their brain even more than it already

00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:04,610
does but specifically the thing I see

00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:06,860
because I teach mostly people who become

00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:09,830
femurs and the best and maybe they're

00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:12,650
really just CSS artists there's still

00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:18,380
PSD to HTML practice in my department

00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:24,680
effect what would make Drupal 8 really

00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:26,450
more accessible for my students at the

00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:31,040
templating level would be to have some

00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:33,470
modular pluggable templating engines for

00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,930
example like Aoki template I know has a

00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:39,710
lot of limitations but PHP has already

00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:41,510
taught in my school twig is not so I

00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:44,900
have a whole new challenge in 15 weeks

00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:47,740
to teach Drupal 8 now is there a

00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:49,820
JavaScript server-side templating engine

00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:52,610
that's another question I don't know the

00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:55,550
answer yeah yes there's many many of

00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:57,740
them yeah um handles bar handlebars

00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:59,450
mustache things like that there if you

00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:03,320
google curly brace templating engine

00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:05,060
you'll get like 100 pages of results but

00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:07,580
the gentleman behind you the Nordic man

00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:10,940
with a pet backwards hat may have an

00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:14,420
answer yeah I did a session yesterday

00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:16,820
it's a one hour watch about how to boot

00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:19,790
week works you see that and you're done

00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:22,070
I'm with you oh it's 45 hours of

00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:24,410
instruction per semester though I prefer

00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:28,790
I said I said I said one hour that's

00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:31,580
what yeah okay but the thing is we have

00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:34,070
simplified stuff in in ways that is

00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:35,630
absurd yeah I'm not arguing with twig is

00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:38,120
a choice I'm just observing my dilemma

00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:40,880
sure Joe pluggable the templating

00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:43,160
engines for Drupal 8 where

00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,560
I could have a variety of choices for

00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,540
the underlying knowledge of my students

00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:50,360
would be really brilliant the other

00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:53,630
thing I'd say is that a headless Drupal

00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:55,700
or Drupal without a theme is prevalent

00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:58,280
and it's a lot of development it's a

00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:00,620
thing yeah I heard you advocating for it

00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:02,990
I'll share a takeaway that I got from

00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:04,970
the very last session in this room which

00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:09,110
was a survey of a lot of site builders

00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:11,480
pain points the lack of preview again

00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:12,950
that's coming from my student level this

00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:16,190
is be a huge challenge for headless

00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:17,810
drupal so I told her then yeah that was

00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:20,030
my point about having you know some sort

00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:21,590
of intermediate era of some sort of

00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:25,280
templating system like twig to do that

00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:26,960
kind of stuff so yeah um what before

00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,490
everybody else starts trickling out I

00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,770
think we're supposed to tell you to rate

00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:32,930
our session I'll be like an uber driver

00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:36,710
and say I'll rate you how I vray me I so

00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:38,330
um to the man who was just up here I

00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:40,150
would say that you should lobby for

00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:42,620
another course for your department

00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:46,820
because twig is a very valuable

00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:50,900
templating system and it's used in a lot

00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:56,470
of different websites not just dribble

00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:56,470
so that might be a different option or

00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,620
yeah Wow but I think you could make a

00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:07,570
really because if they're if they're

00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:10,910
already teaching PHP right you know

00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:13,310
totally I also teach in the in a graphic

00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:15,380
design program I in Ottawa and we

00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:17,840
actually taught her students how to

00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:20,600
template with Jekyll and they're

00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,830
committing on github and because the

00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,630
school won't give us server space

00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:27,050
because also we're a design department

00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:28,640
oh but then I can see their commits and

00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:30,800
I can see when we're grading I can see

00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:33,110
like even if they push at 3am I can see

00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,000
all of their commitments that's kinda

00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:37,100
sprocket your designers are committing

00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,370
to get yeah that's not freaking awesome

00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:43,910
so um because there's an app so your max

00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:46,850
makes it easier yeah yeah cool um I

00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:48,440
think that wraps it up thank you

00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:51,310
everybody for coming this is way better

00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,310
than I

00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:36,849
no I think it will be something that's

00:49:35,109 --> 00:49:38,650
understand or any sort of framework

00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:40,900
that's the party and that's the thing

00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:43,720
that I think is scary for a lot of

00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:45,799
people and a piece that it's going to be

00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:54,619
it's going to be hard

00:49:45,799 --> 00:49:54,619
