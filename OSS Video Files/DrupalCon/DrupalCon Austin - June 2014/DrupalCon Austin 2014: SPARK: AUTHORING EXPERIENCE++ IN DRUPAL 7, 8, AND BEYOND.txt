Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: SPARK: AUTHORING EXPERIENCE++ IN DRUPAL 7, 8, AND BEYOND
Publication date: 2014-06-05
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: webchick
Spark is an initiative led by Acquia's Office of the CTO under Dries Buytaert, the Drupal project lead. We take a holistic look at Drupal's competition and design and implement features to help close the gaps.

One big gap that has consistently held Drupal adoption back is that of the out-of-the-box content authoring experience. Hand-typing HTML like it's 1994, previews that aren't actually previews, and interfaces that are unusable on a mobile device all present big challenges for those coming to Drupal. While all of these problems have numerous workarounds in contrib, Spark's goal is to improve the Drupal product itself to eliminate this friction innately, so site builders can spend less time smoothing out rough edges and more easily focus on what they came to Drupal to do: build their actual sites. :)

Spark is both a Drupal distribution and a set of discrete modules for both Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 (in many cases, Drupal 8 core) which can enhance the user experience for your site's content authors, including:

Mobile Friendly Navigation Toolbar
In-Place Editing
Responsive Preview
WYSIWYG editing
Improved Accessibility
Redesigned Administration Theme
...and more!

This talk will focus on demonstrating these new features and explain how site builders can take advantage of them, as well as talk about what the next areas of focus for the Spark team will be for Drupal 9 and beyond.

hey everybody hey everybody yeah that's

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,290
better alright so we are here today I

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,700
hope I'm in the right room to talk about

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,170
spark and the authoring experience

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,320
improvements that have happened in

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,840
Drupal 8 and how that affects Drupal 7 a

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,609
little bit about me my name is Angie or

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:26,010
web chick I go by on drupal.org I am not

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,869
worthy whistles but I do like duple a

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,510
lot and I'm a huge nerd and I have no

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,910
life so that blends really well together

00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:35,700
in my personal life so I work with trees

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,590
and the office of the CTO at aqua I'm a

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,020
cork emitter for the Drupal project so I

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,780
commit patches and help you know get to

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,820
pallate done faster and more better or I

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,469
may add rupal association board member

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,200
and then I came into the community five

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,989
I'm sorry in 2005 nine years ago some

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,480
old through the google Summer of Code

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,969
program and kind of got my feet wet in

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,890
open-source that way and became totally

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,719
immersed in it because I realized that

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,730
anybody can contribute to something cool

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,860
like this and people really want to help

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,510
you so you know if you haven't

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,770
contributed before definitely kind of

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,770
the sprints tomorrow it'll be a lot of

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,549
fun so what we're gonna talk about here

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,110
is I'm going to give a little bit of

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,640
background information on SPARC I'm

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,320
assuming for the room you probably have

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,119
some idea what SPARC is but just in case

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,100
you like hanging out in rooms called

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,869
ballroom G just to see what happens I'll

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,220
let you know what that's about

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:25,439
then we'll do a little bit of a demo

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,490
between Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 to compare

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,799
and contrast the authoring experience

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,810
then we'll talk on if you're stuck on

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,540
Drupal 7 which pretty much everybody is

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,950
how you survive on Drupal 7 until

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,540
Jubilate when it's out when all this

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,310
stuff will be baked in and then we'll

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,079
also talk about what's next and for this

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,850
part especially since we're not not a

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,990
tiny room but a fairly small room I'd

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,850
like to actually do some audience

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,920
participation here because we're

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,479
currently sort of in throes between

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,790
trying to get Drupal 8 out and the next

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,079
sort of wave of innovative stuff we want

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,000
to do so I'd actually like to hear from

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,590
people in the audience about things they

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,909
feel are Drupal's biggest pain points

00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,100
that we should be looking at or other

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,259
solutions that are out there that we

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,630
should keep an eye on so talk a little

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,360
bit about that kind of stuff too so

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,590
spark is this project that was kicked

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,690
off in 2012 by Drees byte arts and what

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,800
he wanted to do was see a focused

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,750
attention given to Drew

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,760
author experience because we work a lot

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,410
on the developer experience and work a

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,690
lot on site builder tools and things

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,370
like this but really we don't do a lot

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,320
for the people who are sort of I call

00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,420
the victims of Drupal you know like

00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,100
those people who are stuck using Drupal

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,840
every day when when someone like myself

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,220
goes and creates a website for them and

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,020
it's really important that their

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,490
experience is awesome because you know

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,430
they're the ones who in a lot of cases

00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,290
we're really seeing this trend where it

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,730
used to be IT called the shots and

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,620
they're like I like Drupal so we're

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,330
using Drupal but more and more and more

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,590
companies are bringing in the people who

00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,570
actually have to use the system every

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,490
day to help form the decisions around

00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,140
that and so if the thing isn't easier to

00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,060
use it actually becomes a Drupal

00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,850
adoption issue and so we were trying to

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,770
address that so the goal was to build

00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,940
really kick-ass features for the current

00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:04,320
version of Drupal meaning Drupal 7 in

00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,640
contribu

00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,040
so that we could also at the same time

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,300
be building that stuff into Drupal 8 so

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,490
it form the next version of the platform

00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,730
is that a question back there are you

00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:18,180
just stretching I agree it's a good

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,470
stretch okay great so I'll talk a little

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,770
bit about our approach and how we went

00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,090
about that so we started by looking at a

00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,380
bunch of our different competitors and

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,630
we were really clear we wanted to look

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,370
at not only just like the usual suspects

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,830
like WordPress and Joomla that are open

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:35,790
source or competitors but also the

00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:37,140
proprietary competitors like cq5 SDL

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,760
trittye and some of these ones that a

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,500
lot of people at Drupal con may not have

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,090
even heard of but these are ones that

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,100
are multi million gazillion dollar

00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,600
things that actually have less

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,820
capabilities in Drupal but nevertheless

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,100
people use because they don't know any

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,450
better especially large businesses so we

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,760
looked at all those we kind of graph

00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,980
them out and what we found is that hands

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,320
down Drupal is the most flexibly

00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,970
technical solution that there is and I

00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,080
think that's that probably resonates

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,760
with a lot of people in the room like

00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,890
the reason we use duple is because it

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,230
can do anything if we want to build a

00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:09,180
blog for our little club site we can do

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,430
it in Drupal if we want to build a you

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,280
know headless restful api Wacka Wacka

00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,989
thing for MSNBC that you know goes out

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,760
to 60 different mobile apps and a web

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,950
front-end that isn't made in anything

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,140
but no js' you know we can do that in

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:24,210
drupal and it's great because you know

00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,260
it really allows you know someone can

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,210
start with a not very sophisticated

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,600
knowledge of web development go all the

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,190
way down

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,540
to the biggest projects on the internet

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,150
with this one tool that they have to

00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,040
learn however what we found is on the

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,230
authoring experience side everybody who

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,850
is kicking our butt and we see this

00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,960
happen a lot even just in the open

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,800
source world where people will

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,780
oftentimes

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,340
look at Drupal and WordPress side by

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,210
side and go oh my god this thing is

00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,590
terrible

00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,360
I'm totally gonna use WordPress because

00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,100
it's way easier and I can just do stuff

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,140
with it and they're happy with WordPress

00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,120
until they hit a wall where they try to

00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,320
do like that one level up of project

00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,790
from what they have been doing and

00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,650
suddenly they just find something that

00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,780
WordPress can't do or can't do easily

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,250
and then they begrudgingly come back to

00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,720
Drupal and then once they do they're

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,510
like oh this thing is totally awesome

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,760
and it's like how do we stop that one or

00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,440
three or five or whatever year gap it is

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,540
between people first looking at Drupa

00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,820
link sort of dismissing it as something

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,440
only for geeks or for simple things and

00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,290
you know really showing them the power

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,450
you know that has so what we did is we

00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,890
sort of looked at all of the different

00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,600
facets of authoring experience and sort

00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,310
of mapped that across different things

00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,080
and we looked at all of contraband we

00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,600
looked at you know both what Drupal core

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,370
had in the box and we chose to focus in

00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,800
a few different key areas that really

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:37,380
weren't getting a lot of focused

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,240
attention so you know we well I'll talk

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,890
more about what those are later but you

00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,770
know it things like in-place editing

00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:45,420
mobile authoring where we saw you know

00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,240
people like say Palantir was really

00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:50,070
owning the workflow space we saw you

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,600
know like a lot of like Dickson was

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,250
doing a great work on content staging

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,230
stuff we saw that there were areas that

00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,760
we didn't have boxes to tick even with

00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:00,180
controls and we sort of chose to focus

00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,580
there so our approach was we was started

00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,190
with design and we we tried to you know

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,750
first kevin o'leary our designer he

00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,730
would sort of mock-up these things in

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,410
fireworks or in envision or something

00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,930
like that and sort of run them past the

00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,610
internal team and we were all engineers

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,200
we tell them all the reasons why none of

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,670
that stuff would work and this was you

00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,810
know like not gonna work with contraband

00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,730
all these kinds of things and we'd sort

00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,110
of do a you know and then round of

00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,450
initial feedback and then what he would

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,700
do is create clickable prototypes and

00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,470
either in vision or sometimes in HTML or

00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,390
in javascript or css so instead of like

00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,980
looking at an idea of how something

00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,990
would work could actually like interact

00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,220
with it and then find ways that people

00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,730
were confused and stuff and we do

00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:40,950
hallway testing so you know at aqueous

00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,390
we have a lot of both in technique

00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,920
very highly technical and also really

00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,210
non-technical users so it's a great

00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,820
place to just be able to grab random

00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,410
people and see what they think and then

00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,490
we would refine those designs and share

00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,990
the results with the community so the

00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,880
community could also see what we came up

00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:58,620
with and then come up with their own

00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:00,300
thing it's cool dance all right and then

00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,490
we would iterate iterate iterate iterate

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,980
a lot to try and refine those designs

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,720
further so for example the the mobile

00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,130
navigation bar that we worked on that

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,900
actually started from the community from

00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,760
a gentleman named Louis Neyman who kind

00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,530
of came up with this idea of like you

00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,020
know putting some it's just static HTML

00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:17,850
stuff together see how a mobile-friendly

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,140
tool bar could even work and then we

00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,550
sort of built on that and you're like

00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,080
what if there are icons and stuff like

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,590
that and we built on it again to say

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,060
okay

00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,860
we have to somehow handle the nesting

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,690
stuff and people need to find things and

00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,430
so there's a lot of rapid iteration type

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,770
of thing that we did before we got to

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,420
the point of trying to code it for

00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:35,760
contraband for core and then we would

00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,230
argue a lot basically that was our last

00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,640
approach as we go into the issue queue

00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,930
and say we really think this is

00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,070
important here's all the work that we've

00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,830
done here's the people that we've worked

00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,790
with and then you know talk lots of the

00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,410
developers about implementation

00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:48,780
challenges with those things and then

00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:50,820
over time actually got a lot of these

00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,230
features into core so what did we

00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,820
actually tackle so far

00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,680
one is WYSIWYG so when you download

00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:58,200
Drupal 8 it actually has a WYSIWYG

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,330
editor pre-configured out-of-the-box its

00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,310
CK editor but it was all done in such a

00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,890
way that you could swap out ck edit for

00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:07,080
tiny MCE or any other you know sort of

00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:08,460
WYSIWYG editor thing or just turn it off

00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,170
if you don't want a WYSIWYG editor at

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,850
all that's totally fine because some of

00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:14,070
us like you know to remember how to

00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:16,920
write HTML like it's 1999 so that's

00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,870
totally valid in-place editing is the

00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,460
ability to actually click on something

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,110
that's on the page and edit it right in

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,600
place without having to navigate back to

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,250
the back end form this is mostly

00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,780
actually improvement for more small

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,040
sites than enterprise sites honestly

00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,590
because enterprise ties Thompson have

00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,660
like this huge workflow of all kinds of

00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,920
approvals or whatever but it does make

00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,420
it really simple and it solves the

00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,010
preview problem you can totally see

00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,960
what's actually happening on the page

00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,880
and see the effects of editing it

00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,830
immediately and then we worked on a

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,600
streamlined content authoring experience

00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,940
this again was an initiative that rose

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,190
from the community the boy and summers

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,860
Roy Shelton and

00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:55,199
Ryan Frederic from the drupal UX team

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,269
sort of envisioned this Photoshop

00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:58,740
mock-up of how we could redesign the

00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:00,959
content creation page to be much more

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,300
streamlined and and usable by people and

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,980
we actually injected funding into that

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,500
effort wonder crowd donated some

00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,790
engineering time as well to try and get

00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,220
that thing done and you'll see that in

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:14,220
Drupal 8 also and then in terms of

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,389
mobile friendliness a lot of work a lot

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,800
of prototyping around what does this

00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,209
look like on an iPhone what does it look

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,579
like in an iPad what does it look like

00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:22,259
in a you know like crazy you know

00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:24,029
refrigerator thing that we have on our

00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:26,399
coffee maker whatever like that kind of

00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:28,259
think really trying to you know not

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,970
focus on just the desktop experience but

00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:32,670
the whole way along and doing mobile

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,589
first in these kinds of things so so I'm

00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,120
talking a lot it's probably time to

00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:38,220
actually see the stuff in action and see

00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,259
if I'm full of crap or not so here we go

00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,899
a live demo what could possibly go wrong

00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:44,699
right any questions I guess before I

00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,740
dive into that about spark our

00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:50,089
methodology what things we looked at

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,089
what things were prioritized yeah

00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,610
yep so the question was so since spark

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,260
was very focused on Drupal 8 is there

00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,330
any work to backport some of that stuff

00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,959
to Drupal 7 and yes there is but don't

00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:19,410
spoil the rest of my presentation yeah

00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:21,690
sure uh yeah so the question was is it

00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:24,480
able to edit entities or only inline

00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:27,390
text it's able to edit any field on an

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,010
entity so and we'll see this in a second

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,050
here when I show you one knows but you

00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:33,089
can if I add a custom block it can also

00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,480
edit the title and description of the

00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:38,070
block if I add a I haven't tried on user

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,630
profiles but in theory it should also

00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,700
work on user profiles if you turn it on

00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,980
for that so any it's it's doing a sign

00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,440
in such a way that is is entity agnostic

00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,420
it works on a field level so it will

00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,260
employ a datang whatever field that you

00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,910
throw at it so there's no reason

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,490
wouldn't work on commerce products or

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:56,760
anything else yeah great question

00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:59,600
actually all right I don't see any other

00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,920
hand scible we'll jump into this and

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,750
pretend this whole top part is done in

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,579
black and white and like I'm crying a

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,620
lot because like it's so hard anyway

00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:09,540
I'll just show you so this is Drupal 7

00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,089
most people have probably seen Drupal 7

00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,100
and what it looks like so you know if

00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,839
I'm I'm gonna be a Content author and

00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,880
I'm gonna create a blog post about

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,990
Vancouver which is where I'm from and

00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,360
it's a town I'd love you all to visit

00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,490
sometime so I'm gonna add a content I'm

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,740
gonna add an article and then I enter a

00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,360
title this is like welcome to Vancouver

00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,060
and I might give it some tags

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,550
you know like mountains and oceans or

00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:37,110
whatever and then in my body field I

00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:39,270
want to say welcome to the wonderful

00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,310
city of Vancouver maybe I want to put

00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:44,490
some emphasis there what do I have to do

00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:49,339
to put emphasis there yeah I have to

00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:49,339
know how to type strong tags right

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,600
that's fun can't tell you how many

00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,220
content authors in big you know or even

00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,020
like nonprofits and stuff like that they

00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,329
totally know how to write HTML so this

00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:02,640
is great for them you know anyway so I

00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:06,029
was like here's a picture of our

00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,650
wonderful city you know I'll put a colon

00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:08,080
and I'll fill this out in a second and

00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:11,380
then please

00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,000
come visit us you know I'll put a smiley

00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:16,210
face cuz we're still friendly alright so

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,170
here I want to put an image in so what

00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna scroll down

00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,740
and luckily in Drupal 7 there is an

00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,630
image field in Drupal 6 this didn't even

00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,000
exist so this is you know rock and stuff

00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,670
so I browse and I go and I look in my

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,320
desktop for my image and I go ok there

00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,110
we go

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,850
upload that perfect that was wonderful

00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:37,030
but now what the problem is is I want

00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,380
that I want the image here not like over

00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,480
wherever it's gonna do so what I have to

00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,070
do is I have to right-click this I have

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,050
to copy the link address and then I need

00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,030
to go up here and I need to know how to

00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:48,640
write an image tag which is a little bit

00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:51,460
trickier you know I maybe want some alt

00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,680
text in here what am i doing fingers

00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,980
work with me here man thank you

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,300
there we go alright so I don't forget a

00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:02,410
title tag good point

00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:04,540
yep so title Vancouver and then you know

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,460
you're I'm all XHTML ready so I know to

00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,740
put a little closing slash here cuz I'm

00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,990
down with that alright so that is what

00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,460
in a straight out-of-the-box duple seven

00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:16,120
installation a Content author would have

00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:19,270
to do in order to put an image in a post

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,950
everyone agree with that huh you're

00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,240
wrong you know why cuz what watch this

00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,320
I'm gonna say oh one other thing I'm

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,210
gonna highlight is like this form

00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,770
Scrolls forever and it's got all this

00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,960
stuff and all of it looks really

00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:31,090
important you're like what's this what's

00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,260
provision if what's this bath and you're

00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,490
like clicking on all of them and

00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,930
wondering if you should do this or not

00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,550
and I'd say ok finally you're like ok

00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:40,890
I've dismissed I don't need to anything

00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:46,330
I'm gonna save this what's gonna happen

00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:48,820
what's that oh if only we had two images

00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:52,390
no what's gonna happen is I'm not even

00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:54,820
gonna get the image you know why yeah

00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:56,950
because I use filtered HTML and I

00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,810
actually have to use full HTML if I want

00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:02,640
to use an image in a post because that's

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:05,350
advanced right so I have to do this and

00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,820
now I get two images and one of them is

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,200
fine but the other one is inner stream

00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:12,840
Lee enormous size and it breaks my

00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,840
entire layout yay

00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,920
so Drupal 7 is awesome No so like and

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,329
you know people in here like kind of

00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,519
rolling their eyes like yeah yeah web

00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:24,649
trick nobody uses stock Drupal 7 they

00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:26,300
used like all kinds of cool modules like

00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:28,250
WYSIWYG module can work around this

00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:31,040
problem there's like cool modules that

00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:32,810
Nate hog is written you know like inline

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,639
image and stuff like that that totally

00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:37,639
working on there's fun I'm like yes and

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,870
you only know that if you are a Drupal

00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:40,430
person who's been in the community long

00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,350
enough to know what things to Google for

00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:44,480
to find that information out for normal

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,040
people who just download Drupal versus

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,560
WordPress and they try to do this thing

00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,449
in both systems this is exactly the

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,209
experience they end up having and this

00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:54,410
looks really bad for Drupal so let's

00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:58,940
talk about how this has changed in

00:14:54,410 --> 00:15:00,410
Drupal 8 so and Drupal 8 I go to my it's

00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,709
the same thing and I go to my home page

00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,850
I click add contents this is funny it's

00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:06,230
actually doing a thing because the

00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:09,470
screen is so narrow but we'll talk about

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:17,089
it later so the article hmm oh did you

00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:18,649
notice something overlay is gone if I

00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:20,389
want to go back to my site I just click

00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:23,779
go back to my site button and hey I'm

00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:25,550
back at my site all right wow that's a

00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:27,380
reason to use Drupal 8 right now no I'm

00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:30,079
just kidding okay so I go to article and

00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,180
I type you know welcome to Vancouver I

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,240
don't matter what I said something

00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:37,790
something awesome something and oh look

00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,300
at this I want to make this bold what do

00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,480
I do

00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:44,990
I click the bold button wow it's just

00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,779
like fantastic okay and then I'm saying

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,550
a cool picture

00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:51,560
welcome et cetera okay I don't remember

00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,389
what I said the other thing upon

00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,389
uploaded image I just do it right here

00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:59,269
image go find it it's whoops it's that

00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:01,069
one great I entered my alt text right

00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:02,480
here I don't know if it does title as

00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:03,529
well as alls I should look into that a

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,720
little bit but we're gonna call this

00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:08,569
Vancouver why are alt texts important by

00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,699
the way anybody you know for

00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:12,649
accessibility exactly so if if you can't

00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:14,600
see the image and it's not just because

00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:15,860
you literally can't see it cuz you're

00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,720
blind but it could also because your

00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,149
cell phone is freaking slow and it

00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,100
hasn't downloaded all this stuff then it

00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:23,540
will automatically put the text in there

00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,200
for you save some idea of what's what's

00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:29,029
happened

00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:31,579
sorry and SEO very good point yes SEO

00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,930
because Google doesn't know how to see

00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:34,550
your images either although apparently

00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,079
it does now parse JavaScript which is

00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,459
really interesting

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,820
alright so we're gonna go ahead and save

00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:43,490
that and it's big but it'll fix itself

00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,110
don't worry that's cool oceans mountains

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:48,940
something I don't wear what I said and

00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,940
then I'm going to save and publish it

00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:56,149
boom there's my image there's my stuff

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,680
and something that's kind of cool is

00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:59,060
this image is pretty big right yeah I

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,769
won't do that yet we'll get there later

00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,060
don't worry about the image size for now

00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,500
but the point being I don't have to

00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,150
scroll side-to-side it didn't make it

00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,980
that big it actually shrunk it down to

00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,750
their appropriate width so that was one

00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,339
step right was filling out the form and

00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,750
it was doing the things um the other

00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:14,660
thing that I called to attention there

00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,309
is that all the stuff I had to fill out

00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,689
like all the things that I is a Content

00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:19,459
author need to worry about those were on

00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:21,290
the left side and I went ahead and I did

00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:22,669
all that stuff and I didn't need to

00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,929
worry about this other stuff this other

00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:25,790
stuff was on the side so I can look at

00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:27,829
it if I need to and maybe I want to add

00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:30,200
a special path other than node1 to this

00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:31,760
page but it's not right in my face like

00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,740
begging me to click on it so this is

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,809
that whole content page redesign thing

00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,510
that we've done interpolates so sounds

00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:41,299
pretty cool right yeah all right so what

00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:44,270
if we want to edit this thing now so I

00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:45,799
spotted a typo where I meant to put two

00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,179
exclamation points instead of one

00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,130
because that is not nearly enough

00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:50,690
exclamation points right so what I have

00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,940
to do is I have to click this edit

00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,740
button and then I'm taken back to this

00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,390
thing that looks absolutely nothing like

00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,400
what the front end of my site looked

00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:00,530
like right this has no relation

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,720
whatsoever to what I was just looking at

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:04,730
but I'm like you know betting on okay

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,559
it's probably okay let's go ahead and

00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:10,309
you know add my second exclamation point

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,870
here but I'm kind of nervous about it so

00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:13,370
that you know it is actually what I want

00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:15,140
to do is probably put a width on this

00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,970
image so it's not so bad and why I'll

00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,240
maybe do with equals 600 or something

00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,250
like that

00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,169
so now I'm like okay well now that I've

00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,760
done that that width thing I want to see

00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:27,919
what that looks like right so you click

00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:29,990
preview and then what happens you see

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,980
your the note of the content you just

00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:35,900
created twice in case you missed it the

00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,910
first time there it is again in your

00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,200
admin theme which looks nothing

00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:41,090
like the front end of your site so

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,290
basically you really literally have no

00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,910
idea what your thing is going to look

00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,680
like until you save it and it's live and

00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,850
people can see it it's a little bit of

00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,530
an exaggeration because you can

00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,000
unpublish it by default but you

00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,680
definitely don't get anything like a

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,200
real preview experience and it turns out

00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,910
600 wasn't short enough I actually need

00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,440
to make it more like 400 so I'm going to

00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,120
repeat this process three or four times

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,880
until things look the way I want it's

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,130
very frustrating so in Drupal 8 if I

00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,300
want to do the same flow where I want to

00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,500
I'm not going to touch the image width

00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,320
because that's a different thing but

00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,820
let's say I want to you know put up I

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,280
actually want to fix my typo here

00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,600
because Samia Heaney is not a word that

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,280
I'm aware of maybe in a different

00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,620
language so I can click into quick edit

00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,980
and I can just say oh yes of course

00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:23,810
you're gonna do that anyway so I can say

00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,280
Vancouver and I can say you know here

00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,960
I'm gonna use something-something dang

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,270
it

00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,800
okay there we go it's still an alpha

00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:33,050
we're working on it and getting an

00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,600
honest thing there we go and here's my

00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:37,190
cool picture and and I can even into

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,810
your question was does it only work with

00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:40,640
text because so far I've shown inline

00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:42,590
editing a title in my edit body it's

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,940
like yeah yeah that's text what about

00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,590
something like taxonomy which is

00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:47,750
actually not text it's actually a

00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,580
reference to something else if I click

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:52,760
on this what happens is it automatically

00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:54,110
swaps out the back end form on the front

00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,310
end so I can actually edit it right

00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,710
there so this is what you'll see for

00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:59,330
things like dates user name fields

00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,640
taxonomy fields and stuff like that

00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:04,730
basis if you can't reconcile it to like

00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,320
a HTML rich text element it will

00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,580
actually just pull in whatever you'd see

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,690
on the back end but the difference is

00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,010
you get it right on the front end and

00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,430
can see the effect it has immediately

00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:14,840
under site so when I done I click Save

00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:16,550
and then that's edited it's done I

00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,440
didn't have to go to any back-end form

00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,030
if I made a mistake I could just quick

00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,810
at it again and go back in there again

00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:27,880
it's very very simple and easy to use so

00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:27,880
you know that's cool yeah all right

00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:34,120
one other thing I wanted to call out

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,650
just to give a Drupal stuff I'm giving

00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,150
Julis having a really hard time I want

00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,350
to like I don't it's just for the

00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:40,360
purpose of this session but it's like

00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:42,039
Drupal 7 is actually awesome and there's

00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,690
many many distributions and things like

00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:45,250
that that will offset all of the things

00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,299
that I'm showing you here but what I'm

00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,100
trying to emphasize though is from a

00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:50,440
Drupal adoption standpoint this is a

00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,120
problem because if you're not an insider

00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,820
you don't know a lot of these things so

00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,960
the other problem with Drupal 7 and

00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,549
you're already kind of seeing this here

00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,710
see how this toolbar is starting to get

00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:01,600
kind of janky you know like it's popping

00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,919
up a Hello admin on top of the other

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,720
thing and it's actually going to get

00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:06,940
even worse as I shrink down let you know

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,740
okay if I'm looking at this on a very

00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,240
skinny cellphone or something like that

00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,830
this is what its gonna and I actually

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,929
happen to have a very skinny cell phone

00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:15,490
on the other desktop and so this is what

00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:17,710
it looks like in an iPhone and you like

00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:20,200
half the screen is taken up by this

00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,700
toolbar that you know so you're getting

00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,020
even seeing your website you're just

00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,850
seeing this toolbar and how to click

00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:27,490
around it and stuff like that that is

00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:30,010
not a workable solution for anyone using

00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:32,730
mobile stuff so in Drupal 8 we've done

00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:36,220
this thing called responsive design and

00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,870
how responsive design works is and

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,250
unfortunately the screen width is not

00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,049
wide enough to make it go fully

00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,270
horizontal but picture it if you will

00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:45,460
then on a really wide screen you'd see

00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:47,530
tabs across the top for home about us

00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,630
things like that and then as the screen

00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:51,460
gets narrower those tabs would start to

00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,840
go on top of each other and sort of

00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,340
reflow the page and so that's what

00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,320
you're seeing here we're like the the

00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,200
tools block ends up beneath the content

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,100
rather than all squishing back and forth

00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,559
and then the other thing that you'll

00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,240
notice is as this gets even smaller

00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:06,429
you'll start to see like the the

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,130
description on the navigation blocks

00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:11,830
went away all right like goes like this

00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:13,960
and then as I click my manage toolbar it

00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:16,510
will actually flip a ian tation

00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,710
between vertical and horizontal really

00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,840
wish I had a different resolution to

00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:22,210
work out here but trust me on this it'll

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,770
go back and forth what goes up and it'll

00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:25,240
go back and forth when it's the screen

00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:28,059
is wide enough it will accommodate for a

00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,020
for a horizontal view which is really

00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:30,820
handy and then if you look at

00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,650
triple-eight in a cell phone this will

00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,930
be interesting

00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:41,200
hmm

00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:41,200
I'm gonna do this nope okay hmm

00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:46,160
yeah maybe I can change the scale

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,540
I have never I've never demoed this on

00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,000
like I don't know who know what this is

00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:52,730
like 420 by 120 resolution it's like

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,460
really really small the good thing is

00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:56,570
that Drupal II looks good in it though

00:22:54,460 --> 00:23:01,490
um so that's good

00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:04,010
Oh huh anyway oh good that's what I was

00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:08,360
looking for go back and then go here and

00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:10,150
then go there yeah great

00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:14,180
so in Drupal 8 it's gonna look fine

00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:17,570
here's my login thing guess well my

00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:20,390
password is it's very secure and then

00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:22,010
when I'm in here that bar just comes out

00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,900
I can pop in here go to you know

00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:26,240
structure into configuration any of

00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:28,130
those kinds of things really easily just

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,990
from my cell phone and even what you'll

00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:31,040
find is that I don't know how well it

00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,870
works right now because again we're

00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,670
still in alpha but even features like

00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,710
quick edit work so I can do a quick edit

00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:39,080
here and I can start

00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,550
additionally like typing stuff in the

00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,380
thing and it actually works on a cell

00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:43,970
phone as well so everything that we've

00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,010
done to make in-place editing work

00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:49,400
everything else it works completely fine

00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:52,640
on a narrow device yeah WYSIWYG totally

00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,020
works let's go down to the WYSIWYG yep

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,660
so here's your bold button your

00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:59,150
italicized button so I can zoo you know

00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,250
uh it gets a little funny because like

00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:03,110
the iOS and sometimes Android have

00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:05,090
different actions for stuff but yeah the

00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,490
buttons completely work you get a little

00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:09,740
funny things when you try to do you know

00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,850
fancy stuff like select all and doing

00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,820
this really fast with your fingers

00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:15,920
sometimes you run into iOS thinking did

00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,810
you mean to call up Siri or whatever but

00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,850
you know like that kind of thing cuz I

00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:22,250
always mean to call up Siri when I do

00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:24,080
stuff but anyway yeah so so yeah we

00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,280
anyway the bottom line being that we put

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,040
a bunch of time into making sure that

00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,540
this works well not just on you know a

00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,530
desktop computer but on everything else

00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,120
and the other thing I want to show you

00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:34,640
is in Drupal 7 it's really funny cuz

00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,380
like that's what Drupal 7 looks like by

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,520
default if you want to see the content

00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,380
you have to do this like swimming

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,120
exercise you're like what is that you

00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,190
know kind of stuff so anyway it's just

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,350
it's really quite a mess

00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,140
so yeah so now that I've scared you all

00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,190
the way from using Drupal

00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:53,240
let's talk a little bit about Drupal

00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:56,000
site yeah yeah right

00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,310
Drupal 8 I don't know it'll be released

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,170
is the the answer for Winn is Drupal 8

00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,670
released is when it's ready and so when

00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:04,280
it's ready means when there are no

00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:07,640
critical bugs and right now we have 97

00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:09,380
of them but we have had three hundred

00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,330
and twenty or something in Drupal seven

00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:13,130
at one point so we're we're not as far

00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,500
away but it really depends on the

00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:17,060
velocity and we're in a kind of a state

00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,070
right now we've been relying on the same

00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:22,460
like group of say 30 people to drive the

00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:24,440
release home for two and a half years

00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,760
and they need some help because they're

00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,440
starting to get burnt out and things

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,680
like that so the more people who ingest

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,120
energy and you know funding and beers or

00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,650
whatever it's needed to kind of give

00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,900
these guys a boost I think the better

00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:37,880
off we're all gonna be but you know it

00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,560
could be anywhere from we could still

00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,300
make the end of the year possibly if we

00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,280
get a huge injection like I think juries

00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,260
mention is keynote like if you get three

00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,940
times better at closing criticals and we

00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,840
currently are we could make it by the

00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,270
end of the year but we're probably

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,680
looking at 2015 at this point so it'll

00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,390
be a while so that's why you're like

00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,280
yeah that's all cute and stuff but what

00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,810
about the sites I'm billing today which

00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,670
for the foreseeable future are going to

00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:00,380
be on Drupal seven well I have good news

00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:02,030
for you because there is actually Drupal

00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,040
7 back ports of every single thing that

00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:05,270
I showed you here pretty much so I'll

00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,650
put these slides up because I know that

00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:08,300
type is probably kind of small about

00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:10,700
read them out loud so the WYSIWYG

00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,260
feature is ckeditor modules so just use

00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,080
ckeditor module you have the WYSIWYG

00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:16,760
feature for in place editing we back

00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,560
ported the stuff in Drupal 8 to a module

00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,480
called quick edit used to be called

00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,430
edits but we changed it to quick edit

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,270
because people like renaming things I

00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:27,980
don't know the responsive toolbar is

00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,960
back porting a project called mobile

00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,820
friendly navigation toolbar but all I

00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,250
would remember is navbar because that's

00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,870
the name of the project URL for a

00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,520
responsive front end theme there is a

00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:39,800
responsive bardic project but most

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,840
people don't build their websites with

00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,040
Bartek on the front end so what I would

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,230
do if I were in your situation is

00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,910
download something like omega' or Zen or

00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:48,970
adaptive or there's tons of them and

00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:52,130
they all handle that responsive

00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:54,020
grid-based like Yaka Yaka stuff for you

00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:56,870
so you just basically throw CSS on top

00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:58,480
of it like my website is responsive ish

00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,990
and I don't know anything about

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,400
responsive mark

00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,290
up the only thing I did was download

00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,910
Omega and make the background read and

00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:07,820
put my picture in the corner so you know

00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,620
like it's pretty cool if you want a

00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,429
responsive admin theme our team has

00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,200
worked on something called

00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:14,179
ember which you'll see in all like the

00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,280
aqueous demos and and our product demos

00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:18,800
and things like that responsive images

00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,280
is a module called picture that's not at

00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,000
all

00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:24,380
unclear responsive tables is a module

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,140
called responsive tables that's a lot

00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:28,309
more clear what responsive tables is I

00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,370
guess I didn't show that hold on a

00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:33,559
second because it's actually really cool

00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:36,679
how responsive tables works is in Drupal

00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:38,390
8 all of these things are views like the

00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:40,190
the people page the content page and

00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,720
stuff like that what it will start doing

00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,850
as the screen gets smaller is it'll

00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,679
actually start dropping columns out I'm

00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:47,240
already at the salons thing but when it

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,580
starts you'll see things like when was

00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,840
it last posted who's the author these

00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:53,360
kinds of things and you can actually

00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,740
rate columns on a scale of like low and

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,929
priority medium priority or high

00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:58,730
priority and then as the screen shrinks

00:27:56,929 --> 00:28:00,290
down any low priority columns will start

00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:01,670
dropping out and then the medium

00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:03,650
priority ones you could actually make

00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:06,080
the admin tables responsible so they

00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:07,220
work on a small device as well so that's

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,679
really neat and you can do that in

00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:11,120
Drupal 7 too and then that's simplified

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,250
overlay I talked about just that little

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,290
back to admin or I'm sorry back to site

00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:17,420
link Dave Reid wrote a module called a

00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:19,309
skate admin that does that so so really

00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:21,110
everything that I showed you here it's

00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:22,490
awesome that Drupal 8 ships with it and

00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,990
it's all integrated on the box and it's

00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,760
definitely going to help drupal's

00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,660
adoption especially when it's compared

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,510
and contrasted with some of our

00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:31,340
competitors but for people in this room

00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,600
or like kind of Drupal insiders they

00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,590
know how to search for modules they know

00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,510
how to grab things to put in their

00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:37,640
project they can totally use this and

00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:40,220
then I we have a ma we have a

00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,720
distribution called spark like based on

00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,520
the name of the project that actually

00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,830
pulls all this stuff together but it's

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,330
really not well maintained so if

00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,920
somebody wants to like join the team

00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:50,630
just to keep the thing updated with like

00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,309
core security updates and stuff like

00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:54,260
that I'd love to talk to you because we

00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:56,630
we've been very focused on Drupal 8 and

00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:58,250
not really enjoyable 7 but but if you

00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:59,929
want something that kind of shows you

00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:02,000
how to tie all these things together

00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:03,890
into one single distribution you can

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,800
build off of spark as a good project to

00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:09,610
share code so what's next so what's next

00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:12,410
for spark what I'm calling spark 2.0 is

00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:13,220
first before we even start spark 2.0 we

00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,710
need to get Drupal 8

00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,690
a lot closer to done and so what we've

00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:19,909
done is is the the implementation team

00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:22,220
for spark which considered about Jessie

00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:24,020
Beach whim leaders and Gabbar hoist she

00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,120
who've been doing the engineering work

00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,860
on all these front-end improvements they

00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:30,559
sense Prague have been focused almost

00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:32,330
entirely on resolving beta-blockers

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,710
resolving critical issues for Drupal 8

00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:35,419
to try and help get the release out the

00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:37,280
door and doing a lot of work like

00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:39,440
unblocking other contributors trying to

00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,270
bring you know new folks on board you

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,039
know trying to lis you know cat heard

00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:44,600
things like let's write change notices

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,700
for all the stuff so we can get the beta

00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,110
out things like that and for this

00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,520
foreseeable future that looks like

00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:52,400
that's going to continue to be the focus

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,110
of the team for now but then once we get

00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,669
beta out we can probably start taking a

00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:57,230
look at kind of what's going on in the

00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:59,150
world today because the last ideation

00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:01,070
process we did was about two years ago

00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:03,080
and you know the web moves quickly so

00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:04,520
we're really interested in that then

00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,679
we're gonna try and pill you know pick

00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,510
out the biggest pain points kind of

00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:12,320
build out prototypes start solving these

00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:14,929
things in Drupal 8 contribute selling

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,820
them in core and then I just put a

00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:18,679
spoiler alert there that in like from

00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,539
talking to people I have a feeling that

00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:22,159
media and layout are both going to rank

00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:23,630
on the subject of things that people

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,299
have a hard time with in Drupal and

00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:28,130
could stand to be a lot better but I'm

00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:29,390
also interested in other ideas and then

00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:32,090
finally what we want to do is propose

00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:34,130
these improvements for you know in Jesus

00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:35,480
spoke about semantic versioning these

00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:39,230
kinds of things are stuff that could go

00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,460
in a Drupal 8.1 X release or in 8.2 X I

00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:43,669
wouldn't have to wait all the way until

00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:45,710
duple 9 for most of this stuff so what

00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:47,720
we're gonna try and do is build these

00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,919
out and contribute some people using it

00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,450
feedbacking on it and then when they

00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:52,340
look solid then propose them for

00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,750
inclusion in core so that again the

00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,659
evaluators are Drupal get all of this

00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:57,919
stuff bill out for them in the box and

00:30:55,659 --> 00:31:00,799
then it's ported between versions and

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,030
stuff so these are some trends that

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,640
we're currently watching in terms of

00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:06,380
things outside of Drupal there's a lot

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,720
of stuff that's been heading towards

00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,070
like really minimalist authoring so like

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,230
you know we're using pretty stock

00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:14,480
ckeditor kind of stuff which is still a

00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:16,070
huge improvement over Drupal 7 but a lot

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,780
of you know things are going to even

00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:19,850
simpler interfaces and removing

00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:21,860
complexity and things like that

00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:23,929
I don't think Drupal can make enough

00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,460
assumptions to really get as minimal of

00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:26,419
a default authoring experience is

00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,919
something like medium

00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:29,779
or something that's very focused around

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,460
a specific use case but I think what we

00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:33,440
could do better of is is providing tools

00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:35,029
so that site Drupal site builders could

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,350
build interfaces like that just by

00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:38,929
clicking around in the interface which

00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:41,269
would be really neat personalization is

00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:43,039
a big area that we're watching so we

00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:44,359
build this project called aqueous but

00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,249
there's a tons of them that are trying

00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:47,720
to do this you know kind of getting to

00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:49,700
what Drees called the contextual web

00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,269
which is you know knowing who you're

00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,159
talking to

00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:53,989
knowing where they're coming from trying

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,659
to make the site built it with them in

00:31:53,989 --> 00:31:59,119
mind so if I search you know flights

00:31:56,659 --> 00:32:01,580
from you know Vancouver to Austin and I

00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:03,769
click into Expedia comm it's showing me

00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:05,720
results for that and not like have you

00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:08,149
thought about renting a car and you know

00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,580
Bogota it's like no I'm trying to get to

00:32:08,149 --> 00:32:12,080
Austin you know this kind of thing and

00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,580
then this whole thing around contextual

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,409
site building which is sort of like a

00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,879
simple way to do is like in place

00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:18,409
everything so it's not just in place

00:32:16,879 --> 00:32:20,059
editing of thing it's like I want to

00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:22,190
block right here where I'm looking and

00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:24,080
the ability to actually like pull up a

00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,999
drawer drag the thing into that region

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,289
and then close it so you don't have to

00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:28,879
keep bouncing back and forth between

00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:31,609
this administration panel that sort of

00:32:28,879 --> 00:32:33,200
abstract all the time exploring

00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:34,609
different ideas around that seeing how

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,409
much of that is actually feasible with

00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:37,879
Drupal and how much isn't those are sort

00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:40,190
of the trends that we're watching but

00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:41,450
what I actually wanted to do since we're

00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,309
kind of a small group is sort of get

00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:45,049
some ideas from the audience here

00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:46,429
because it's actually a really good time

00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:48,710
to get those ideas because we haven't

00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:49,879
started doing any of this yet it's all

00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:52,009
kind of on the back burner while we're

00:32:49,879 --> 00:32:54,580
getting Drupal eight outs so I like to

00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:56,899
spend how much time do we have here I

00:32:54,580 --> 00:33:01,460
have so skinny of a screen I don't have

00:32:56,899 --> 00:33:03,739
a clock 1:35 I think we have like 30

00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,869
minutes or so so let's maybe spend like

00:33:03,739 --> 00:33:08,119
five minutes just people shouting out

00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:10,039
this will be fun right very

00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:12,799
participatory what are the biggest

00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:14,720
points in in Drupal for content authors

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:20,210
that you've seen in what you've built

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:24,139
out previews I love it can I show it

00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:25,580
show of hands for previews oh man I'm

00:33:24,139 --> 00:33:26,690
gonna bold previews that was a lot of

00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:30,139
people okay

00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:34,369
other things menu items yeah so

00:33:30,139 --> 00:33:36,320
specifically like the nope specifically

00:33:34,369 --> 00:33:37,879
the ability to like build out a menu or

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,320
do you mean like the ability to once

00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:39,929
you've created a piece of content get it

00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,350
into them and

00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:49,379
where you want it both everything about

00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:51,119
menu items yeah I I agree it's really

00:33:49,379 --> 00:33:53,820
hard all right show of hands for menu

00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:54,960
items a little less all right I mean I'm

00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,330
keeping it on there but I'm not gonna

00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,860
bold it just yet so because I also run

00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:00,090
into that but I wonder if like things

00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,919
like that we could actually squeeze in

00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:05,749
before Drupal 8 even releases that would

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:08,339
be pretty cool all right other ideas

00:34:05,749 --> 00:34:16,710
editorial workflow I heard a couple

00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:22,770
other ones revisions links file

00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:24,059
attachments within the WYSIWYG I should

00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:26,550
show you some cool thing we actually

00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:30,530
have the ability to drag and drop files

00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:30,530
into the the here I'll show you

00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:35,940
I didn't get a chance to show that y'all

00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:37,290
are helping me refine my Drupal 8 demo

00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,059
this is very helpful but like if I

00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:42,119
wanted to put like a PDF file or

00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:43,589
something in here or this translation

00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:47,639
text I can actually just drag and drop

00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:49,109
it right well okay if I had text enabled

00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,669
for that field I could actually drag and

00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:51,839
drop it into there which is actually

00:34:50,669 --> 00:34:53,220
pretty cool but it's not very

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,839
discoverable so I think there is

00:34:53,220 --> 00:35:00,569
definitely more work we could do around

00:34:54,839 --> 00:35:10,400
that drag it from there into the okay

00:35:00,569 --> 00:35:14,430
got it so so desktop to WYSIWYG okay

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:17,630
well was it bulk uploads yeah that's

00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:17,630
definitely a huge problem

00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:25,610
yes how many times do I need to upload

00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:30,280
the Drupal icon to my blog I may have

00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:30,280
used it a few times right other things

00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:46,780
[Music]

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:51,819
mm-hmm okay yes it does for content

00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:53,680
authors all right I have another slide

00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:56,140
for site builders so hold those things

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,910
for you know like but yeah fair enough

00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:08,190
they want control over the design of

00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:08,190
what they're okay got it

00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:23,280
so the opposite of what he said making

00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:25,289
it more so not a blue or blue these are

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:30,380
the blues you have and you deal with it

00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:30,380
now okay yeah okay

00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:35,040
[Music]

00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:47,650
can you explain easier to write a theme

00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,650
for an editor

00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:08,850
so like easier to manage or like better

00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:22,760
selection of admin themes is that what

00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:22,760
you mean or yep I got it okay

00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:35,490
so like that what was Jason's project

00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:42,650
styler Skinner yeah

00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:42,650
Mike Skinner yeah

00:37:54,349 --> 00:37:58,069
might be helpful to know what they do

00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:00,579
think those are so we could call them

00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:03,919
that but yes that's a good point

00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:05,150
yep sorry I'm doing it really sorry for

00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:07,069
the recording I'm doing a really bad job

00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,689
of reading back what people said but I'm

00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:10,569
typing them for everyone to see so I'll

00:38:08,689 --> 00:38:12,439
float my slides and you can see alright

00:38:10,569 --> 00:38:14,989
sorry I cut someone off

00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:22,009
there's no hands it's just shout it out

00:38:14,989 --> 00:38:24,319
Oh copy paste from word and ie is done a

00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:28,130
ckeditor totally does that so that's yes

00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:30,979
but I'll have you tried it and Drupal 8

00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:31,579
though ok it should be better but yes

00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:35,989
I'll write it down

00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:40,869
paste I'm running out of things that's

00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:40,869
so sad here what can I do here we go

00:38:42,939 --> 00:38:48,199
yeah I could use triple 8 yeah I could

00:38:45,979 --> 00:38:49,669
make an entity for every single one of

00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:53,380
these entries we could put a 5 star

00:38:49,669 --> 00:38:53,380
rating on each one of them and you know

00:38:54,759 --> 00:38:58,909
the ability collaborative collaborative

00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:01,939
editing you know I don't know what pate

00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:04,279
was but that's now coming into this so

00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:10,489
they really do like Google Docs editing

00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:12,049
on in yeah it maybe it's better

00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:13,849
integration with Google Docs so you

00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:19,579
could just yeah that's the other side of

00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:21,469
that right yeah we have links somewhere

00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:22,880
up here so when you say links what

00:39:21,469 --> 00:39:26,809
you're talking about is when I want to

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,969
make a link to another article or like

00:39:26,809 --> 00:39:32,289
something internal to my website that's

00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:32,289
hard is that what I mean

00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,380
yep

00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:56,790
it's not a sub bullet that's a simple

00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:59,930
thing between continent you okay this is

00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:59,930
all good okay one more

00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:27,160
[Music]

00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:38,080
yeah I heard some groans in the room so

00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:39,250
yeah all right this is a good list so

00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:42,690
here's how this works

00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:44,890
everyone in the room gets two votes and

00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:46,840
I'm gonna go through each one and

00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:49,630
everyone's they raise their hand for the

00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,860
twice please please yourselves two times

00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,440
you get to raise your hand for

00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:55,300
everything that's on this list all right

00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,920
here we go and I'm gonna try and do some

00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,090
kind of horrible prioritization and it's

00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,040
totally not gonna work but it's fine

00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:01,990
we'll do this like in a better venue but

00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,120
you know it's just we're all here let's

00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:07,990
try it all right previews

00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:12,730
I think previews is staying on the list

00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:13,510
all right menu items sorry menu items

00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:15,970
all right

00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:17,880
editorial workflow stuff which I Wyatt

00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:20,230
try interpret it as things like draft

00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,020
that was a reasonable amount of people

00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:24,400
here what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna like

00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:26,680
I'm gonna put these in relative priority

00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,570
here okay so editorial workflow is more

00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:33,850
painful than menu items but menu items

00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:36,130
are still painful revisions no links

00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:37,840
within a page to other pages things like

00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:39,160
that all right it's a reasonable amount

00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,620
I'm gonna put that in the editorial

00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,450
workflow book it a way to see

00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:46,180
relationships between contents and the

00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:49,180
views that they're in the blocks sorry

00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:51,250
man that one's getting iced all right

00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:52,950
file attachments desktop - WYSIWYG

00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:56,830
trying to make your files work nicely

00:41:52,950 --> 00:42:00,990
all right all right staying on there but

00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:02,920
it's down with these things bulk uploads

00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:05,110
decent amounts I'm gonna say that's a

00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,240
middle tier one

00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:09,280
so here's we're gonna do bold those I'm

00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:11,260
gonna italicize those and I'm gonna

00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,670
leave the other ones normal we have such

00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:20,200
a great system here this is gonna work

00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:22,150
oh great right finding existing files

00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,380
dealing with existing files and linking

00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:26,020
to it did I already talked about that

00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:28,510
I think it's redundant I think that's

00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:31,390
very similar to links let's put links

00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:34,380
and files file links

00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:36,789
together and then we'll do that yeah

00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,930
let's move pastes from word to its own

00:42:36,789 --> 00:42:39,940
thing no because that's a separate thing

00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:43,420
paste from word how important is that to

00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:45,880
people not nearly as important as that

00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:47,619
you guys are very loud but not very in

00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:51,480
number it's just like the core

00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:53,680
developers it's like yeah okay um

00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,559
abstraction between editing and

00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,970
presentation layer being a huge problem

00:42:55,559 --> 00:43:01,329
so I would raise my hand for that but

00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:03,670
unfortunately we don't rank editing CSS

00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:07,750
the ability for content authors to make

00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:09,940
a blue or blue on their site couple

00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:11,950
people but nope how about the ability to

00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:14,859
for content authors to easily provide

00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:18,010
apply premade styles to the content that

00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:20,680
they're doing a couple people all right

00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:22,779
staying on the list but it's alright

00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,760
consistent content between pages locking

00:43:22,779 --> 00:43:26,890
down fonts and headers and things like

00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,750
that but just actually kind of the same

00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:32,079
thing so they're gonna put both of those

00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:34,480
together and make it consistent styling

00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:39,279
which includes colors and stuff and I

00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:41,250
put it in the middle bucket don't you

00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:43,630
love my scientific approach here anyway

00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:48,190
different body layouts three columns two

00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:50,079
columns stuff like that that are did you

00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:51,400
vote any other time all right so you're

00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,049
using both of your votes

00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,319
all right that's cool we can we can do

00:43:53,049 --> 00:44:01,859
that that's probably up here closer to

00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:01,859
the top up here whoops okay

00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:06,609
terminology region block it's set our

00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:09,009
node things like that exposing that to

00:44:06,609 --> 00:44:11,380
content authors I think that's actually

00:44:09,009 --> 00:44:13,299
a huge problem but apparently not big

00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:15,519
enough for us to work on so no I

00:44:13,299 --> 00:44:17,529
actually think we can fix that um that's

00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:24,759
let's talk about that more after this

00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:27,160
and then I think it's like there's a

00:44:24,759 --> 00:44:28,539
whole manner of things what I found when

00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,279
I did usability testing which I

00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:32,049
encourage everybody to try because it's

00:44:30,279 --> 00:44:33,549
so enlightening when you sit in a room

00:44:32,049 --> 00:44:35,710
and watch someone use Drupal for the

00:44:33,549 --> 00:44:38,049
first time and and we did this actually

00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:39,759
Google did did a hangout version of your

00:44:38,049 --> 00:44:43,319
usability testing on Drupal and there

00:44:39,759 --> 00:44:43,319
was an IRC channel we're all like Oh

00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:48,289
Oh God you know like kind of thing you

00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,089
say it's totally like that right so what

00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:52,190
I find is like if you show someone a

00:44:50,089 --> 00:44:54,500
mock-up it's like make this and it's

00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:56,630
like a website mock-up in Drupal they

00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,980
think okay so there's sidebar content

00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:59,569
there's content in the header and

00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:01,010
there's content lists that in Drupal

00:44:59,569 --> 00:45:02,930
we're like well that's a view and that's

00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:05,210
a block and that's a menu and that and

00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:06,980
like people don't think like that like

00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:08,180
so there's too many words to learn and

00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:10,099
then those words that we do have to

00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:14,680
learn are exposed to people who don't

00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:14,680
necessarily need to know them so alright

00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:20,809
it's not just that I want to be a little

00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,160
bit mindful of time I don't want to

00:45:20,809 --> 00:45:25,250
start a huge debate because we have to

00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,589
finish in 30 minutes so but yes that's I

00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:38,720
think it's it but it was like kind of

00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:40,609
what you're getting out there yes fair

00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:48,250
enough yeah so it's that everything is

00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:48,250
all over the place yep

00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:59,990
[Music]

00:45:55,850 --> 00:46:01,610
so well this wasn't a let's do this this

00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:04,250
it was kind of a bunch of stuff around

00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:06,410
content model transparent having to go

00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:09,520
everywhere to Everett edit everything

00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:09,520
[Music]

00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,300
with it

00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:16,970
rephrase that way does anyone else want

00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:19,070
to change their vote yay nope okay

00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:20,600
not really so it's still kind of a low

00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:22,730
priority thing how about collaborative

00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:26,480
editing trying to make it work like

00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:29,090
Google Docs a couple people but not

00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,920
really alright so what I'm getting from

00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:32,120
this conversation and we're all having

00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:34,520
many other conversations so it's fine

00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:36,200
previews are a huge problem the ability

00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:39,260
to select between different layouts as a

00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:42,260
huge problem and then a lot of things

00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:44,750
with getting files into your content and

00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:46,670
how hard that is bulk uploading things

00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:48,230
like when you replace a file what does

00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,820
that do to other links how do you select

00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:51,440
existing files you already have so you

00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,910
have to keep uploading things how do you

00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,250
find stuff you've already uploaded and

00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:57,440
things like that okay cool that's great

00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:59,090
I might skip the site builder one

00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,650
because we talked a lot about content

00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:03,200
authors and I think a lot of that kind

00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:04,850
of overlaps unless do we want to spend I

00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,900
really have to watch what time I think

00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:10,160
we are actually literally done it too so

00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:11,750
how do we do this first

00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,580
let's jump to the third slide which is

00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:14,780
what are other projects to watch out for

00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,430
what are things that you've seen that

00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:17,870
you've used internally the people have

00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:19,700
really liked that we should watch they

00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:21,860
have really cool things that we should

00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:23,630
be evaluating Drupal against and when

00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:28,070
we're doing spark 2.0 trying to pick the

00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:29,660
best ideas from I think general but

00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:35,440
focused mainly on like content authors

00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:38,440
and site builders toast ghosts like that

00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,440
okay

00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:43,670
yep I hear that a lot too

00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:49,820
yeah Squarespace has nice editing

00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,820
capabilities for sure

00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:01,260
okay

00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:14,250
what is it I'm sorry okay anybody in

00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:19,050
here ever have experience with like cq5

00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:26,730
or some of the huge ones that sound like

00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:28,940
good Sitecore it's terrible people use

00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:28,940
it

00:48:40,329 --> 00:48:53,020
okay all right what is it

00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:11,710
cool yeah actually that's a yeah all

00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,710
right

00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:21,940
what was it called I'm sorry impress

00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,940
pages

00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:37,800
cool craft craf t you never know it's

00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:38,130
web 2.0 so could be like X R I don't

00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:52,680
know

00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:57,900
schwa anyway live fire yeah things like

00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:58,950
that though well schwa I don't even

00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,840
think I know how to write a schwa

00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:05,130
anymore I don't

00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:06,630
and then yeah cool all right that's

00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:08,010
great I knew about a couple of those but

00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:09,630
a couple is I really didn't so thank you

00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:12,180
for that all right

00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:15,560
we have eight minutes let's start

00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,560
showing out site builder stuff

00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:30,760
yep there's all these people like I have

00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:38,320
the same problems as you we should go

00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:45,760
drink yeah all right others say that

00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:49,870
yeah I'm sorry I might have that now

00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:52,720
actually in Drupal 8 a new capability of

00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:54,490
blocks is you can create custom block

00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,860
types like you can cause some content

00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:59,260
types so you can make an ad block a

00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:01,150
silly block whatever you want and then

00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:03,130
those blocks are actually managed in the

00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:04,630
configuration management system so you

00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:07,060
can edit them and because they're

00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:08,380
entities with fields on them in theory

00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:10,680
you should be able to in place edit them

00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:10,680
as well

00:51:20,489 --> 00:51:25,239
yeah I yeah those are the ability to

00:51:23,469 --> 00:51:26,769
like kind of control and do synonym

00:51:25,239 --> 00:51:33,569
matching and things like that so your

00:51:26,769 --> 00:51:43,539
your taxonomy stay nice what's that

00:51:33,569 --> 00:51:45,189
workflow or tech side okay and wonder

00:51:43,539 --> 00:51:54,459
how that looks in a cell phone it's

00:51:45,189 --> 00:51:57,640
probably not good all right

00:51:54,459 --> 00:52:00,099
Marquis circle click I like this you're

00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:03,509
designing like 2055 user interfaces for

00:52:00,099 --> 00:52:12,479
today this is this is good right

00:52:03,509 --> 00:52:12,479
say it again yep

00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:21,600
hierarchical taxonomy x' I have a

00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,600
question that's none of my business but

00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:26,730
are you a librarian okay I just

00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,500
wondering cuz you're like I'm taxonomy

00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:34,280
man that is my thing so I'm just like

00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:34,280
doing all right with say that again

00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:46,010
contacts for blocks okay

00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:58,900
mmm so better visibility to what's

00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:58,900
showing up when

00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:02,749
[Music]

00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:09,760
[Music]

00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:09,760
so like a UI for that

00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,919
[Music]

00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:33,359
it's interesting the things you guys are

00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:36,090
throwing out here because like I didn't

00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:44,369
hear once like panels in core rules in

00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:46,290
core like know what I'm sorry no but

00:53:44,369 --> 00:53:47,849
it's it's good I like hearing like the

00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:49,530
problems that people are actually having

00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:51,570
and maybe they're not that maybe it's

00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:53,690
just fine for stuff like this one all

00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:53,690
right

00:53:54,650 --> 00:54:02,090
form okay and

00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:22,940
a be cool it's play sweet so I'm sorry

00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:25,160
you were trying to say content yeah

00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:26,270
content migration right migration and

00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:29,210
then I'm sorry there was one right

00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:32,599
before that might displace we all right

00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:34,930
we have four minutes so I'm gonna read

00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:36,950
these really fast mm-hmm

00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:38,329
reusable content that appears in

00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:41,990
different places making that whole

00:54:38,329 --> 00:54:44,420
process easier to do really okay

00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:47,869
not very money all right exportable

00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:48,980
blocks with editable content hey these

00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:49,790
are really granular I don't know that

00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:51,020
we're gonna get it much out of this

00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:53,000
exercise we'll try it though all right

00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:55,070
so no winners yet taxonomy term

00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,119
management sanity so the ability to all

00:54:55,070 --> 00:55:00,109
right Aereo that's a few people okay

00:54:58,119 --> 00:55:04,670
that goes the top list

00:55:00,109 --> 00:55:06,320
workflow for taxonomy is that part of

00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:10,190
the previous great then we don't need to

00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:11,690
ask that it I don't know what that's

00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:15,740
supposed to be but roles and permissions

00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:18,200
in men making that better marking click

00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:22,609
yeah all right fair number of people

00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:24,470
there these are it tells says better

00:55:22,609 --> 00:55:26,000
block visibilities more powerful block

00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:29,770
businesses hide things on different

00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,819
pages nope sorry I blocked visibilities

00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:33,410
hierarchical taxonomy is with views

00:55:31,819 --> 00:55:38,569
being I'm assuming being able to create

00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:42,920
views of them kind of thing yeah sorry

00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:45,200
extending context for blocks okay

00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:50,900
extending concepts for blocks and better

00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:52,160
visibility into which blocks are all

00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,290
right I'm gonna take these one at a time

00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:56,300
this one didn't make it so let's combine

00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:59,660
it with your other one better visibility

00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:01,700
into what's showing up when really that

00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:04,490
bites me all the time okay

00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:11,150
adding tokens in context UI path auto

00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:15,010
like sorry breadcrumbs oh there we go

00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:15,010
that lit up some folks

00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:26,150
bread crumbs block groups nope sorry

00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:27,830
these are all good ideas but we can only

00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:29,750
do like two of them so I want to like

00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:32,420
become okay point-and-click form design

00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:36,140
oh wow

00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:36,790
dang we found our new preview that's

00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:38,990
cool

00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:40,760
kevin o'leary will be so happy to hear

00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:42,860
that he has wanted to redesign the field

00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:44,090
UI for I don't know how how long he's

00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:46,280
wanting to do that and that's exactly

00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:50,960
what you're saying alright simple block

00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:52,460
migration excel style block bulk I meant

00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,270
bulk Mayra so you can like upload a

00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:57,740
spreadsheet and it'll suck it in nope

00:56:55,270 --> 00:57:01,430
alright keeping on list but it's not I

00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:05,150
mean an upgrade path that was a funny

00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:07,600
joke okay um content migration as

00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:10,070
opposed to configuration migration

00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:12,280
really fascinating alright

00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:14,870
middle-of-the-road but it doesn't rank

00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:17,950
alright you all are very surprising me I

00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:21,620
really appreciate this and display sweet

00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:24,560
few people alright awesome so what I've

00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:28,640
heard from this exercise is um if I can

00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:30,530
summarize in one minute

00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,670
in terms of content authors the biggest

00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:33,560
things that people see happening all the

00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:35,060
time is previews are terrible and it's

00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:36,260
really hard to tell what's gonna show up

00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:37,460
when on your site and how it's gonna

00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,870
look especially in different browsers

00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:40,880
especially in different things like that

00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:43,280
so that's a good area for us to focus on

00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:45,260
and also on the site builder side making

00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,000
it easier to do what Drupal can do well

00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:49,340
which is build this like structured

00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,990
content stuff and so making it easier to

00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:53,090
design entities and fields and things

00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:55,430
like that to actually build up the forms

00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:56,780
that content authors use and then in

00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:59,330
terms of things that we should watch out

00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:00,740
for in terms of new projects there's a

00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:02,210
lot of cool stuff happening on the

00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:04,010
editing side there's some cool stuff

00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:05,000
having content staging side we should

00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:06,320
take a look at these and other

00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,330
technologies to try and figure it out

00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,620
thank you very much everyone I really

00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:11,600
appreciate participation so what will

00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:13,040
happen from this then is sometime in a

00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,330
few months we'll be putting out a

00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,460
general call that we're actually firing

00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:17,720
this up for real but I really appreciate

00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:19,040
your input because I'll go ahead and

00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,300
pass that off so our designers and he

00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,240
can start marinating on that in the

00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:30,790
meantime so thank you really appreciate

00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:30,790
