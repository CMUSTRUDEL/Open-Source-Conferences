It no secret that Drupal has enjoyed a strong growth trend in higher education. That's the good news. The bad news is that it's still hard to do, especially when the horizon is no longer building a single website or application, but to scale up successfully to provide a platform for an entire university. This panel of experts will reveal what is working.

Moderator: Linnea Williams, Stanford University
Speakers:
Christina Dulude, Dartmouth College
Brie Pendleton, Harvard University
John Bickar, Stanford University
Nancy Flowers-Mangs, Yale University

This panel will address how each of these institutions evolved their campus strategies over time, from a technical, as well as community perspective. Topics will include: the risks and rewards of running Drupal as a platform for a university with in-house resources; employing principles of product design in maintaining and growing a Drupal platform; revealing the pros and cons of Distributions vs. small Features loosely joined; building community and internal teams, support and training.
