Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: SCALING DRUPAL FOR HIGHER-ED INSTITUTIONS
Publication date: 2014-06-05
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: linneawilliamsBrie PendletonJohn Bickarnflowers1228cdulude
It no secret that Drupal has enjoyed a strong growth trend in higher education. That's the good news. The bad news is that it's still hard to do, especially when the horizon is no longer building a single website or application, but to scale up successfully to provide a platform for an entire university. This panel of experts will reveal what is working.

Moderator: Linnea Williams, Stanford University
Speakers:
Christina Dulude, Dartmouth College
Brie Pendleton, Harvard University
John Bickar, Stanford University
Nancy Flowers-Mangs, Yale University

This panel will address how each of these institutions evolved their campus strategies over time, from a technical, as well as community perspective. Topics will include: the risks and rewards of running Drupal as a platform for a university with in-house resources; employing principles of product design in maintaining and growing a Drupal platform; revealing the pros and cons of Distributions vs. small Features loosely joined; building community and internal teams, support and training.

hi everybody welcome to scaling Drupal

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:09,000
for higher ed institutions before we

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:18,840
start where we have 10 seconds who all

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:20,580
here works in higher ed so my name is

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,109
lenio Williams I am the technical

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,760
project manager with Stanford Web

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,840
Services and I'm going to be moderating

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,519
this session today we have four awesome

00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,250
panelists we have Cristina delude from

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,739
Dartmouth College we have John baqar

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,930
from Stanford University we have Bri

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,750
Pendleton from Harvard University and

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:44,219
Nancy Flowers mangs from Yale University

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:47,000
and I just want to kind of couch this

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,110
with we realize that we all work at IVs

00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,579
that doesn't mean that you guys can't do

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,930
this stuff so um yeah and I really want

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,129
to say you know each of each of our

00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,960
groups is really working to our

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:00,930
strengths and that's what we want to to

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,520
emphasize here that we're all taking

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,489
different paths it's there's not one

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,619
right answer so this is kind of you guys

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,479
know this context but this is the

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,119
context we work in remember the good old

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,950
days when success was accomplished one

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,330
single website at a time

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,240
well now it's about scaling up

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,280
successfully to provide a platform

00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:25,110
distribution training and support for an

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,189
entire university take a deep breath so

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,850
some of the topics we're going to be

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:31,380
covering today include business models

00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:34,890
custom websites verses templates or

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,470
products training and support Campus

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,070
Drupal communities collaboration with

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,479
vendors and features with a capital F

00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:45,979
this is going to be less of a technical

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,030
talk it's more about how to think about

00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,920
collaborating with people across your

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,350
institution serve people the way you

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,729
need scale up your training things like

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,960
that and we're not going to be hitting

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:56,579
on these individually there's going to

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,110
be overlap we're going to have a whole

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,500
bunch of questions that will include

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,439
some of these topics so our basic

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,149
structure is and in the spirit of Austin

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,280
the quick draw which will be

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,569
introductions from each of our panelists

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,430
about what they're doing at their

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,140
institutions and kind of how that's

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,770
playing out a little bit then we'll get

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,000
into the

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,110
gritty which will be our panel

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,060
migration project which I'll talk about

00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,690
in a bit and we have a user Support

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,990
Specialists

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:49,110
so our clients our administrative units

00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:51,390
and academic departments we also manage

00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,670
sort of larger institutional resources

00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,580
such as the Dartmouth that edu home site

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,230
and we also manage things like the

00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:02,570
faculty directory which is a Drupal site

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:04,980
and what are the front face of our

00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,630
institutional offense calendar I'm sort

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:10,890
of bringing in more of these larger

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:13,200
scale projects also so we don't support

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:16,080
individual people's website so no

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,799
faculty portfolio sites no student sites

00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,209
no lab websites no course websites we

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,380
have a different tool for that that's

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,540
sort of more of a self-service tool we

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,650
encourage people to use we're also in

00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,530
the process of migrating 200

00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,810
websites from a legacy CMS over to

00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,970
Drupal we launched these first Drupal

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:38,080
sites pretty much right around a year

00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:40,539
ago and we are we now have 30 sites that

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:45,039
are either launched or in process so

00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:46,720
only 170 more to go um so yeah that's

00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:49,240
sort of Dartmouth Web Services in a

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:59,530
nutshell trying to go through some of

00:04:49,240 --> 00:05:05,860
your images that's what we're doing yeah

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:09,100
so that's our team and so this is the

00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:11,020
example of our home site which is the

00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,910
front facing dog that UD site and so

00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:16,060
there's actually more to that page but

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,410
only that much so if you go to you you

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,010
can see it in all its glory

00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:25,150
um this is a department website web site

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:27,280
and we have like a basic template for

00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,680
that where they academic department

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,680
sites all follow they have like the same

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:48,970
sort of overarching theme but they have

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:51,970
sort of different a profile on our

00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:54,070
faculty directory um and there's sort of

00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,659
more to that page too if you want to

00:05:54,070 --> 00:06:01,090
seeking of it start with the edu slash

00:05:55,659 --> 00:06:05,080
faculty - directory examples of the

00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:08,889
types of sites that we do great gun well

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,930
let's let's move on to Bree hi I'm brie

00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:12,580
Pendleton I work at Harvard University I

00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,130
manage training support and

00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:19,449
documentation at my group which is

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:22,180
Harvard web publishing at Harvard web

00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:23,919
publishing we use open scholar to build

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,599
our sites so open scholar is an open

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,080
source platform built as a Drupal

00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:30,820
distribution and it makes provisioning

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,530
at my lab enough yeah okay

00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:36,669
it makes provisioning sites very easy

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:39,130
for us we offer two levels of service

00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:39,969
for a website implementation we offer

00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,189
basic service

00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:44,289
so that's like project managed we take

00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:46,989
you through a schedule and you get the

00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:49,719
whole PM thing content strategy and then

00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:52,479
we also have self-service website

00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:54,149
implementation this this is dy I mean

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,610
you do it yourself it's free

00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:59,799
we also offer training and support both

00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:02,409
free and upgraded but all of the free

00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:05,279
are both of these groups get classroom

00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:07,569
trainings extensive documentation online

00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:11,939
there's a community forum where you can

00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:14,439
log questions report bugs kind of

00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:15,939
speculate about what might be great in

00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:17,769
the future and then we also have a

00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:23,139
campus community called what we call

00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:25,059
ABCD open scholar so this is a little

00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:27,159
bit about our timeline just to give you

00:07:25,059 --> 00:07:29,229
a sense about what has happened in the

00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:31,569
web space at Harvard University so you

00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:33,009
can see that Drupal or open scholar

00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:36,849
which was Drupal 6 at the time was

00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:38,739
created around the fall of 2009 and it

00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:40,360
was used being used almost solely at the

00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:45,009
department in which it was built and

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:47,649
then in 2011 it was determined that open

00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:51,009
scholar would be the supported software

00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:53,199
platform for web publishing at Harvard

00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:54,369
my group Harvard web publishing and at

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,550
that time was called Harvard web

00:07:54,369 --> 00:08:01,389
publishing initiative was created in

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:06,219
January 2012 we migrated our software to

00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:09,569
Drupal 7 in April 2012 we overhauled all

00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:14,309
of training and support model in June

00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:17,709
2013 we started our community-based

00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:20,769
monthly campus learning group January of

00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:23,649
this year and we've rolled out our

00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:25,659
funding model since then and so in the

00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:28,089
last probably like two weeks we've

00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:30,399
trained up our lower-level helpdesk to

00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:34,539
help us maintain some of the support

00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:36,309
that we need here at our campus so about

00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:39,610
Harvard web publishing who are we and

00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:42,639
why did we become a group so we are part

00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,079
Harvard University IT part Institute for

00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,449
quantitative Social Sciences which

00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:49,179

00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:50,740
development process and then H pack

00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:16,190
people 7 developers to support people

00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:19,760
and three interns our group started in

00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:22,550
January 2012 we have a combination of

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,980
core funding and cost recovery currently

00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:28,640
we have over 4,000 sites on our platform

00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:31,339
and we are migrating about a thousand

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:36,110
from our legacy CMS to open scholar in

00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:39,080
the next two years both using our basic

00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:41,330
and/or free kind of self service

00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,700
depending on the funding that the group

00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,710
has so this is just an example of a

00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,150
basic implementation up here it's the

00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:50,200
Faculty of Arts and Sciences human

00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:53,510
resources department just kind of quick

00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:56,120
and this is sort of a snapshot of our

00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,860
Harvard community so we've got a page on

00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,510
our site that kind of links you to all

00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:02,540
the things you need to know about to get

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:05,390
involved with having a open scholar

00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:08,270
Drupal site or just learning about it

00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:11,540
and then this is some of us at a

00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:14,000
Christmas party but it's not all of us

00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,730
if not at all and some people in terms

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,070
of gone and this is my most recent one

00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:23,450
thanks thanks Bri thanks lion hi

00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,640
everybody

00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,570
a couple of logistical things if you're

00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,360
standing in the back there are some

00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:31,490
chairs over here also we have posted the

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,580
slides I posted a link to them in the

00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,410
comment section of the node here so my

00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,150
name is John Dakar I'm a Drupal web

00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,950
developer and Stanford web services I've

00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:42,950
been at Stanford and doing Drupal for

00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:45,080
over seven years the history of Drupal

00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,580
at Stanford is a bit longer than at some

00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,050
of these other universities we've been

00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,650
doing it for a long time it started as a

00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:53,630
real grassroots effort as such we have a

00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,580
pretty robust Drupal community on campus

00:10:53,630 --> 00:11:00,230
we have over 300 users on our mailing

00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:03,160
list we have an annual Drupal camp great

00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:07,329
it's not as big or as bad as bad camp

00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:10,279
it's not quite as bad as that pun either

00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:12,529
but Stanford Web Services was formed in

00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:15,459
2011 as the first group on campus that

00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:20,810
offered centralized Drupal training

00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:23,870
development support and hosting Stanford

00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:25,459
Drupal at Stanford followed the path of

00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:28,120
a lot of technologies at Stanford in

00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:30,410
which innovation happens at the edge

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,079
Stanford is a very experimental culture

00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:35,300
we do a lot of things move fast fail

00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:36,769
fast what happens with these innovations

00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,110
that happen at the edge when the

00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:41,959
technology grows more robust and grows

00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,670
more mature it centralizes and Stanford

00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:46,790
offers more centralized support and

00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:49,040
that's what Stanford Web Services is so

00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,420
our mission is to provide the Stanford

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,370
community a full range of Drupal website

00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,170
planning design development and

00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:58,730
maintenance support at well below market

00:11:54,170 --> 00:12:00,769
rates this is our team our team consists

00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:06,649
of seven incredibly talented and

00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:08,480
hardworking individuals and myself we

00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:10,399
also have a cardboard cutout of an alien

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,060
named Howard he's a stand-in for our

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,010
standard user persona Howard drives a

00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:21,050
lot of our decision-making in terms of

00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:23,540
user interaction and user experience we

00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,709
provide we build custom web sites for

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,800
example this for the Department of

00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:30,019
English at Stanford we also maintain a

00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,850
free self-service software as-a-service

00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:34,820
Drupal hosting platform called Stanford

00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:36,410
sites this is an example of one of the

00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,029
sites how it looks out-of-the-box it's

00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,949
using the open-source open framework

00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:41,690
theme which we maintain at Stanford

00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:44,000
development maintained at Stanford we

00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,370
also do several Stanford branded

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,040
sub-themes based on open framework that

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,810
are available to anyone at the

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,149
University tested for mobile

00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:54,440
responsiveness accessibility etc these

00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:58,430
are services that we provide to the

00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:00,500
University finally this is a site that

00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,850
was built with the self-service software

00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,470
as a service Stanford sites platform

00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,060
this was not one developed last so this

00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,920
is an example of the community using the

00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,899
tools that we provide for free to the

00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,290
University with that brief overview I

00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:15,470
will hand it over to Nancy flowers banks

00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:18,199
hi everybody I'm Nancy Flowers mangs

00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:20,360
and I am the senior web community

00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:22,190
manager for Yale University and

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,740
basically what that means is that I'm

00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:27,709
responsible for training communication

00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:30,110
documentation in support of our Yale

00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:33,290
sites but and in our growing web

00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:35,269
environment Yale sites is our web

00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:38,149
publishing tool that is built with

00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:39,709
Drupal we do have other options out

00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:42,829
there we also have a WordPress service

00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:46,130
who is not and that group is not part of

00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:49,970
our group but we are big supporters of

00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:52,329
Drupal as far as it being the main web

00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:57,290
publishing tools for our business and

00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:59,449
operations groups faculty and courses

00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:02,060
type websites are usually in the the

00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:03,860
WordPress offering our Yale sites

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:07,339
instance we started working with that in

00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:09,560
2000 between 2009 and 2010 2010 we

00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:11,810
launched our first Yale sites where we

00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,630
focus mostly on technology and did a

00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:17,089
rock-solid provisioning system which was

00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:19,060
which is what Pantheon was built on so

00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:22,250
it's a kind of a Pantheon type system

00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,360
but we learned quickly that we should

00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:27,290
have paid a little bit more attention to

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,120
the user and so while it was better than

00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:32,209
just doing HTML which is what we had

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:36,589
before it still missed the mark a little

00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:38,120
bit so when d7 came we decided to put

00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:39,769
our resources toward making it better

00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,880
for the user we actually had about you

00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:43,040
know two or three years worth of

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,360
research and watching people struggle

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:49,250
with our d6 instance and so we created a

00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:54,410
pl sites in the d7 instance which has

00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:56,329
been quite a big success all of our all

00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:59,149
of our services are free we don't charge

00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:01,069
back I should say also in the process of

00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:03,410
that we were with IT s when we did our

00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:05,029
d6 instance then they moved us to the

00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,069
Office of Public Affairs in a

00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:10,459
non-technical environment and now we

00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:12,980
recently been moved back to IT s because

00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:15,019
when we and we built the Yale sites d7

00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,850
in the Office of Public Affairs but

00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:18,740
because we weren't an IT s we didn't

00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,380
have as many technical resources to kind

00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:23,480
of expand on our initial offering so

00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,970
we've kind of been moved around but

00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:29,839
still we have no cost for our services

00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:31,970
we provide trainings of support we have

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,519
an extensive how-to guide and we

00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,319
encourage users to ask questions and

00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:38,359
interact with our Yale sites forum to

00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:41,269
get the answers and find the answers

00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:44,419
that they need one of my biggest jobs is

00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:46,849
developing a community within Yale which

00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:48,829
has been the hardest thing for me mostly

00:15:46,849 --> 00:15:50,509
because people don't want to do anything

00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:51,889
they certainly don't want to come after

00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:54,470
work I'm sure anyone in an academic

00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:57,470
apartment environment can understand

00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,569
that and getting them for to a lunch

00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,659
meeting without food has kind of been a

00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:07,659
challenge so so we're working on the

00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:10,759
food part but anyway the the underlying

00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:12,619
that kind of the light version of our

00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:14,059
technology is that we it's built with

00:16:12,619 --> 00:16:15,919
features so in other words we have a

00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:18,079
news feature a video feature photo

00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,669
gallery feature so people don't have to

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,409
think about what they're doing other

00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:24,529
than what kind of content they want and

00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:27,019
they just add it we provide both

00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:28,909
template and custom theme options but

00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,309
you'll see in the next few pictures that

00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:33,470
I show you we encourage people to use

00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:36,109
our template because it follows Yale

00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:40,099
standards not just in the design but

00:16:36,109 --> 00:16:42,049
also just good web standards so we

00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:44,059
encourage them to use our template as

00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:48,289
their foundation even for their custom

00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:50,389
theme the templates are responsive they

00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:51,559
can be built either in-house on the

00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:55,369
custom themes can either be built

00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:56,809
in-house or with a vendor and we do have

00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:58,279
a list of Drupal partners that we

00:16:56,809 --> 00:17:03,349
recommend because they're familiar with

00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:05,480
our arielle sites platform now that the

00:17:03,349 --> 00:17:06,620
thing about our our instance which may

00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,169
be a little bit different from other

00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:11,360
people is that we have kept our instance

00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:12,709
to be very Drupal II in other words when

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,689
they go in they'll still know that their

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:16,939
Drupal but they don't come in with the

00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:20,089
blue and white they come in looking like

00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:21,919
if we go to the next slide yep they'll

00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:24,259
come in this won't look exactly I'm

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,949
sorry like it but it will look something

00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:26,449
like that

00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:28,100
so they're not they're going to look

00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:31,009
like it's a Yale sites now this is our

00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,480
Yale sites homepage and that's where

00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:35,240
everybody can find everything that they

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,240
need to know about Yale sites the next

00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,370
slide should be an example of our

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,750
our template and this is what most

00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,309
people use and it's interesting because

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,840
we thought that people wouldn't want to

00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:46,820
use a template they wouldn't want to be

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,230
restricted but when they come to

00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,210
training which we encourage them to come

00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,740
to I always kind of explained to them

00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:53,870
that this is kind of an open and airy

00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,610
template and with the right content

00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,279
which of course brings a blank stare

00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:59,929
with the right content you can actually

00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:03,110
build a really nice website with just

00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:05,840
these standards and the next slide is an

00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:08,600
example of a custom template which you

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,059
can custom theme actually which you can

00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:14,000
see follows a lot of our standards but

00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:18,549
has a very unique feel and so we've had

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,350
a lot of success working that way great

00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:22,610
so let's get into the nitty-gritty now

00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,820
that we kind of know a little bit about

00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:29,570
where you guys are coming from I want to

00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:31,370
start with the way we're thinking about

00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:34,159
our University and what we're offering

00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:36,289
so so starting with Christina in what

00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:38,960
ways are you tailoring your services to

00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:42,559
match the culture of your university or

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,539
college so Dartmouth is smaller than the

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,419
other institutions on this panel we have

00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:49,760
a little over 6,000 students about 4,500

00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:51,919
undergrads and thousand 500 graduate

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,830
students and so probably partially

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,899
because of that our IT infrastructure is

00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:59,630
a lot more centralized than that of many

00:18:56,899 --> 00:19:02,539
schools were also very we take it's a

00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:04,549
very a top-down approach for example our

00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:08,929
campus Drupal user community consists of

00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:10,490
the people on our team like one site

00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:13,399
they're sort of like a service that web

00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:17,149
services like Gulliver is unto you so

00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:19,220
our campus IT is also very high touch so

00:19:17,149 --> 00:19:22,179
how many of you work in the central web

00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:26,510
services department at your university

00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:28,370
ok and of you who use how many of you

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,840
when you deliver someone ask for a site

00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,909
and you build a site for them to just

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,710
give them an empty site and it's up to

00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:35,510
them to sort of build out their content

00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:40,340
types and their views and all that who

00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:42,110
does that set up well so I thought it'd

00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,850
be more of you do that so in any case um

00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,909
we do pretty much the exact opposite of

00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,909
that

00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,790
we said we we build the views and the

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:56,050
content types and we build all the

00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:58,540
templates for everyone and remember I

00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:01,270
mentioned earlier when grabbing to

00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:03,640
earlier how we have launched or are

00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:05,770
currently working on 30 sites within the

00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,250
past year I'm sure many of you are

00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:10,900
thinking really 30 that's it but this

00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:14,010
isn't a straightforward migration we're

00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:16,600
doing from the legacy CMS over to Drupal

00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:20,230
instead for each site we do a full

00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,540
Content inventory we work we rework the

00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:25,090
information architecture for the larger

00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:28,110
sites we do user personas and card sort

00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:30,910
exercises who knows what user persona is

00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:32,710
good card sort exercise who knows where

00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:35,050
that is good

00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:37,300
so we also work with our clients to

00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:40,090
select beautiful banner images and come

00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:44,260
up with a color scheme that reflects the

00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:46,870
colors used in the banner and then we

00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:50,110
have two people on our team who help

00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:52,840
copy and paste all the content into the

00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:54,550
site and so at this point the clients

00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,140
haven't seen the backend of Drupal at

00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,850
all yet or the admin interface like we

00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,110
kind of walk them out we work with them

00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,120
to develop their content and their

00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:03,700
imagery but we don't actually get them

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,580
in there editing until after after we

00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,510
launch the site so I'm sure many of you

00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,150
are thinking

00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:13,660
the obvious question of why not just use

00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:15,270
migrate module and call it a day and we

00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:18,070
actually did automate this process

00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:20,890
initially I wrote a script that crawled

00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:23,110
the directory structure of the HTML

00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:25,000
output from don't legacy CMS and we've

00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:27,700
made this big XML file let me fit it

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,500
into the site with feeds module because

00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,600
these feeds match over everything but

00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:34,600
then that's when we realized that the

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,010
content itself needed to be reworked and

00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,560
that's around the time that Sarah joined

00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:41,800
our team as content strategist and so we

00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,270
took that opportunity to examine all of

00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,710
the content and sort of shine a

00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,719
flashlight and all the dark corners and

00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,399
the

00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:49,469
because most of our sites had launched

00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:51,239
about seven years earlier and people

00:21:49,469 --> 00:21:54,539
also just kept throwing stuff up there

00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:57,209
and not really we're taking stuff down

00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:59,039
and they also aren't web writers

00:21:57,209 --> 00:22:01,259
particularly so we needed to kind of

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:08,159
overhaul the content this is some scary

00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:11,039
dark corner exactly yeah so yes after we

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,139
launched this site then our clients have

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,989
mandatory drupal training with our

00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:18,389
support specialist and he sits down with

00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:21,209
people one on one and shows them how to

00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:23,189
use Drupal and at that point the site

00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:25,229
has been theirs and they're responsible

00:22:23,189 --> 00:22:27,509
for content we do sort of keep an eye on

00:22:25,229 --> 00:22:29,239
the sites though sort of informally if

00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:32,669
someone seems to be having trouble

00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:34,919
choosing nice banner images for like

00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:36,329
their nice done they feature images for

00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:38,519
their homepage we'll send them a little

00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:40,289
email like hey you seem to be having

00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:42,359
some trouble choosing nice images would

00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:45,749
you like some help and they do actually

00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:46,889
seem to appreciate that so so it's

00:22:45,749 --> 00:22:49,889
totally locked down all they can really

00:22:46,889 --> 00:22:51,779
do in there is edit content and create

00:22:49,889 --> 00:22:53,249
new content they don't they can't create

00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:55,489
content page they can't move their

00:22:53,249 --> 00:22:58,469
blocks around they can't create views

00:22:55,489 --> 00:23:01,319
and so our top priority for our Drupal

00:22:58,469 --> 00:23:04,109
sites was to make it very very easy for

00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:06,839
the content editors to manage many of

00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:08,939
them it's not their full-time job to

00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:10,349
manage the website often their

00:23:08,939 --> 00:23:12,949
administrative assistants or

00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:15,239
occasionally their faculty members and

00:23:12,949 --> 00:23:18,359
managing the website is sort of another

00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:20,729
duty as assigned and not one that they

00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:23,639
particularly enjoy and so many of them

00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:25,829
log in to the website as infrequently as

00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:27,719
possible so we wanted to make it easy

00:23:25,829 --> 00:23:32,279
for them we also wanted to keep content

00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:35,059
fresh and so we are working on pulling

00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:37,379
in content and information from other

00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:39,899
institutional data repositories on

00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:41,629
campus for example our faculty directory

00:23:39,899 --> 00:23:43,619
which we showed a screenshot of earlier

00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:46,529
that's a system where each faculty

00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:47,939
member can log in and edit a profile but

00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:50,350
then the information from that profile

00:23:47,939 --> 00:23:52,960
gets fed out to the pro

00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:55,630
I'll page on there in the academic

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,630
departments that they're in and so in

00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:00,070
that sense it's it's always current if

00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,929
they update their publications listing

00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:03,700
it's automatically updated on their

00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:07,000
department site as well

00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:09,400
we're also pulling in events from our

00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,039
institutional events calendar and so if

00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,720
events are tagged as belonging to a

00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:16,750
particular department those events will

00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,140
automatically get fed into the events

00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:21,370
listings on those departments sites

00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:23,710
we're currently working on building out

00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,850
a new site and Drupal right now it's in

00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,590
WordPress but we're going to be moving

00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:29,260
it over to Drupal and once that's done

00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:31,390
the same thing will happen where news

00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,400
articles that are tagged as belonging to

00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:35,620
specific departments will be listed on

00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,330
those department pages so we're hoping

00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:40,210
that sort of a combination of making

00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:41,799
truevolt very easy to use and minimal

00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:46,150
work on keeping content fresh tools I've

00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:48,730
encouraged our content editors how many

00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:50,380
people have centralized data stores for

00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:52,330
faculty information and for events

00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:55,450
information like that how many of those

00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:57,640
are in Drupal yeah that's a pretty

00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:59,380
common it's a pretty common scenario and

00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,549
I think Christina's touched on it and

00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,770
we're dealing with the same thing

00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:04,659
getting faculty to enter their

00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:06,070
information and getting events in a

00:25:04,659 --> 00:25:08,340
centralized place and sharing events

00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:10,840
passing events from one site to another

00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,980
it's a it's a common challenge and I

00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,740
think it's something that all of us are

00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:16,750
facing so you're not alone in that yeah

00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:18,940
so Bree do you want to talk a little bit

00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,919
about kind of how you're tailoring to

00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,750
match your University and also the way

00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:26,380
you think about buy-in how you frame

00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:28,630
Drupal at Harvard because we use open

00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,440
scholar we don't actually talk about

00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,960
cool

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,240
we know that it's Drupal our end users

00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,250
aren't exposed to any Drupal talk

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,230
they've never heard of a node or a block

00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:40,510
and we do that on purpose because we

00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:42,880
feel like it's it's a lot of it's a big

00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:46,390
undertaking to not only teach them how

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:49,179
to use you know the front end or the CMS

00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:51,070
part of Drupal and just to manage their

00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:53,740
content and update things and keep

00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:56,340
things relevant and fresh but to bog

00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,690
them down with talking about Drupal and

00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,340
Drupal speak kind of it gets

00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:03,100
overwhelming so that's something that I

00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,910
think we do rather successfully you know

00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,650
we we call

00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:09,270
things post's you know we do talk about

00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:12,820
the layout we they have administrative

00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:14,560
area functionality available to them but

00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:17,380
we kind of keep it nice and light so

00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,840
they don't feel overwhelmed so our big

00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:22,330
sell for Drupal I'd say at Harvard

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:26,650
University is that we it is supported so

00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:30,400
if you move to open scholar rupal then

00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:32,140
you can get help from our group and like

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:36,820
I said in the opening slides you've been

00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:39,490
training up our first tier one helpdesk

00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:42,130
folks to be able to triage some of the

00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:45,280
lower hanging fruit for our group and so

00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:47,620
I feel like they the user group at

00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,630
Harvard feels like they always can get

00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:52,330
help so that's how we're doing that

00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:53,440
successfully creme so Nancy do want to

00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:56,260
talk a little bit about how you

00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:00,550
structure and address requests for new

00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:02,860
features to your service one of the ways

00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:05,740
that we do that is through our user

00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:07,210
forum and we encourage people we have

00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,550
people come through training our setup

00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:12,310
is a little bit different from what Bree

00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:14,320
just talked about in that we don't it's

00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:18,310
not a hundred percent Drupal but we do

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:20,650
have blocks and and use the regular menu

00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:22,740
system and so it looks a little bit like

00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:24,970
Drupal with it with the Yale Flair but

00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,890
but when something comes up and someone

00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:29,020
has a problem after they've attended

00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:30,580
training then we asked them to post

00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:34,450
their question to the forum and we're

00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:37,240
able to monitor the the most frequently

00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:39,130
requested features like what types of

00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,530
things people want a lot of times what

00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:43,180
will happen is someone will create a

00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:44,620
website a custom theme and they'll say

00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,030
like for instance the one that we showed

00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,430
you in the world and people saw that

00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:50,200
rotating feature and they wanted it and

00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:52,660
so we're in the process of building a

00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:56,620
feature with a capital F so people just

00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:58,150
have to enable it and add pictures and

00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:01,240
news stories that are connected with it

00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:04,540
so we're able to have people go directly

00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:07,030
to the forum and then we we just it's

00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:10,000
just a regular Drupal forum with

00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:13,210
comments and we dialogue through that it

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,650
does help to keep down the direct emails

00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,280
I always tell them if you email me

00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,100
directly

00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,350
your

00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,899
almost guaranteed it's gonna get lost in

00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:22,639
my inbox but if they do it through the

00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:25,369
forum there's a chance that more people

00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:27,590
will be able to address it and if it's

00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:29,450
something that I can't address I can

00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:30,889
forward it to our more technical team

00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:33,080
and then they can take care of it

00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:35,359
so are people allowed to add custom

00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:38,929
modules custom themes to their site at

00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:42,049
all and so we we do have a predefined

00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:44,299
set of modules that are part of our set

00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:46,090
up but if there is a good reason for

00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:50,479
someone to add a module we do allow that

00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:52,700
it's not locked down in that way and and

00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:54,289
any other theme that they want would

00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,389
want base theme when we work with our

00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:58,759
Drupal partners so a lot of times they

00:28:56,389 --> 00:29:00,109
want a different base theme we do talk

00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:02,320
to them about that because we want to

00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:05,179
make sure the reason that we prefer our

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,470
yellow sites templates is because they

00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:08,149
we know that they're following the

00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:09,559
standards that they're following the

00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:11,149
design standards that they're going to

00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:12,979
be responsive that people are going to

00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:18,529
be able to work with them once that

00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:20,119
vendor relationship has ended a pretty

00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:21,529
good point especially talking about how

00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:24,169
she's moved from itst university

00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:26,269
communications back to IITs one of the

00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:28,909
common challenges that all of us face is

00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:30,049
that we're not really a lot of us aren't

00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:31,549
really trying to solve a technical

00:29:30,049 --> 00:29:34,279
problem we're really trying to solve

00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:35,960
communications problems we want to get

00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:38,599
the best and the brightest at Stanford I

00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,129
mean the heck with these guys right and

00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:43,070
that's really ultimately we're

00:29:40,129 --> 00:29:45,440
fulfilling a communications problem and

00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:46,879
so having consistent branding having

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,869
consistent accessibility having

00:29:46,879 --> 00:29:52,009
consistent use of the logo and

00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:53,779
responsive really helps us fulfill that

00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:55,369
we like the technical things but it is a

00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:59,479
communications function as much as it is

00:29:55,369 --> 00:30:01,820
a technical one okay and breed you and

00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:04,340
talk about how you're structuring sure

00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:06,529
so we do something that I think's rather

00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:08,210
interesting we not only with our basic

00:30:06,529 --> 00:30:10,249
implementation you know our PMS are

00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:11,749
working hand in hand with different

00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:13,519
groups on campus to define what they

00:30:11,749 --> 00:30:16,609
need and if it's not something that we

00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:19,099
have pre-built in open scholar every

00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:21,379
single request if it's from the

00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:23,289
department of chemistry or student who

00:30:21,379 --> 00:30:26,269
just needs a site for his student group

00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:27,750
they post all of their requests on our

00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:30,929
community forums so

00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:33,929
it's built off of get satisfaction and

00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:36,870
so we're able to or anything that anyone

00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:38,730
wants always has to go first into what

00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:41,340
we call the community and so it's

00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:42,929
completely transparent people can but

00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,390
you can go in there and you can vote for

00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:47,100
a feature or you can the developers can

00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:49,860
ask questions of the person who

00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,659
submitted the you know initial posting

00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:53,970
and so you're really starting to see

00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:55,980
things flush out and what happens after

00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:58,220
that is it gets put in the bot backlog

00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:00,929
and so we have a six week development

00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:03,059
cycle and so all of the things in the

00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:04,380
backlog get discussed and week one which

00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:06,799
is planning and then they get

00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:09,960
prioritized from there and we kind of

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,520
scope it out to see if if whatever these

00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,620
requests are we'll make it into this

00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,870
release or maybe it gets pushed off

00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:18,030
because we've decided as a team it's not

00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,470
a feature that many people at the

00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:21,570
university would use because that's the

00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:25,110
goal it's not to build this one special

00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:26,669
snowflake module for with this one

00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:28,409
person who desperately needs it we're

00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:31,080
trying to build things that many people

00:31:28,409 --> 00:31:34,980
can use in many different ways so we can

00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:36,169
actually scale up successfully yeah John

00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,309
do you want to talk a little bit about

00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:39,780
because Bri when you're talking about

00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:41,340
that the impression I got was that you

00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,650
have a separate dev team for your

00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:47,610
product versus custom websites or

00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:50,640
implementations yes yes we will do we

00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:52,470
have done custom we are hoping to do

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,340
more custom in the future but pretty

00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:58,169
much we take the open scholar core and

00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:03,059
we will build off of that we won't just

00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:04,590
build John you want to talk a little bit

00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:06,539
about the structure of our team and how

00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:09,929
we've been sort of skirting that as a

00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:11,429
team sure so like I said Stanford Web

00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:12,780
Services has been around for about two

00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:15,150
and a half years and we started out

00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:17,820
building bespoke custom websites for

00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:21,710
clients and we found out rather quickly

00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:24,809
that that doesn't scale and at all and

00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:26,610
so we've moved we're starting to morph

00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:29,700
more into a product product development

00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:33,330
shop Cristina talked about and and Bree

00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:35,070
talked about the admin who doesn't care

00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,210
who managing a Drupal site is not part

00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:38,100
of their daily job and they don't really

00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:39,870
care and taking the Drupal out of it and

00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,510
I joked about Howard our cardboard

00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:43,770
but we really focus on Howard and we

00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:45,990
build these products

00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:48,180
Howard is our admin in an academic

00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:51,170
department and Howard doesn't want to

00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:53,460
build contexts Howard doesn't want to do

00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:54,840
contextual filters and views Howard

00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,270
doesn't want to know what a beam is and

00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:01,620
so we really let Howard drive a lot of

00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:04,110
our UX and our UI and similarly in

00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:05,580
working with departments and units on

00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:07,110
campus and building these bespoke

00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,640
websites there are a lot of things that

00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:11,190
are constant we talked about faculty

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,520
profiles publications news events

00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:16,140
courses these are pretty common then

00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:19,380
there's also the use case of a little

00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:21,780
bit smaller like a lab that just has

00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,820
they just got grant funding they need to

00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:26,160
launch a website tomorrow to fulfill

00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:28,460
part of their grant proposal they just

00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:31,260
need five pages talking about the

00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:33,660
project and a couple of pictures maybe

00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:35,550
of their pie so we have rolled out two

00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,080
products one called Stanford sites

00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:42,270
jumpstart to fulfill the use case for

00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:45,570
that small lab it's very clean very

00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:47,520
simple it's we positioned it as a Google

00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:51,050
Sites killer all static content comes

00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:53,370
with completely responsive templates a

00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:56,280
custom layout on the front page but then

00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:58,350
like five top-level menu items simple

00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,880
WYSIWYG easy out of the box forever

00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:02,040
maintained on our central service and

00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,840
then a product that's called Stanford

00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,340
sites jumpstart academic which is more

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,300
robust it has the dynamic faculty

00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:11,580
profiles publications news events and

00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,899
we've rolled that out now for two

00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,720
different departments on campus the

00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:18,090
public policy program and the Department

00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:20,639
of Sociology which you can see at public

00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:22,950
policy that's stanford.edu and sociology

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,149
dot stanford.edu and for the jumps an

00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:26,909
example of the jump start one you can

00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:28,409
look at provost at stanford.edu yeah and

00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:31,409
I'll say you know our team doesn't have

00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:33,300
a big training force behind it we have

00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:35,460
strong developers and so I think that's

00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,440
the direction we've tried to go is make

00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:40,200
something that that doesn't even need

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,330
training if you can do it because we

00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,580
just didn't have the bench to be doing

00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:49,409
lots of training and so speaking of

00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:51,039
training like that transition even talk

00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:53,419
about training at

00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:54,950
at Yale and how you guys are structuring

00:34:53,419 --> 00:34:56,210
that yeah and and so that it is

00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:58,339
interesting because when we were

00:34:56,210 --> 00:35:00,769
preparing for this talk and we're all

00:34:58,339 --> 00:35:02,599
kind of sharing our different stories we

00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:05,299
realized that a lot of the ways that our

00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:07,460
platforms had been developed was kind of

00:35:05,299 --> 00:35:08,989
based on who he had for staffing so

00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,210
people who had a lot of developers were

00:35:08,989 --> 00:35:13,910
able to develop a lot of more custom

00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:16,759
things and have it out of the box and we

00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:19,009
when we first when we when we did our d6

00:35:16,759 --> 00:35:21,140
implementation we were in AI TS we had

00:35:19,009 --> 00:35:22,999
some stronger IT people then when we

00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:25,099
went to OPEC there were four or five of

00:35:22,999 --> 00:35:26,900
us and so that was a pretty small team

00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:29,210
and each one of us had our own strengths

00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:32,569
we had one developer one person who was

00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:35,869
a CSS one person who was just kind of a

00:35:32,569 --> 00:35:39,319
site builder and then my specialty was

00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:40,789
training and communications and when we

00:35:39,319 --> 00:35:43,700
did our d6 and since we didn't think

00:35:40,789 --> 00:35:45,829
anyone would need training and that that

00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:47,410
quickly we found out that that was

00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:50,390
probably something that we would need

00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:53,900
and so we've always had a really strong

00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:56,719
training program it's not required but

00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,190
we try and evolve it and and kind of

00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:00,680
build the community so people want to

00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:02,150
come training is free and all of the

00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,160
training is hands-on so people are

00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:05,719
actually working on their sites while

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,210
they're in training and so it's a lot

00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:11,150
easier to justify a full day of training

00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:12,890
when someone leaves and at least three

00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:14,900
quarters of their site is built if not

00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:16,519
more it all depends on how big their

00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,680
site is so and again we're talking about

00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:20,029
the basics template basic templating

00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,119
sites we're not talking about custom

00:36:20,029 --> 00:36:26,079
themes but the training has been really

00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:29,329
really successful and it has allowed us

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:31,369
the fact that I'm able to do it as my

00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:34,609
primary job it's allowed us to have a

00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:36,109
more open platform and I actually do

00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:39,369
teach content types and views and I'm

00:36:36,109 --> 00:36:41,630
pretty amazed at how people pick that up

00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:44,989
people say oh you teach content types

00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:47,150
and views but it really because we have

00:36:44,989 --> 00:36:48,710
a dedicated person and I you know I'm

00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:50,630
not teaching them contextual filters

00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:52,339
out-of-the-box I'm teaching them how to

00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:54,019
create basic lists I'm teaching them the

00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:56,869
basic concepts of you know the

00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:59,779
underlying database and how you know how

00:36:56,869 --> 00:37:02,150
you create structured content but it's

00:36:59,779 --> 00:37:04,730
it's really been successful and helped

00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:06,710
us to helped people

00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:10,720
are people to do what they need to do to

00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:15,140
build their websites your head you sure

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:18,080
so what we did when we hwp Harvard web

00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:21,200
publishing moved open scholar from a

00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:23,240
department to our group we overhauled

00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,710
all of training so it was a one-hour

00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,200
training where they kind of talked about

00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:29,540
everything and it's now two and a half

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,480
hours so we offer department based or

00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:34,430
group based training so it's two and a

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,980
half hours we go through 15 activities

00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:39,140
and we talk about different concepts

00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,820
kind of Drupal concepts but also best

00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:43,280
practices so it's really great I do the

00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:46,100
I do the trainings myself and people

00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,080
really learn a lot and we also offer a

00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,850
training for people looking to build a

00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,710
scholarly website for an individual

00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:53,540
because obviously some of the activities

00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:55,430
would be different and the goals and

00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:58,040
methods and how you build the site would

00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:00,230
be different as well we have

00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:02,240
documentation also but we do encourage

00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:06,380
people to attend training it's not

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,990
mandatory but if you or to submit

00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:10,280
support request to be I might say hey I

00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:12,170
haven't seen you at training I might

00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,490
look you up you know and say you haven't

00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:15,500
been to training maybe if you came to

00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:19,160
training it would cut down on some of

00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:21,260
this unlike what Nancy does we build

00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,480
sandbox sites so they're like just

00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:25,100
totally test sites they build right

00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,200
their day off they have access to them

00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:29,570
up to two weeks so they can play around

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,580
but we don't have people working on live

00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:33,740
sites because there are too many

00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:35,510
questions about very specific individual

00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:38,150
like but I want to do this and it might

00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:39,860
derail the class you wanna talk about

00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,400
your support model so how people get

00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,380
helped

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,690
that's leading into your training yeah

00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:47,510
so that's a big deal to we have multiple

00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:49,250
ways so like I said we can we've trained

00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:51,860
the helpdesk so that's kind of our Tier

00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:54,650
one me and another co-worker and some

00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:56,150
coops we do tier 2 support and then we

00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:58,820
have tier 3 support which is our

00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:01,130
development team so we use a ticketing

00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:02,840
system like most universities do so if

00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:04,730
anyone has a question they email to IT

00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:09,710
Help at Harvard I edu and it gets routed

00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:12,560
to our group bypassing the help desk if

00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:15,620
needed and then additionally what we do

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,470
is we have our a/b c/d open scholar so

00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:20,710
it's our monthly topic

00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:22,869
we would I consider to be advanced

00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:24,880
training so one month we did everything

00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:27,880
on taxonomy we taught how to use

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,070
taxonomy we had like low level to very

00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:33,670
very high level examples and then also

00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:35,980
with that 15 minutes of every one of

00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:37,930
those meetings we open it up for people

00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:40,540
to bring their laptops and bring their

00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:42,520
real-time questions we have the

00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:48,970
community forum we have our

00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:53,380
documentation sites so I'm gonna jump

00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:55,510
ahead John since at Stanford we had this

00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,830
existing community we're not really

00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:59,260
working on building up a campus

00:39:56,830 --> 00:40:00,670
community um how do we how do we think

00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:06,340
about integrating with an existing

00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:08,560
community without causing confusion it

00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:10,510
can be a challenge one of the things

00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,390
that has happened as Stanford Web

00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:15,099
Services has started and grown is that

00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:18,369
we now kind of have a target on our

00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:19,330
backs everything any help ticket that

00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:21,820
comes in that has anything to do with

00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:28,570
web comes to us which we may or may not

00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:30,070
be scaled to to deal with the the ways

00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:32,380
that we integrate with the community is

00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:35,230
that we're very we follow the very open

00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:37,750
source mantra so we we open source

00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:41,410
almost all of our code we make sure that

00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:43,060
we participate a lot in things like the

00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:45,099
Drupal scamp the Drupal camp and the

00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:48,130
Drupal errs list and help people out

00:40:45,099 --> 00:40:50,320
on all the various platforms of Drupal

00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:51,849
that they can be using we have kind of a

00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,589
dual responsibility based on our dual

00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:55,030
funding model so we're a combination of

00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:57,130
core funding coming from the provost

00:40:55,030 --> 00:41:00,099
office and cost recovery so we do charge

00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:02,230
back to clients at below market rates so

00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:05,020
we have a responsibility to the general

00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:07,270
Stanford community web community not

00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:09,310
just Drupal community but we also have

00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:12,010
responsibility to our paying clients and

00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:14,740
balancing that can be a challenge and we

00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:17,200
honestly we go back and forth almost on

00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:19,270
a weekly basis and in terms of defining

00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,020
our priorities who should we be serving

00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:26,320
whether or not it's the larger powerful

00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:27,760
more better funded entities on campus or

00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,650
the little guys who don't have any

00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,730
funding and we really try to do our best

00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:33,010
without getting spread

00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:35,710
to thin but I will admit that it's an

00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:38,200
ongoing challenge yeah

00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:40,060
so Nancy from the other perspective what

00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,250
sort of what sort of things are you

00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:44,940
doing to build a campus community yeah

00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:48,160
so that as I said in my initial

00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:50,950
presentation that building the community

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,230
it's been the hardest most of the people

00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:56,290
who are building sites are admins who

00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:57,730
did not expect to be building websites

00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:59,980
some of them are more excited about it

00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:03,070
than others but some are just like this

00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:05,109
is not my job and so I have really

00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:07,060
worked to try and get people

00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:09,430
enthusiastic to encourage them to let

00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:11,160
them know that they can do it in

00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:13,060
training training has been a big

00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,430
community event even though it doesn't

00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:17,590
might not seem like it because when

00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:19,359
people come to training I really really

00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:21,160
try and let them know that you know they

00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:23,500
can't break this which is a big relief

00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,359
because you can before this basically

00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,980
people were building sites in HTML and

00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:30,400
they could just delete the folder and

00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:33,730
you know kill the site so that their

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:37,510
fear is is probably is reasonable with

00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:40,300
the past history but I let people know

00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:42,070
that they can't break it I let them do

00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,840
whatever they need to do to try and make

00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:45,730
the mistakes within class so it's a very

00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:49,300
open and encouraging environment and

00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:51,100
then we also have we do have yell sites

00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,770
Drupal group which is kind of slow to

00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:55,510
get going but the biggest success is

00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:58,480
that is having our yell sites Drupal

00:42:55,510 --> 00:43:01,540
camp which is a full day and we actually

00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,700
get people I don't do any presenting and

00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:06,310
we get people who are actually building

00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:08,080
sites to do their to do presentations on

00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:09,910
what they've done and that's been really

00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,680
really successful you can it's kind of

00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:13,270
like like when you leave Drupal con you

00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,710
leave with that glow and you see

00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:16,810
everybody leaving with the glow and it

00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:21,400
really it's really a nice a nice feeling

00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:23,740
so I'm so a little bit different topic

00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,060
and let's talk a bit about vendors so

00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:27,490
Christina do and talk a little bit about

00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:29,740
how you have sort of integrated vendors

00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:31,540
into your process and where you hire

00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:35,200
them what sorts of things you use that

00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:38,200
for so we're hosting all of our Drupal

00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,030
sites in the cloud with aqua and so they

00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,480
handle the hosting but we still manage

00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,790
our own

00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,619
code so they're not gonna troubleshoot

00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:46,540
or they're not gonna do any development

00:43:44,619 --> 00:43:48,100
for us or write us any modules but they

00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,950
can help us troubleshoot if there are

00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:53,530
problems we also have a fairly hefty

00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:55,359
support package with aqueous remember

00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:57,700
earlier I mentioned that on the

00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:01,480
technical lead for our team I'm actually

00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:03,400
also the only technical role um so that

00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,900
is where aqueous support comes in I

00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,340
gives you the opportunity to come to

00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,140
events like this and not have to be

00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:10,390
glued to my email the whole time in case

00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:11,500
things just go horribly horribly wrong

00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:14,140
with the sites

00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:16,600
um and so this works fairly well for us

00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:19,210
or very well for us because with aqueon

00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,830
handling the hosting we can focus on

00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:23,590
what we're good at which is building

00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:25,630
beautiful usable websites and when we

00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:27,970
decided to switch to Drupal we actually

00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:31,300
did spec out a scenario where we hosted

00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:33,850
on campus but in that sense we did that

00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:35,740
we'd have to beef up our resources and

00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:38,290
web services we'd have to hire a few

00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:40,330
more of me and also our systems team

00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:43,450
would also have to hire more people and

00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:46,300
increase their skills so in that sense

00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:48,730
even just with staffing resources alone

00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:51,460
it was actually less expensive to host

00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:55,750
in the cloud with Acquia then to host

00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:57,310
internally on campus okay John you want

00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:00,150
to talk a little bit about hosting our

00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:02,410
hosting environment at Stanford sure

00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:04,210
with regards to vendors or just our

00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:06,760
hosting environment our hosting right we

00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:09,280
can come back to hiring vendors so for

00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:12,100
Stanford sites we host internally we

00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,619
have an infrastructure team that

00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:16,990
maintains the hosting environment and we

00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:18,520
the the Drupal team the Web Services

00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:20,260
team takes care of the drupal level of

00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,550
the stack basically that without getting

00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:24,670
too technical the infrastructure team

00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:25,930
runs everything up to the lamp section

00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:29,920
of the stack and then the application

00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:32,800
layer is us and that's all that's all

00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,109
hosted internal we also have so that's

00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,090
Stanford Sites and end users the only

00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:38,680
interaction that they have with that is

00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:40,690
through the web UI through the Drupal UI

00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,790
so can't add custom themes can't add

00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:44,260
custom modules we do review what gets

00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:46,300
added to the central stack and we do

00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:52,600
continually add things that Stanford

00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:53,710
Sites there's also a a open web hosting

00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:57,190
environment the

00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:59,740
dub dub dub servers the www servers that

00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:01,900
anyone that have a cgi-bin space and

00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:06,160
anyone any group any individual can run

00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:09,490
PHP Perl my sequel anything that'll run

00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,109
on the lamp stack and that was actually

00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:12,640
that open environment was really what

00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:15,970
led to a lot of the innovation at

00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:18,400
Stanford and that still is ongoing and

00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:20,619
is still a viable option for people to

00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,329
host Drupal what we realized pretty

00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:24,609
quickly with that hosting environment is

00:46:22,329 --> 00:46:26,740
that keeping up with with patches and

00:46:24,609 --> 00:46:28,390
maintenance and updates for Drupal was a

00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:30,520
real challenge on that and that was what

00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:34,809
led us to build this more software as a

00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:36,369
service platform yeah so on a related

00:46:34,809 --> 00:46:38,349
end or unrelated note do you want to

00:46:36,369 --> 00:46:41,079
talk about how how we've hired vendors

00:46:38,349 --> 00:46:43,569
to supplement our team occasionally sure

00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:46,630
so Stanford has a pretty long history of

00:46:43,569 --> 00:46:48,609
hiring Drupal vendors at least as far

00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:51,760
back as 2007 when I first started

00:46:48,609 --> 00:46:53,290
getting involved and there was a lot

00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,750
because Stanford so decentralized there

00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:58,030
were a lot of vendor contracts happening

00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:59,440
and vendor builds happening on campus

00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:01,030
that there wasn't a lot of transparency

00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,680
or any communication to the rest of

00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:04,329
campus what was happening and so a

00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,099
number of people have started to see

00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:08,859
this and see the the inefficiency of

00:47:06,099 --> 00:47:10,900
that model and over the years various

00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:12,490
initiatives have tried to really write

00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:14,020
the ship and that's one of the things

00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:16,319
that led to the creation of Stanford Web

00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:18,730
Services there was a Provost efficiency

00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:20,799
initiative and one of the proposals was

00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:22,299
hey you know we're spending all this

00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:23,680
money on vendors and not getting a lot

00:47:22,299 --> 00:47:25,480
out of it maybe we should be doing some

00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,099
of this in-house that's not to cast

00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,450
dispersions on any particular vendors

00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:29,710
although if you come up to me after the

00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:35,260
session I'll be happy to cast aspersions

00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:37,480
on particular so we still do work a lot

00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:39,069
with external vendors there's no way

00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,940
that's never web services like I said

00:47:39,069 --> 00:47:41,859
there's no way we could do everything

00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:44,200
web at the University what we really

00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:46,240
focus on and what is my colleagues act

00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:48,099
Chandler's main role is working with

00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,710
vendors to work at Stanford and say hey

00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:52,660
you guys do good work

00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:55,329
we're excited to work with you your top

00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:56,799
Drupal shop we want you to bang out this

00:47:55,329 --> 00:47:58,119
Dean of research site we want you to

00:47:56,799 --> 00:48:00,369
knock it out of the park we want you

00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:03,040
also to roll back the code that you're

00:48:00,369 --> 00:48:04,720
doing open source this code make it a

00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,890
value to the rest of the university and

00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,319
we've done that with

00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:09,700
with with vendor work so dean of

00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,619
research is one that we've rolled back

00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:13,539
some of the policy stuff they're working

00:48:11,619 --> 00:48:16,809
on there's another vendor that's working

00:48:13,539 --> 00:48:19,059
on our central faculty database a drupal

00:48:16,809 --> 00:48:21,069
module to that to interact with that api

00:48:19,059 --> 00:48:22,839
open sourcing that as well making that

00:48:21,069 --> 00:48:24,849
open to the rest of the community so

00:48:22,839 --> 00:48:27,039
it's not about just reducing costs it's

00:48:24,849 --> 00:48:28,900
about increasing value so we're willing

00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:30,489
to spend the money but man we really

00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,769
want to get the bank the best bang for

00:48:30,489 --> 00:48:34,089
our buck

00:48:31,769 --> 00:48:36,219
additionally in stanford web services we

00:48:34,089 --> 00:48:37,930
do the same thing when we can't when we

00:48:36,219 --> 00:48:39,160
want to build extra functionality and we

00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:42,039
just don't have the bandwidth to do it

00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:44,109
we'll contract on an external vendor say

00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:45,849
hey we want you to build this sub-site

00:48:44,109 --> 00:48:47,499
functionality or whatever and hey we

00:48:45,849 --> 00:48:48,700
want to open-source it and the awesome

00:48:47,499 --> 00:48:50,890
thing about the drupal community the

00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:52,539
drupal vendor community is that you know

00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:54,999
the good shops because they're the ones

00:48:52,539 --> 00:48:59,079
who have their devs contributing back to

00:48:54,999 --> 00:49:01,089
core maintaining contributing the work

00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:02,589
that they do for you as a client I don't

00:49:01,089 --> 00:49:05,289
know how many people saw Jesus blog

00:49:02,589 --> 00:49:06,670
posts from yesterday about giving ok

00:49:05,289 --> 00:49:10,809
Sean saw it Sean and I are the only

00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:14,199
people in the room beside Driss posted

00:49:10,809 --> 00:49:18,940
yesterday a proposal to provide credit

00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:21,160
to shops and customers who contribute

00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:22,900
back to open source and it was a pretty

00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:26,079
lightweight lightweight way of beginning

00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:27,759
to gather that data and then the the

00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,319
proposal is let's do something with that

00:49:27,759 --> 00:49:31,119
data once we start to gather that so I

00:49:29,319 --> 00:49:32,680
would suggest everybody go take a look

00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:34,630
at Jesus blog I don't remember the name

00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:37,930
of the blog post but it's a it's a great

00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:40,209
way to contribute back to open source so

00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:42,549
we've put together some resources for

00:49:40,209 --> 00:49:44,140
you guys just product descriptions or

00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:47,949
user guides things like that so these

00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:50,499
are all on the the session in that

00:49:47,949 --> 00:49:52,660
comment so you can go ahead and and

00:49:50,499 --> 00:49:54,459
click on these if you're interested we

00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:57,430
have our github accounts there so you

00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:59,259
can look at our features if you want but

00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:01,509
it's time for questions so what

00:49:59,259 --> 00:50:06,099
questions do you guys have for us and

00:50:01,509 --> 00:50:07,539
please use the microphone if you will hi

00:50:06,099 --> 00:50:08,859
there so I kind of want to continue off

00:50:07,539 --> 00:50:10,119
of what you're saying John and maybe

00:50:08,859 --> 00:50:13,299
hear from some of your other folks

00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:16,779
obviously open scholar is is open source

00:50:13,299 --> 00:50:19,069
but can you talk about how you in your

00:50:16,779 --> 00:50:22,279
university have made the decision

00:50:19,069 --> 00:50:25,249
or if you had to persuade up or whoever

00:50:22,279 --> 00:50:28,430
to say that this is okay to contribute

00:50:25,249 --> 00:50:31,459
to open source specifically GPL 2 and

00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:34,309
you know maybe 3 or something we've had

00:50:31,459 --> 00:50:36,589
the experience that that's been kind of

00:50:34,309 --> 00:50:38,299
a non-starter in a lot of ways and

00:50:36,589 --> 00:50:40,130
there's been a lot of kind of

00:50:38,299 --> 00:50:42,109
uncertainty about using that so how have

00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:43,819
you made the decision to contribute back

00:50:42,109 --> 00:50:47,329
have you made the decision to contribute

00:50:43,819 --> 00:50:49,160
back and how have you convinced or what

00:50:47,329 --> 00:50:50,839
are the reasonings that you find that

00:50:49,160 --> 00:51:00,199
benefits the university for you to do

00:50:50,839 --> 00:51:02,089
that we don't have something like open

00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:05,059
scholar that we can contribute back but

00:51:02,089 --> 00:51:06,829
in our work in working with Drupal you

00:51:05,059 --> 00:51:09,589
know we make patches to things and we

00:51:06,829 --> 00:51:11,479
have built modules and everything every

00:51:09,589 --> 00:51:12,650
module that is I shouldn't say every

00:51:11,479 --> 00:51:14,989
because there are some that are custom

00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:17,809
and unique just to Yale but any module

00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:20,749
that is created to add functionality of

00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:22,519
this site has to be go through the

00:51:20,749 --> 00:51:24,859
community and available to the community

00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:27,529
as a Drupal module we can't just build

00:51:24,859 --> 00:51:29,059
one locally on your site and and just

00:51:27,529 --> 00:51:31,309
expect to use it for just that and

00:51:29,059 --> 00:51:34,219
that's that's the most I think that that

00:51:31,309 --> 00:51:35,749
we've been able to do did you have to

00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:37,249
convince somebody about that or do you

00:51:35,749 --> 00:51:38,749
just do that anyway and you never really

00:51:37,249 --> 00:51:40,640
asked permission No yeah we didn't have

00:51:38,749 --> 00:51:42,829
to convince anybody because it was part

00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,410
of our work it was just the way we did

00:51:42,829 --> 00:51:46,640
it from the beginning yeah

00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:48,229
and I don't think in Stanford we've had

00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,609
a lot of pushback against that I mean

00:51:48,229 --> 00:51:51,859
we're in the heart of Silicon Valley an

00:51:49,609 --> 00:51:53,569
open source free and open source

00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:55,640
software as part of the part of the DNA

00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:57,890
but there certainly are stakeholders

00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,630
that we that do need to be convinced and

00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:01,039
we you know some of the selling points

00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:02,660
are look at all the value that you're

00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:04,249
getting from this open source community

00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:07,670
you're getting free support free

00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:09,799
software and that kind of makes a

00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:11,359
business case in terms of committing

00:52:09,799 --> 00:52:13,609
back and we've had a lot of success with

00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:15,769
even with our clients going back to them

00:52:13,609 --> 00:52:17,719
and saying hey we built this feature for

00:52:15,769 --> 00:52:18,949
you do you mind if we repurpose this for

00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:20,180
other people on campus and they're like

00:52:18,949 --> 00:52:22,339
wow that's great that would be awesome

00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:25,500
so that's something else that works well

00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:29,370
yeah please

00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:31,740
so I run a gerbil agency in Boston who

00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:34,590
serves higher ed primarily including

00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:37,020
Harvard and MIT and it's so great to

00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:39,750
hear about the move towards software as

00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:42,630
a service to be able to scale this but

00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:44,880
we run across clients for whom that's

00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:46,080
not going to serve their needs they need

00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,000
something more custom

00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:50,580
so I'm curious to hear more from all of

00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,560
you about the best way that vendors and

00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:54,420
Drupal shops can better sort of

00:52:52,560 --> 00:53:04,170
complement and support the services that

00:52:54,420 --> 00:53:06,690
you're providing because we struggle

00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:10,380
with having to once the site's being

00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:12,660
built by a vendor who supports it after

00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:15,000
it's done it seems to be you know the

00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:16,770
client the department whoever it is

00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,590
feels like oh well great now I have

00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:21,690
built this you know little thing that's

00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:23,820
so important and special but then who is

00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:26,790
going to support it so that has been a

00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:29,880
struggle for us because we don't have

00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:31,980
the bandwidth to support you know custom

00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:34,440
built sites so that's why we have such a

00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:36,690
big push to build off of open scholar

00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,070
and so we're only maintaining a module

00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:40,320
here a module there feature here a

00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:44,130
feature there a special search something

00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:46,920
something here so that's why we don't

00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:49,080
tend to want to go down that path

00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,990
because I think the expectation is just

00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:53,490
that we're gonna pay you know hundreds

00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:57,060
of thousands of dollars for a custom

00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:59,700
site but then hey Harvard University IT

00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:02,490
support me you know and help me maintain

00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:05,610
this over years to come so it's

00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:07,350
difficult go ahead and I can speak to

00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:09,480
that that we have certain standards that

00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:11,310
our Drupal partners have to follow we

00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,990
all the sites aren't necessarily built

00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:15,660
by our Drupal partners but they quickly

00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:18,570
learn that we usually try and get in

00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:20,340
front of in front of them before they

00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:22,320
start building because we do have a

00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:24,240
specific way in which sites can be built

00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,740
they can't create their own custom

00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,950
modules of course they're not supposed

00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:30,570
to hack or the the biggest problem that

00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:32,310
we have with that is that people will

00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:34,080
hire people who say they know Drupal and

00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:35,810
don't and so that's part of the reason

00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,430
why we have the Drupal partners list

00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:39,860
because we know that anyone on that list

00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:43,340
is that Drupal enthusiast and also

00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:44,870
understands the Yale sites platform but

00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:47,710
we do have certain standards that they

00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:50,030
have to follow and they're usually on

00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:53,060
boarded before they they start the

00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:55,100
project so what I might say to that at

00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:57,200
Stanford what we found is that if it

00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:59,690
what she was saying if you can make up a

00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,800
collaboration with the web services team

00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:03,620
and at the university that you're

00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:05,960
working at that can help you because

00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:08,780
they often know how to leverage

00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:10,730
on-campus technologies so we have our

00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:13,310
hosting platform and vendors can build

00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:15,320
on our platform but it's trickier

00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,190
because they can't get into the code but

00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,900
we've had some very successful

00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:19,940
collaborations where vendors have come

00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,620
in they've built a custom site and it's

00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:23,870
on our platform so we know that they're

00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:25,340
getting updates and everything is being

00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:26,750
managed well and into the future so I

00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:28,670
think that's the balance that needs to

00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:30,350
be struck with this is that we want to

00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:33,230
make sure that if a vendor is coming in

00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:35,360
that that there's a decent support plan

00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:36,680
for that site and be frank with them

00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:38,240
about the total cost of ownership with

00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,920
their website it's not just the the

00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,020
bottom-line dollar amount of building it

00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,640
it's like you need to figure out you

00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:44,840
client need to figure out where you're

00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,730
gonna host this thing and how much it's

00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:49,310
gonna cost you for support over the long

00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:50,810
term yeah yeah cuz it sounds like for

00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:52,730
any of you guys if someone needed a

00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:54,080
really custom thing that was very

00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:55,670
outside of the box they would pretty

00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:57,260
much be responsible for finding their

00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:59,990
own hosting and support it wouldn't

00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:01,580
that's not true it yes okay we haven't

00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:03,890
build it in our yell sites environment

00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:05,720
but we have the custom site has to be

00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:08,000
built so that if the vendor walks away

00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:09,680
because that's a but not intentionally

00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,910
yeah but it's a strong possibility that

00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,590
something's gonna happen and that

00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:14,900
relationships gonna get broken whether

00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:16,400
it's because the vendor no longer exists

00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:18,680
or because somebody doesn't have the

00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,960
budget so when they build a site they

00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:23,870
have to they have to set it up so that

00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,520
once somebody gets new staff and they

00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:28,250
come to training they're just going to

00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:32,120
content add content or content edit and

00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:34,250
and those are the kind of standards that

00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:36,500
we have to make sure that even if it's a

00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:40,270
custom site the backend still remains

00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:45,760
the same right yeah thanks

00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:49,510
a great job all your presenting a real

00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:51,460
quick question on kind of privacy and

00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:53,410
what you guys are running up against it

00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:56,170
might maybe lean towards maybe some of

00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:59,380
the self-serve things that that you guys

00:56:56,170 --> 00:57:02,170
do but I'm curious if you guys could

00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:04,810
maybe speak to how you deal with content

00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:07,540
coming in from maybe student population

00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:09,610
that could have copyright stuff or like

00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:11,530
if you guys are doing anything special

00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:23,320
their friend we want to want to talk to

00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:27,940
that that would be many of our public

00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:30,010
facing websites and yeah it basically is

00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:40,090
sort of like don't take other people's

00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:43,180
stuff it is very big enforcing we have

00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:45,220
we have various data classifications we

00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:46,630
don't and I'm sure that every

00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:48,370
institution has this but we have

00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:50,650
confidential restricted prohibited data

00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:52,900
and so the only types of information

00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:54,220
that we deal with on our platforms it's

00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:55,990
a content management system so this is

00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,580
one of the things that we try to consult

00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:59,410
with people with clients at the very

00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:01,060
beginning like this is a content

00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:03,220
management system this should not be

00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:05,200
this is used for building public facing

00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:07,000
websites this is used for putting out

00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,100
information that you want to be public

00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,630
so if you want to build an intranet with

00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:12,730
Drupal you can do that but it's probably

00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:14,290
not the best tool and so we have a

00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:15,700
pretty we have a strict policy and not

00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:17,590
even pretty straight a strict policy of

00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,030
no restricted or prohibited data on our

00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:22,120
sites because they're just not rated for

00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:24,430
it we have a small bit of pin

00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:25,990
authentication built into our site

00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:28,150
depending on what kind of permission or

00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:29,800
site visibility you set it at so we

00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:32,290
could you can set your site to Harvard

00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,970
only but again it's not for high risk

00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:38,440
confidential information it's for more

00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:43,190
Harvard only classified information

00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:45,710
nothing FERPA related obviously so

00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:48,890
yeah actually so we have actually for

00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:50,960
that kind of private information we have

00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:52,730
those sorts of guidelines also like

00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,260
don't put any information that you

00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:55,850
wouldn't want the world to see on your

00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:58,910
website we do have some things that are

00:58:55,850 --> 00:59:00,470
locked down behind authentication but

00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:02,030
even then it shouldn't be things like

00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:05,720
Social Security numbers or medical

00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:07,820
anything or that we also integrate that

00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:09,560
as part of user training we had some

00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:12,230
content editors who would copy entire

00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:13,310
articles from like New York Times that

00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:14,840
their faculty members happened to be

00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:16,880
mentioned in to sort of like posted on

00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:18,770
the website without attribution and so

00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,840
we've been trying to integrate those

00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:30,260
sorts of best practices or in that case

00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:32,450
like worst practice several of you

00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:36,140
mentioned documentation is a big part of

00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:38,540
your service and I'm wondering a couple

00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:41,090
things one is where exactly are you

00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:45,020
storing that is it on a Drupal site or

00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:46,460
another tool or service and then kind of

00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:48,020
how much of its public how much of its

00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:50,720
private and for those of you that have a

00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:52,970
more fractured environment how you're

00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:55,250
actually how you're coordinating and

00:59:52,970 --> 01:00:10,430
standardizing documentation and sharing

00:59:55,250 --> 01:00:18,230
it our public facing documentation is on

01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:20,810
Drupal sites I will say that Stanford

01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:22,370
Web Services is looking into potentially

01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:24,230
doing something that's a bit more robust

01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:25,730
maybe with like a Zendesk option or

01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:27,710
something like that but we it's still

01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:28,190
experimental we haven't rolled it out in

01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:29,720
any way

01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:38,510
yeah and we're just using the book

01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:40,490
module nothing fancy hi so it sounds

01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:42,440
like you provide centralized web

01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:46,040
services that are available to anybody

01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:50,180
within your university so my question is

01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:52,880
to part one do you have web services

01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:54,890
teams that work for individual schools

01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,610
and colleges and other entities and two

01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:57,560
if

01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:59,180
what is your working relationship with

01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,370
them and how do they fit into the

01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:02,210
workflow process

01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:03,680
John you won't talk about that sure

01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:07,070
we're not even the biggest drupal team

01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:14,420
at Stanford or the most technically

01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:16,550
savvy yeah we partner with there are it

01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:18,530
ranges everything from a single Drupal

01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:19,850
developer in a small unit to a full

01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:21,980
Drupal team like at the Graduate School

01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:23,930
of Business and we work with them in

01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:28,970
various ways we'll share code we'll

01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:30,290
share tactics we'll share all sorts of

01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:32,360
stuff and so it just kind of depends on

01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:33,650
what what their needs are at the time

01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:36,500
what we can provide and then what they

01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:38,870
can provide for us it's it's open source

01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:40,820
it's the community so we're one minute

01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:42,830
over I'm gonna encourage you to come up

01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:44,780
and ask your question is that okay yeah

01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:48,400
that's totally cool all right thanks

01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:48,400
