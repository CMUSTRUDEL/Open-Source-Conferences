- the reason we're all here since

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,049
starting Drupal in his dorm room roughly

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,120
15 years ago or so

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,639
Jesus vision and leadership has grown

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,099
Drupal from a custom CMS to the

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,470
enterprise software it is today he's

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,720
passionate about the web open source and

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,760
photography is there obviously original

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,680
creator and lead of Drupal it's also the

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,990
co-founder and chief technology officer

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,460
of Acquia a venture-backed software

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,500
company that offers products and

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,390
services for drupal so please help us

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,390
welcome the man himself Therese

00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:47,359
thank you Eric

00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:51,350
congratulations Kathy good morning

00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:55,120
everyone thanks for getting up early to

00:00:51,350 --> 00:01:00,019
be in this keynote as Eric mentioned I

00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:03,019
love photography and so here is a photo

00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:06,649
an image or a drawing for this culty

00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:09,259
photo photographic apparatus and it's

00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:10,970
sort of one of the early early cameras

00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:14,659
that existed and so if you look at the

00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:17,000
manual of the photographic apparatus it

00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:19,190
has a lot of different steps a lot of

00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,530
manual steps steps done by many

00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,850
different people even like you see women

00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,460
and man

00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:28,460
basically all working together to make

00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,860
one one photo and so as a lot of work it

00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:34,159
wasn't easy to take a photo with this

00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:37,280
thing and yet it got adopted right the

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,549
invention of the photo was so big that

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,560
it actually did get adopted and so a

00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:46,700
little bit later along came the Kodak

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,219
and as you can see it already looks a

00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:52,579
lot simpler and so what they actually

00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:53,780
did this is an ad from Kodak and one of

00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:56,780
the things you'll see is that they have

00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:59,149
this notion of you press the button and

00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,920
we do the rest and it sort of

00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:03,530
encapsulates how they simplify it

00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,670
photography and actually on a quick side

00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,950
note it actually works a little bit like

00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,229
cloud computing so you would take a

00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,000
photo and then you would ship the film

00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,010
to a factory and they would actually

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,510
develop the film and then ship it you

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,820
know ship the photo back to you and so a

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,870
lot of the complexity was sort of out

00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:22,510
sourced and abstracted in the clouds

00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:25,420
and of course the history of photography

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:28,310
has many many steps and along the way

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:32,060
things change drastically and you know

00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,410
our simplified drastically another thing

00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,920
that happened was the introduction of

00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:40,069
the 35 millimeter film and so that was

00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,959
actually originally invented by Edison

00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:44,209
not sure how many of you knew that and

00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,340
what's interesting about the 35

00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:49,400
millimeter film is that it was actually

00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:52,459
a form of standardization you know we

00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,690
standardized on a common format and as a

00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:56,000
result there was a whole

00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:59,600
Ecosystem boring of different cameras

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,060
nikon canon but also different tools you

00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:05,060
know tools to project photos and you

00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:07,760
know all these kinds of things but it

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,520
also drastically simplified cameras

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,460
again and so if you start to look at the

00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,740
first 35 millimeter camera shown on the

00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,780
on the slide you can see that there are

00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,940
still a lot of steps involved you need

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,490
it to load the film and you need to make

00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:25,640
a photo unload the film develop the film

00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:28,100
and large it print it and eventually

00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,930
could you know store it keep it and

00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,000
share it with your friends or your

00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:35,210
family and so if you look at the history

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,070
of the camera camera beyond that you see

00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:40,130
that every single iteration of the

00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:42,260
camera essentially replaced one or more

00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:45,950
steps and so with the introduction of

00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:49,190
the Instamatic enlarging and printing

00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:53,000
was replaced by you know developing film

00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:55,610
in a store and with the Polaroid

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,220
basically you no longer had to unload

00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:01,310
the film like it was directly developed

00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:04,489
there for you and so at the time people

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:06,830
thought that the Polaroid was it it was

00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:09,830
the easiest simplest camera that we

00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,600
could ever invent right and so they felt

00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:14,480
like we plateaued it couldn't be made

00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,100
simpler and yet you know with the

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,020
introduction of digital cameras

00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,959
you didn't need film at all so you

00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,940
didn't need to load the film and yet it

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,090
wasn't still optimized for sharing and

00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,580
so you know most lately of course with

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,860
the with the iPhone or other smart for

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,530
phones you can just you know shoot

00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,600
photos and they're instantly shared like

00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,580
with things like photo streaming and

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,280
these kinds of things and so eventually

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,590
over you know more than 100 years we

00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,690
were able to simplify this huge process

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:47,000
with all these people all these

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:52,280
different steps into something which

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,990
because became you know much simpler so

00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,150
that's really interesting to me because

00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,760
I feel there's a lot of relevance to

00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:01,940
what we do and what's also interesting

00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:04,400
is that with every step along the way it

00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:07,159
actually became easier for the end user

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,129
but the complexity under the hood

00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:12,800
drastically increased right if you think

00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:14,449
about a digital camera as all sorts of

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,449
you know things going on hardware

00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:19,909
software JPEG compared to the initial

00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:22,459
camera which was just in a basic

00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:27,529
chemistry just to simplify things a

00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:29,059
little bit and so for that kind of

00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:32,139
innovation for that kind of

00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:34,759
simplification and evolution to happen

00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:37,279
we needed all sorts of innovations and

00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:39,439
so obviously before cameras could exist

00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:43,129
we needed to invent optics you know and

00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:45,769
and that led to telescopes and after

00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:48,979
that we needed to invent technologies

00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:52,039
like chemistry and silver nitrate which

00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:56,379
led to the creation of a camera would we

00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:59,899
take one photo a single print camera

00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:01,969
next we invent the things like printing

00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:03,879
and plastics which led to film cameras

00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:06,709
which we take multiple photos and

00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:09,139
eventually you know things like

00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:11,479
electronics and LCD screens and sensors

00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:13,969
led to the digital camera so there's

00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:17,179
these big technologies that need to come

00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:21,979
together for us to make the transition

00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:25,759
from one phase to the next phase and of

00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:27,769
course the same is true you know with

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,009
regards to the web like if you think

00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:33,889
back first we needed to invent HTML and

00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:36,199
HTTP in a browser and that gear gave

00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:39,189
birth to the static web where we could

00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:41,800
share information with each other online

00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:46,159
and it wasn't until five years later

00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:48,679
around 95 the technologies like PHP and

00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:50,029
MySQL and Apache and Linux game about

00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:53,149
them so they're magically sort of

00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:55,129
emerged around the same time and it

00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:58,610
really lets the recreation of what what

00:06:55,129 --> 00:07:00,289
I call the dynamic web um the dynamic

00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,749
dynamic web was huge because it gave

00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:04,879
birth to Drupal like Drupal would not

00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:07,569
have been invented if it wasn't for

00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:10,249
these technologies to be invented first

00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:14,029
and so if you look at how dynamic

00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:15,919
websites are built you know they're

00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:18,079
pretty complex right if you know some of

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,300
you probably remember this actually many

00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:23,150
of you still live in that era

00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,430
with your sites where you have to define

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,800
the database schemas you have to build

00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:30,200
your own authentication system you have

00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:36,050
to write your own queries there's a lot

00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:40,220
of complexity involved and so what

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:43,010
happened next is that you know CMS's

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,780
were boring solutions like Drupal sort

00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,760
of led to the creation of you know what

00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,130
I refer to as the assembled web where

00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,920
you have modules and themes and web

00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:54,830
services and effectively what it did it

00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,440
created this very complex experience and

00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:59,120
it simplified it to something that is

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,670
much easier where you have a core

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,100
platform you have modules your themes

00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:06,500
and you can download and install them

00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,080
and configure them and then you're

00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,870
basically good to go it's a huge

00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,360
evolution which would not have been

00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:16,700
possible without some of the other steps

00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,640
along the way and so of course the

00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:22,190
question is what happens after the

00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,410
assembled web right what is the next big

00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:26,750
thing that we need to chase what is the

00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:30,290
next big simplification just like with

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:33,530
the camera that we need to meet to bet

00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:39,350
on and so I want to talk a little bit

00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:42,140
about that in this keynote all right and

00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:43,910
so personally I'm very very excited

00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,570
about what's happening in the world

00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:49,520
today you know if you think about how

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,500
evolution happens there's all of these

00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,300
technologies coming together and I feel

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,640
like today we have a whole bunch of

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,920
exciting technologies that they don't

00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,870
exist five years ago just like you know

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,030
PHP and MySQL didn't exist when we

00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,580
started with the static weapon so we

00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:06,470
have things like augmented reality we

00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,110
have things like machine learning that

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:12,080
are very hot topics we have things like

00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:15,110
wearable technology Google glass and

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:19,490
others things like near-field

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:22,670
communication with IBM crypto currencies

00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:23,990
like Bitcoin we have drones Paulie

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:27,010
mentioned there may be drones flying

00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:30,320
around later but also geolocation

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,760
personalization and social login and

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,279
they're kind of a big deal like just

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,050
think about uber an uber is a

00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:37,699
you know as you guys know it's it's a

00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,430
company which is extremely disruptive

00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:42,649
because it uses geolocation and

00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:44,959
personalization like it knows where you

00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:46,670
are it knows where the drivers are and

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,220
therefore it can disrupt an entire

00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:51,649
industry and so think about what some of

00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,149
these technologies could mean for your

00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:55,850
business and how they could

00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:57,800
revolutionize what you do today and so

00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,800
more than ever I feel like there's this

00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:03,399
whole slew of new things which just were

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,319
invented but weren't necessarily

00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,749
mainstream ian's so active at the verge

00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:12,860
of these things becoming widely spread

00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:15,470
and so just like the way PHP and MySQL

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,480
and Linux and Apache came together I

00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,990
feel like all or some of these

00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,839
technologies will come together as well

00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:27,079
to basically get us through the next the

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,029
next in a wave in the web and so I

00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:30,709
believe that we're at the beginning the

00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:33,620
early early beginnings of the fourth

00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:36,019
wave of the web which I call the

00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,660
experience web and so I want to talk a

00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:40,639
little bit about that but first I want

00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,439
to I want to caveat that we've been

00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,120
working on this vision for the assembled

00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:46,730
web for over ten years

00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,860
I know but we've been working on this

00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:51,139
for a long time and we're not quite done

00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:54,259
yet either there is more work that we

00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:56,120
need to do and you experience what may

00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:58,490
not happen overnight either it may take

00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:02,899
us 10 years as well to basically fulfill

00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:05,480
that vision of where to go next so what

00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:07,939
is the experience web and I want to give

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,689
you two examples one is around Commerce

00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:13,490
and two is around search alright and so

00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:17,029
if you if you want to buy something

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:19,459
today you know you may start from a

00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:21,620
catalog you see a dress or you know

00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:23,860
something that you like and so usually

00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:26,149
what you do is to go to their website

00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,189
then you start looking for the product

00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:31,610
which there's a lot of products on that

00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:36,399
website once you find it you add it to

00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:38,629
your cart you have to create an account

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,929
next step is you need to enter your

00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:43,759
payment information you have to enter

00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:46,699
your shipping information if the enter

00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,840
your billing information finally review

00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:49,700
the order and then

00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,910
you hit submit and so what happens next

00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:55,130
it gets shipped essentially and you know

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:59,390
you wait another three to five days or

00:11:55,130 --> 00:12:02,260
more for that product to to be delivered

00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:06,050
and so a lot of different steps involved

00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:08,600
let me get a water real quick and so the

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:14,630
question is what would that experience

00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:20,900
look like in the future excuse me

00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:22,580
and so this is pretty exciting so here's

00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:26,950
all the ten steps of today's experience

00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:29,420
it's exciting because the commerce

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,730
industry as a whole you know offline and

00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:34,700
online commerce is roughly is almost

00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:37,490
five trillion dollars it's you know like

00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:39,770
its massive right and only or less than

00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,170
six percent of all the commerce in the

00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:45,140
world happens online today there is a

00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:48,320
massive opportunity for Drupal or for

00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:52,070
the web to basically embrace ecommerce

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,770
and what limits people from buying

00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:56,540
things online today is the experience

00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,580
like all these steps get in the way

00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,860
there's also physical things that get in

00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,720
the way like you know you can feel the

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,760
fabric of something that you want to buy

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,700
but on the flip side there's also

00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,680
advantages to the web like you know when

00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,960
you walk into a physical store they

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,600
don't know anything about you versus

00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,350
online people actually may know a whole

00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,700
lot about you so they're straight ups

00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:22,400
and so if we start to think about what

00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:25,280
can we eliminate in this experience to

00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,140
make ecommerce go easier there is a

00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:31,490
massive opportunity in terms of

00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:33,970
capturing that market and so imagine we

00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,860
had some sort of magical identity server

00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:39,560
and so imagine having going through a

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,020
website and never ever ever having to

00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,150
create an account you can follows you

00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,770
you go to the website and with one

00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:49,700
simple click you can actually create an

00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:52,340
account imagine if a you know an

00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,320
electronic wallet was attached to that

00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,850
identity server and now you never ever

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,150
have to enter your payment information

00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:00,650
you never ever have to enter

00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:02,930
you're you know your billing information

00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:06,620
your shipping information and all of

00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:08,510
these things and so effectively we could

00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,010
take a whole bunch of steps out of the

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:12,050
process and that would be huge that

00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:14,030
would be a huge invention that I don't

00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:16,820
believe that I don't believe exists

00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:19,010
today but you know even further in the

00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,350
future we may be able to eliminate more

00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:24,830
steps you know we talked about drones we

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:26,870
talked about self-driving cars you know

00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,280
now all of a sudden these things are no

00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,740
longer dependent on humans and could

00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:34,820
start driving or flying you know at

00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:36,830
night right and so things like drones

00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,420
are pretty interesting and Amazon is

00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:41,620
actually doing interesting things here

00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:44,600
as well they've started to pre ship

00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,910
items from one warehouse to another

00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,250
warehouse that is physically closer to

00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,780
you if they can predict with a certain

00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,820
level of certainty that you're going to

00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,510
buy this product so they're already

00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:58,370
starting to do some of these things to

00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:01,400
you know reduce shipping times and to

00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:03,880
improve the e-commerce experience but

00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:07,220
what if every item in the world had been

00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:10,400
RFID or what if we have really strong

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:13,370
image recognition and so now I'm wearing

00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,440
my Google glass I can just look at

00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,540
something like maybe I really like that

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,900
bottle of water and I can say buy me a

00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:23,150
bottle of water right and you know

00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:29,240
Google can just go ahead and buy that

00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:30,800
for me and so this is starting to look

00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,390
really really interesting because it

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,850
again just like with the camera it

00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,140
eliminates all of these steps and so the

00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,670
experience could pretty much look like

00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:40,370
this so you're hanging out with your

00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:46,040
friends you see wow what a nice jacket

00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:49,570
let me say glass buy me a jacket and you

00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,570
know basically glass is smart enough

00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:56,480
let's see is it showing it's smart

00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,370
enough like it knows you know you can

00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,900
identify where the jacket comes from it

00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:01,880
knows your size because it has your

00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,560
profile it says are you're a medium and

00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,030
it knows it's in a warehouse in your bag

00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,300
so it says I can deliver this

00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:11,610
immediately and you say to class by now

00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:14,130
all right and you know glass buys it and

00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,899
thirty minute laters it will basically

00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:18,540
be delivered wherever you are because

00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:21,300
glass knows where you are thanks to

00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:23,399
things like geolocation and so basically

00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:28,290
there is this opportunity to go from one

00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:29,970
click purchase to one blink purchase and

00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:33,600
I think it will happen I think it will

00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:36,089
happen but what's interesting about this

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,390
story is what is the role for Drupal in

00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:43,500
this because nowhere did you go to a

00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:46,410
website you didn't go online you didn't

00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:49,020
look at products you didn't have to fill

00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:51,089
anything out in a form and so magically

00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,649
these things started to work and just

00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:55,890
like with the camera this may be the

00:16:52,649 --> 00:17:04,439
optimal experience so let's look at the

00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:08,040
second example which is a search all

00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:09,329
right so this is whoops so this is you

00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,510
know let's go back in time this is

00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:15,420
Google in 2010 you know five years ago

00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:18,240
if you search for Lady Gaga you would

00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:20,640
get this and I first did this with

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,910
another artist but she wasn't an artist

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,439
back then that lets you change it but

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,760
you know imagine you search for Lady

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,210
Gaga it would look like this very

00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:32,070
textual just links no graphics if you do

00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:35,580
the same search today you get exactly

00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:41,190
this all right so you can see some

00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:42,540
images the blinking alright and so in

00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,910
the sidebar if all of this rich

00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,500
information like upcoming events it even

00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:49,500
knows that I'm in Boston it says near

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:53,790
you it has all of the songs it has

00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:55,440
recent Google+ messages that she may

00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:58,100
have posted albums there's all of this

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:02,520
rich information her age or real name

00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:06,150
and so that's a big change in five years

00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:08,010
and so why would Google stop there you

00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,290
know why wouldn't goggle make that

00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:12,240
experience even more compelling and so

00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:15,179
five years from now this could look like

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,850
this and obviously we have to you know

00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:21,030
create a mock-up here but as you can see

00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:23,150
it's much more rich experience it shows

00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:26,030
things like

00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:27,740
you know concerts near you again it

00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:30,830
knows that I'm Boston it knows which

00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:33,470
albums I have it says your albums I have

00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:36,170
those albums it knows that it also knows

00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:37,760
which songs I don't have yet and it has

00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:40,130
a Buy button there so I can buy it

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,230
straight up the Google homepage I don't

00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:45,020
have to go to any other site and then

00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:47,510
Google integrated social and I can chat

00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:50,390
about you know Lady Gaga online on

00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:53,930
google.com and all the way at the bottom

00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:56,270
of course there is still the old sort of

00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:58,810
Google Links and so why wouldn't goggle

00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:01,190
do this this seems to be their natural

00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:02,720
evolution and also in this example it's

00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:05,180
interesting what's ripples roll in this

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,670
website because now I can find a whole

00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:10,490
lot of information about Lady Gaga

00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:13,880
without having to go to Lady Gaga's calm

00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:17,930
by Google effectively gave me all of

00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:21,590
that information so I think I think this

00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:24,290
is a big question for us and so what's

00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,950
happening really is kind of funny in a

00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,080
way

00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:28,700
well it's called disintermediation which

00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,310
is a big word for cutting out middleman

00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,890
and what's interesting what's

00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:35,840
interesting about the web is that the

00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:37,760
web is sort of disintermediating

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,520
brick-and-mortar stores like you know

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,180
Amazon has replaced many bookstores

00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:46,520
obviously there's still bookstores

00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:48,620
iTunes has replaced many CD stores or

00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:52,610
you know digital music has replaced

00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:55,370
traditional CD stores eBay has replaced

00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:57,080
a lot of flea markets things like

00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,810
monster.com has replaced

00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,900
so I guess newspaper ads or you know for

00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:05,360
job postings and so what's happening

00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:08,480
right now it's it's like Google is

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,610
actually disintermediating the web and

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,710
so everything at first everything which

00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,360
had a physical listing was moved online

00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,970
and everything which has an online

00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:23,510
listing Google is starting to to take

00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:27,100
over and so Google can do these things

00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:29,750
Google can build this you know ecommerce

00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:32,090
experience because it basically controls

00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:34,790
all of these pieces it has self-driving

00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:36,320
cars it has drones it has Google glass

00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:39,320
and then

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,730
Klout and you know big data like it has

00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,790
all of the different building blocks to

00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:49,100
build this today the same thing with

00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:50,720
search but of course it's not just

00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,120
Google I don't want to like talk about

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,710
Google all day here it's the same thing

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,110
with the other big platforms like the

00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,790
Facebook's of the world the apples you

00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:01,010
know Amazon and LinkedIn they're like

00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:04,060
basically building these very rich

00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:07,490
experiences which you know users like

00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:09,560
but in doing so they pose some

00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,210
interesting challenges for us so let's

00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,070
talk about what that means for Drupal

00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:17,320
and so it's kind of happening is the

00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:20,480
open web as we know it is closing up

00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:22,580
right the big players are taking over

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,840
more and more of the front end of the

00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:29,030
web and in Drupal sites risk being sort

00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:32,420
of the deep web if you will for lack of

00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:34,190
a better words and at that part in a way

00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,810
is we won't be able to stop it I thought

00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:38,690
really really hard about this I'm I

00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:40,130
couldn't think of a way to stop this and

00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,920
I couldn't think of a way to stop this

00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:45,910
because one it's actually easier for the

00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:48,170
users it's simpler for the users and

00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:50,690
secondly it's actually better for the

00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:52,550
businesses as well and I talked to the

00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:54,770
people that run Lady Gaga at government

00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:57,620
I said it's great Google sends us a lot

00:21:54,770 --> 00:22:00,350
of traffic you know and so it's better

00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:02,500
for users it's better for businesses so

00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:06,230
how would we be able to stop this

00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:08,060
there's some quick examples like you can

00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:10,490
now enter flight destinations straight

00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,380
from Google and Google will give you

00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:15,230
pricing right in the in the main page

00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,160
this one was a creepiest which I I found

00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,020
out by accident

00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,060
oh sorry we'll come later same thing if

00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,980
you look for a camera now all of a

00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:24,860
sudden in the sidebar you have all of

00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,290
these information about cameras right

00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:29,150
and it's very convenient for users

00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:30,740
because I can compare prices something

00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:34,700
that wasn't necessarily easy to do in

00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:36,590
the past plus it's also for the great

00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:41,510
for the companies who were being listed

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:43,520
there all right and so in a way Google

00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:45,200
is becoming the big box of the web it's

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,850
becoming like Best Buy for the web with

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,250
all of these different cameras listed on

00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,570
the front

00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:52,960
which is of course a very powerful

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:57,040
position to beam for the googles of the

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,920
world on the other hand there's a big

00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,240
butt here on the other hand brands don't

00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,060
want to share their customers with

00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:07,330
Google and brands do want to build very

00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:11,260
custom experiences so here's a crazy

00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:14,410
example as I searched on Google my

00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:17,200
recent Amazon purchases and this is what

00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:20,050
showed up because Google connects

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,820
because I'm logged in with Gmail Google

00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,450
actually knows exactly what I bought on

00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,540
Amazon

00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:28,270
I don't think Amazon likes that and so

00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,980
you can see you know you can actually

00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:35,530
drill in and you can see about this

00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:37,480
multi-purpose pastry scraper and a

00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,970
couple of other things but this is a

00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:43,540
real order and you should definitely try

00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:45,610
it out later today it's kinda creepy but

00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,380
it works but think about how Amazon

00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:49,330
feels about that because now Google

00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,890
knows exactly what I bought and why

00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:52,960
wouldn't they inject themselves they're

00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:55,570
like or like next time I try to buy

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,900
something they could easily try to steal

00:23:55,570 --> 00:24:01,780
amazon's customers and so these large

00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:04,060
platforms are kind of like this if these

00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:08,470
like tentacles and multiple eyes let me

00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:10,210
say don't run we are your friends and

00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:11,800
everybody loves their functionality but

00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:15,730
if you look under the hood it's actually

00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:17,410
quite scary about what it all does and

00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:20,140
so brands actually do on the only

00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:22,720
experience that totally want to own the

00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:24,880
experience because if you think about

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,400
Best Buy or other you know big-box

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,320
stores you get all of these scammers and

00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:33,220
there's no differentiation whatsoever

00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:35,140
all you see is a bunch of cameras some

00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,970
pricing and in the best case scenario

00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,940
you get like one or two bullet items

00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:41,020
like these little cards that

00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:43,000
differentiate one product from another

00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:45,010
so imagine companies putting so much

00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,260
effort and energy building better

00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:51,160
products and then once you end up in the

00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:54,040
store its reduced to one bullet item or

00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:56,200
two bullet items and so that I think is

00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,000
a huge opportunity that we have with

00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,090
online commerce we can actually provide

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,390
a lot of great information about each

00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:06,130
each of these products alright

00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:08,550
so brands don't want that they don't

00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:14,710
want to be sort of the online equivalent

00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:18,400
of you know the big-box stores and so on

00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:21,430
such organizations Whole Foods they're

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,470
local here in Austin and they're

00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,820
basically using Drupal to create really

00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:26,620
branded experiences and have a quick

00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,900
video that I would like to show you

00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:32,430
about what Whole Foods is doing with

00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,430
Drupal there we go

00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,570
people who love organic food love the

00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:42,670
experience that we provide them a

00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:44,260
homeless market they love coming to the

00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:46,990
store they love shop within the products

00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:49,120
they love the healthy lifestyle that we

00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:52,450
enable our guests when they come to the

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:55,480
store want to know that this is an

00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,520
experience they appreciate the theater

00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,110
of the store some of the challenges we

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,090
have with the Whole Foods Market comm

00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:03,190
website is creating that one-on-one

00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:04,980
interaction that guests are able to get

00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,450
in the store in a digital environment

00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,370
aesthetically it's very pleasing it is a

00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:10,990
lot like how our stores are the artwork

00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,910
and the creative nature of it are

00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:14,290
beautiful I think that what else we do

00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,940
that's cool is we let the stores

00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,800
customize that you will get a different

00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,540
experience when you visit that web sites

00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:22,000
depending on where you're visiting from

00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:23,620
so the experience you get visiting from

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,260
Las Vegas Nevada is not going to consume

00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,630
when you get

00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,610
Texas you get store-specific content

00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:30,200
you're connected to that store it's not

00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:31,700
a pure commerce site and it's not if

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,780
your content side it's all three of

00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,100
those things right it's about the

00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,800
community and the content and the

00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:39,320
commerce altogether it's been invaluable

00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,210
to be able to tap some of the greatest

00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,980
minds in the community to help us solve

00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,290
problems for a number of years Whole

00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,970
Foods comm was run explicitly as a

00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:49,310
brochure website one of the things that

00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:51,950
Drupal specifically allows us to do is

00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:54,020
to have a lot more control over creating

00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:55,400
that unique experience between customers

00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,830
I think the key things that Drupal

00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:00,650
offers us in the Whole Foods Market comm

00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:03,530
site are the flexibility and ability to

00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:06,020
control our destiny we're able to give

00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:08,030
back literally to a community and build

00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:10,390
an ecosystem that we can continue to be

00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,390
a part of

00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:22,820
pretty awesome because because Whole

00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:26,190
Foods is local and I reached out to

00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,990
Jason B Cole with their CIO the CIO of

00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:30,120
Whole Foods and asked them to be you

00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:31,320
know to comment stage and to give a

00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,300
little bit more background information

00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,240
about what they're doing for a few

00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:40,920
minutes so welcome Jason thanks very

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,450
much as one of the local companies we

00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,070
want to welcome you here to Austin and

00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:45,810
what I want to share with everybody

00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:48,060
today is a sort of three different

00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:49,950
things sort of why we chose Drupal to

00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:53,220
some of the things that we've done in

00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:55,650
three where we plan to go first and

00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:59,160
foremost when we look at selecting

00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:00,840
technology partners and solutions at

00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,330
Whole Foods Market we do it very similar

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,310
to what we do in our supplier world as

00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:07,620
we select products for our store it's

00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:09,150
very important that those partners match

00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,070
our core values and some of our

00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:12,450
principles for those of you who don't

00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:15,930
know Whole Foods Market we're about a

00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:20,190
fourteen billion dollar local retailer

00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:22,740
comprised of 382 stores that are focused

00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:25,440
on community innovation and having a

00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:28,050
local presence and for us when we were

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,520
looking to expand our website and as you

00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:31,890
saw in the video we were pretty much a

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,110
brochure website it was important that

00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:36,270
we were able to capture that local

00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:38,850
experience and have the local content

00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:41,820
for each one of our sort of individual

00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:43,830
micro sites if you will as we look to

00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,180
select a partner we wanted to make sure

00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:47,070
we had something that was flexible

00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,870
something that allowed for innovation

00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:51,540
and we didn't want to be tied to a

00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:53,430
traditional product release schedule and

00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,560
roadmap we wanted to be able to control

00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:57,600
our own destiny destiny and that was

00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,850
really important for us secondly we

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,040
wanted speed to market and being able to

00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:03,900
leverage the portfolio of modules that

00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,960
Drupal had to offer made a very

00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:09,870
compelling case and lastly for us one of

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,510
our core principles and core values of

00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:14,190
our company is community and we're very

00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:15,930
excited to be part of this community

00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,970
where we can be part of giving back and

00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:20,340
part of something that's in for the good

00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:22,350
of all the second thing I wanted to

00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,879
cover is through what we've done and you

00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:26,789
saw in the video we were able

00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:30,419
to pull together and what I would say in

00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:33,659
a very rapid pace compared to a lot of

00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:35,219
other retailers a mobile and a web

00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:37,859
presence that allowed us to

00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:40,829
differentiate experience with both local

00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:42,809
content and experiences that can be

00:29:40,829 --> 00:29:45,299
driven and supported with a global team

00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:47,329
as well as local presence of some of our

00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:49,799
team members that are in our stores

00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:51,389
secondly what we want to do is make sure

00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:53,459
that we were able to have a platform

00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:55,649
that could expand and can connect with

00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:57,809
other aspects of our environment and

00:29:55,649 --> 00:29:59,459
where we plan to go is to connect to

00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:01,349
some of the broader ecosystems that you

00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:04,079
just heard about for us to be able to

00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:05,819
capture some of that customer

00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:07,889
acquisition in places where other

00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:10,349
customers are at but at the same time

00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:11,969
now develop more enriching experiences

00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:13,499
through content and we're very excited

00:30:11,969 --> 00:30:15,629
about where the future is going with

00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:20,779
this and can't wait to hear about more

00:30:15,629 --> 00:30:20,779
awesome thank you Jason thank you

00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:30,450
all right great so prove that you know

00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:32,010
organizations do want to tightly control

00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:35,340
and own that experience and have the

00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:37,710
flexibility to make it their own and so

00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,600
of course I think it's time to sort of

00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:42,030
jump into Drupal eight a little bit you

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,590
know I painted this picture probably

00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:46,190
some of you may be a little nervous

00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:48,150
about what that means for our future but

00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:50,130
let's talk about what it really means

00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:54,809
for Drupal and specifically in the

00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:55,860
context of Drupal 8 all right so I think

00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:57,780
one of the things we've done really

00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:01,290
really well with Drupal 8 if you think

00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:03,000
about this assembled web journey map and

00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:04,980
I put it back in the screen we've

00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,860
actually made each of these little steps

00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,870
better so we've become a lot better in

00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,520
being the assembled web platform and

00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,530
there's a lot of room of growth in just

00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,900
being that because as I mentioned most

00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:17,669
organizations are still stuck in the

00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,470
dynamic web they're still you know

00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:21,419
messing around with the database and SQL

00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:25,110
queries and all of these things are

00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:26,669
writing a lot of code from scratch and

00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:28,620
so let's let's talk a little bit more

00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:29,790
about what exactly we've done one of the

00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,309
things we've done actually is we've

00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:33,750
adopted symphony and you know we've

00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:36,299
talked about that but I wanted to talk

00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:39,720
about it in the context of let's say the

00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:43,080
35 millimeter film right symphony is a

00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:46,130
way for us to standardize if we adopt

00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:48,540
weak imagine if WordPress adopted twig

00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:50,880
all right so now every word press theme

00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,830
ur would automatically be able to build

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,190
triple things and so by leveraging

00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:58,429
something like symphony we actually are

00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:00,840
able to innovate faster we're able to

00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:02,780
you know attract more people to Drupal

00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,830
faster as well and it's not just twig

00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:07,230
there is many other things that we've

00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,730
done that way but it also begs the

00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:11,640
question and I don't have all the

00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:14,460
answers like can we give back more to

00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,020
Symphony right like we've built things

00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,700
like see you mine and I'll talk a little

00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,830
bit about that in a second and there's

00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:23,490
actually not that much Drupal specific

00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:25,740
to what we've done around C of mine or

00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:28,500
you know configuration management is

00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:31,320
there a possibility to put that back in

00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:33,900
Symphony so every other CMS can maybe

00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:36,059
leverage that and is that a way that we

00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:39,290
can grow and increase our adoption

00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:39,290
adoption over

00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:46,590
the other thing we've done is in a

00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:48,720
drupal seven one of our strengths is

00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:51,660
actually our data modeling tools you

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,040
know entity CCK all of these things

00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,800
we've worked on this for many many years

00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:58,470
but it was still wasn't quite perfect it

00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:01,590
still wasn't quite right some of the

00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:03,510
things that we have like blocks there

00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:06,630
weren't entities or you know aggregator

00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:08,640
feeds weren't entities and then if you

00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:10,860
look at nodes like no titles we're in

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,650
proper fields and like the publication

00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,790
date of notes weren't proper fields and

00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:16,680
so one of the things we've done in

00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:19,350
Drupal 8 we've actually made that

00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,670
already great data modeling tool even

00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:23,070
better

00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:25,350
and so now blocks for example are

00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:28,320
entities and every every little field

00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:30,120
you know will be a proper field that is

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,600
what you know that's configurable that

00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:35,100
can be you know added to something all

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:40,230
of these things and on top of that we've

00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:44,070
also added views to core which which

00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:46,680
will make it even more powerful so the

00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:48,300
other thing we've done here is we've

00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,190
added actually more fields than we have

00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,170
in Drupal 7 things like linked fields

00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:55,400
and phone fields and date field some

00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:58,200
email field some entity reference fields

00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,600
in doing so these are actually semantic

00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,910
fields and so we're able to support

00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,650
things like schema.org and you know

00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:06,570
Drupal 8 will be semantic from the

00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:11,100
ground up and we'll talk a little bit

00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:15,300
about that in a second um all right and

00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:18,480
so even you know eat both the entities

00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:20,310
and views we've actually made them

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,380
completely restful from the ground up as

00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:25,800
well so every time you have an entity

00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:28,110
you're able to update it delete it edit

00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,900
it to restful api same thing with views

00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:33,330
like you can quickly config configure of

00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:35,580
view and then i only can you output that

00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:38,370
view as HTML you can also choose to out

00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:43,320
it as output it as json or any other

00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:48,010
formats and so that is quite powerful as

00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:50,149
i'll show you in a few a few minutes

00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:52,550
themeing we've done a lot of work there

00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:55,429
we simplified a lot of the HTML we've

00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:57,920
adopted to ake I mentioned that we added

00:34:55,429 --> 00:35:00,470
responsive theming throughout core and

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,720
we're also making we're also working on

00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:04,280
making themes more secure chick's is

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,130
doing some work on that this week

00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,450
actually which will make it easier to

00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:14,510
share themes or to have other people

00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:17,450
help build your themes configuration you

00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:19,520
know views and rests are basically all

00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:22,430
configurable to us so you don't actually

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,740
have to write code to start using these

00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:26,869
things which again fits into this vision

00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:28,580
of going from the assembled web from the

00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:30,619
dynamic web to the assemble clip and

00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:32,570
really simplifies building great

00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:35,869
experiences and then we've done a ton of

00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:37,960
work on the authoring experience you

00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:40,670
know from in-place editing to

00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:42,890
redesigning the content creation page to

00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:44,780
you know responsive backends so you can

00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:47,740
you know edit things on your from your

00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:50,180
smartphone a lot of work has gone into

00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:52,339
simplifying this experience here as well

00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:54,050
so every little step along the way we've

00:35:52,339 --> 00:35:55,580
made these things better and we've

00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:57,200
simplified the experience

00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:59,599
same thing with deploying code

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:03,800
configuration management we'll make it

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:05,390
easy you know for people to deploy

00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:09,800
Drupal sites and give them greater

00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:11,240
control over that as well so hi this is

00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:15,109
gonna all it up

00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:18,740
well when Drupal 8 once we've released

00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:21,650
your plate you'll be able to like create

00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:24,710
semantic content like in events with a

00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:26,810
name and a date and a location even an

00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:30,099
image and that will map onto entities in

00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:32,660
Drupal you know in different fields

00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:34,880
these are structured in the database and

00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:39,619
you can then create branded experiences

00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:44,810
out of the data you can reuse those data

00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:46,670
elements these entities in views you can

00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:48,260
contextualize them you can translate

00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:51,440
them or you can even you know change

00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:52,910
location because we now have that all in

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,609
a structured format that we can work

00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:57,530
with easily you can also make these

00:36:55,609 --> 00:37:00,290
things discoverable like we can easily

00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:01,819
output these things for you know the

00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:09,019
googles and the Facebook's to

00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:10,969
to pick up and of course thanks to the

00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:12,259
restful api is and the responsive design

00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:14,029
and all of these other things it will

00:37:12,259 --> 00:37:20,140
also be completely multi-channel so it

00:37:14,029 --> 00:37:22,699
will work on any any device and so I

00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:25,130
wanted to you know take a moment and

00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:27,799
actually you know talk about that

00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:29,569
because we kind of forget about that

00:37:27,799 --> 00:37:31,729
sometimes and there's really no other

00:37:29,569 --> 00:37:34,880
system in the world that does this or

00:37:31,729 --> 00:37:36,739
that dust is so effortlessly and I feel

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,630
like we're always criticizing ourselves

00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:41,329
but there's really nothing else and

00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:43,969
people complain about how WordPress is

00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:46,219
easier to use again maybe it's easier to

00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:47,779
use but it doesn't even come close to

00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:48,680
doing these kinds of things it doesn't

00:37:47,779 --> 00:37:50,779
come close

00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,999
it's like miles and miles away from this

00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:55,190
so we shouldn't think it's for granted

00:37:52,999 --> 00:37:59,390
like this is pretty amazing

00:37:55,190 --> 00:38:00,769
that's not available anywhere else not

00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:03,949
just WordPress the same thing with our

00:38:00,769 --> 00:38:06,920
proprietary competitors so this is a

00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:09,829
very big deal for Drupal 8 and so

00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:12,739
effectively what that will allow us to

00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:15,709
do is until loop it back is we can

00:38:12,739 --> 00:38:19,670
actually embrace these big players right

00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:23,739
because what will be really good at with

00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:27,440
Drupal 8 is you know creating this

00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:30,289
semantic markup and content creation and

00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,420
content creation and then we can easily

00:38:30,289 --> 00:38:34,609
output that and let a big player sort of

00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:36,619
visualize it in whatever way they want

00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:38,209
and it actually gets us a little bit

00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:41,660
closer to this notion of a headless

00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:43,969
Drupal where Drupal is sort of a Content

00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,799
repository but where multiple other

00:38:43,969 --> 00:38:49,130
frameworks can interact with that and

00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:51,709
we've made a lot of progress on that all

00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:53,299
the things I talked about but also we've

00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:55,699
been talking a lot about the notion of

00:38:53,299 --> 00:38:57,739
addressable blocks and the improvements

00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:59,539
in a render API will actually start to

00:38:57,739 --> 00:39:01,369
allow us to do these things and

00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:04,099
hopefully we'll be able to integrate

00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:06,739
with frameworks like you know angular GS

00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:08,869
and sort of embrace some of the you know

00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:11,599
new or alternative ways of building

00:39:08,869 --> 00:39:14,960
websites so I feel very very excited

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:17,450
about that at the same time

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,130
we can also focus on building these

00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:21,260
custom branded experiences we can

00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:23,990
actually do both we can play with the

00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:26,030
big guys and make data available to them

00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:29,540
for them to visualize and we can create

00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:31,369
our own experiences as well and the way

00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:34,369
to do so is we don't control all the

00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:36,470
pieces the way Google does but we can

00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:39,500
actually build a bigger platform by

00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:41,000
using integrations with other systems we

00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,550
can do all of these same things and our

00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,900
improvements to the restful api is and

00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:47,200
and all of these other things will

00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:50,119
actually make it easier for us to

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:53,960
integrate with many players and this is

00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:55,220
also not a small deal it's a big deal

00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,130
because none of our proprietary

00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:59,809
competitors can do that I mean they can

00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:02,240
integrate with a few platforms but they

00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:04,609
don't have the flexibility that we have

00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,309
in Drupal to integrate with hundreds or

00:40:04,609 --> 00:40:10,160
thousands of different platforms right

00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:12,200
and if you use a proprietary CMS and

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,839
your integration doesn't exist they're

00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:17,780
toast versus where Drupal you have the

00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:20,089
flexibility you know to actually build

00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:22,400
it there is no limits in what you can do

00:40:20,089 --> 00:40:23,780
so this is a very unique advantage the

00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,450
open source in Drupal and I think

00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:29,329
sometimes you don't realize that right

00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:30,920
and so I don't even know how these other

00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:32,869
players will actually compete in that

00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:35,900
world when they can build these really

00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:39,890
compelling integrations that we need to

00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:41,540
build and so you know very strong unique

00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:43,339
advantage and so it effectively will

00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:45,020
enable you know brands like Whole Foods

00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:47,839
and you know many others hundreds

00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:50,450
thousands of others to build unique

00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:54,740
experiences that aren't just big box

00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:57,200
experiences and I think that's really

00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:59,630
important and so all things considered I

00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,730
really truly believe that Drupal 8 will

00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:03,799
be a game changer like we've done so

00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:06,079
many of the things rights with all the

00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:08,930
right ingredients to get to that next

00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:15,530
level to the fourth wave of the web the

00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:18,140
experience web as Holly mentioned the

00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:20,660
number of people that contributed just

00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:25,180
to core has actually doubled or more

00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:25,180
than doubled since rupal 7 so

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,240
that that is a very impressive number if

00:41:33,109 --> 00:41:36,770
we look at sort of patches committed per

00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,200
day we see that number is up by five

00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:42,590
fifty five percent as well so not only

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,240
more people but also of course you know

00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:45,800
more velocity in terms of patches

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,540
committed and this is just for court and

00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,150
so I wanted to take a minute and ask

00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:52,880
everybody that has a patch in court to

00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:56,350
stand up because I think you guys have

00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,350
done such an amazing job

00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:05,340
thank you

00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:13,059
I've been working on this for over three

00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:16,249
years and you know they can use that

00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:17,719
it's not been easy so of course the big

00:42:16,249 --> 00:42:21,319
question is you know when can I use

00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:22,189
Drupal 8 so I'd like to talk a little

00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:25,789
bit about that right now

00:42:22,189 --> 00:42:34,039
and so today there's only 15 beta

00:42:25,789 --> 00:42:36,439
blockers left so we may actually be at

00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:40,699
14 I don't know but last night we were

00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:45,140
at 15 all right we need to fix one and

00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:52,640
then it's 14 that adds up to me 15 minus

00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:55,429
1 is 14 and so if we get to 0 this week

00:42:52,640 --> 00:43:01,729
I'll buy everybody an ice cream i buy

00:42:55,429 --> 00:43:04,729
that promised we need to get this zero

00:43:01,729 --> 00:43:08,929
by the ends of before you know Friday

00:43:04,729 --> 00:43:10,429
night and so once we get to zero what's

00:43:08,929 --> 00:43:13,400
going to happen is we'll start doing

00:43:10,429 --> 00:43:14,539
beta releases so we'll do beta 1 and you

00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,400
know beta 2 and beta 3

00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:18,169
and what that means is that it's sort of

00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,599
the starting point where we would

00:43:18,169 --> 00:43:24,019
encourage you to start you know porting

00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:27,259
your modules from 7 to 8 right and so

00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:29,390
the API is I know it should be stable

00:43:27,259 --> 00:43:31,819
but we may still change the API is based

00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:33,979
on you know feedback critical bugs but

00:43:31,819 --> 00:43:36,499
you know pretty much we commit to trying

00:43:33,979 --> 00:43:38,390
to keep the API stable it's not ready

00:43:36,499 --> 00:43:40,339
for production yet but it's sort of the

00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:43,400
point where you know contributors should

00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:45,559
start upgrading their modules once we

00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,679
get to zero critical bugs which is

00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:52,400
different from the beta blockers we will

00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:54,589
start doing release candidates and you

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,739
know once we feel good about that we

00:43:54,589 --> 00:44:02,089
will eventually do the you know the

00:43:57,739 --> 00:44:05,479
Drupal 8 release so today we have 99

00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:07,400
critical bugs left to resolve as you can

00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:09,409
see this graph shows sort of the number

00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,209
of outstanding critical bugs over time

00:44:09,409 --> 00:44:13,729
and you can see that we sort of peaked

00:44:11,209 --> 00:44:17,179
in September last year and that ever

00:44:13,729 --> 00:44:18,740
since the number of critical bugs has

00:44:17,179 --> 00:44:21,200
been you know going down

00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,310
today we have 99 critical bugs left

00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,650
which is a good thing because it means

00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:29,330
that the number of you know bugs we fix

00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:31,220
you know on our say weekly basis or

00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:33,530
monthly basis is actually bigger than

00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:35,390
the number of new criticals that are

00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:37,340
being filed because of course we still

00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:38,990
discover new bugs as well

00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:45,800
so the fact that it's going down is

00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:47,300
great it also means that you know if you

00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,190
want to release if you just look at the

00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:52,130
data if you want to release Drupal 8

00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:55,550
this year we somehow need to increase

00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:57,020
our efficiency by a factor of three and

00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:59,480
so we can do that in multiple ways we

00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:02,000
can you know get more people involved to

00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:05,420
help work on these critical bugs and I

00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,760
think we should - many companies frankly

00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:09,770
that use Drupal they don't give back to

00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,050
Drupal and I think it's a great

00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:15,020
opportunity for these kinds of companies

00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:17,570
to get involved here I think we should

00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:19,100
also be smarter about what we treat as

00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:22,490
critical bugs and we should think about

00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:25,640
is this really critical or you know can

00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:31,070
this be fixed in 8.1 and that way we can

00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:33,890
also increase our efficiency alright so

00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:36,140
and we know be working that pretty hard

00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:38,660
and we've made you know big improvements

00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:42,140
lately in the way we we deal with these

00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:44,150
critical issues so once we get to zero

00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:47,840
critical issues we'll basically to a

00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:51,619
party and release Drupal 8 I don't know

00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:55,070
exactly when that will be but I'm

00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:58,550
guessing that it may be early or middle

00:45:55,070 --> 00:46:00,230
of next year alright and that's not

00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:02,900
everything we've decided to introduce

00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:05,930
continuous integration and so even after

00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:07,900
the release of 8.0 we're now going to be

00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:10,100
able to add new things to Drupal core

00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:13,190
this is something which we haven't done

00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:14,660
in the past and so for example in 8.1 we

00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:17,960
could maybe choose to that migrate

00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:21,250
module to core or in 8.2 we could say at

00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:23,780
media functionality or in our layouts

00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:24,980
functionality and so forth so this will

00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:28,250
allow for a more continuous integration

00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:30,140
and allows us to you know keep Drupal

00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:31,910
relevant that way and the way we'll do

00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:34,430
that is in a way that doesn't

00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:36,170
break backwards-compatibility we'll try

00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:38,839
not to break backwards-compatibility but

00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:45,140
we can add ap ice and we'll manage that

00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:48,410
process that way alright and so you know

00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:50,930
to wrap up the keynote I think this is a

00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:53,359
really exciting time as I mentioned

00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:54,680
there's all of these new innovations you

00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,539
know many of which I mentioned that

00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:59,000
there's many more and they're all coming

00:46:56,539 --> 00:47:01,430
together we're at the early stages of

00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,789
that like they're not readily available

00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:07,400
for everyone yet and it gives us an

00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:09,589
opportunity to to rethink what the

00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:11,420
experience of many things online should

00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:13,880
be and how Drupal can help accomplish

00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:17,420
that because as we've shown with the

00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:20,059
camera it's all about the experience and

00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,710
simplifying the experience over time and

00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:23,930
as I mentioned under the hood things may

00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:25,970
get more complex but ultimately we need

00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:28,460
to think about the experience for the

00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:30,799
end user and the end user being the

00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:32,240
visitors of the website not the site

00:47:30,799 --> 00:47:34,280
builders and I think that's a big shift

00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,619
that we'll have to make we need to

00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:38,480
continue to improve the developer

00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:39,470
experience but we also need to start

00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:44,089
thinking about how to improve

00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:47,809
drastically improve the arm you know the

00:47:44,089 --> 00:47:50,150
end user experience and that will allow

00:47:47,809 --> 00:47:53,000
us to build these great experiences and

00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:54,349
work with the big players and I feel you

00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,940
know really really good frankly about

00:47:54,349 --> 00:47:58,160
where we're at with that with Drupal I

00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:59,750
think more than any other CMS I think

00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,109
we've sort of navigated us to the right

00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:06,849
place you know at the right time and so

00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:06,849
with that I'd like to thank you

00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:14,500
you

00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:19,920
I believe there may be some questions we

00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:23,070
have a few questions for you drink thank

00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,840
you very much thank you alright so we

00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:27,060
had a lot of great questions come in all

00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:29,700
right so we're going to get to as many

00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:31,200
as we can we kind of just answered this

00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:33,690
first question and one of your last

00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:36,570
slides indie drummer from Butler

00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:38,850
University just we did Butler

00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:41,550
University's new to all this if we're

00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:45,090
starting a complete overhaul of our ddu

00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:47,580
site now Drupal 7 or 11 now Drupal 7

00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:50,550
right now yes okay it's the answer for

00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:53,340
you know 99% of the cases unless you

00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:55,140
know um and I think if you have core

00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:56,640
developers on staff people that really

00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:59,550
know Drupal 8 inside out and that are

00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,080
willing to what we call chase head if

00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:03,300
you're okay with you know API is a

00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:05,760
change and data data models that change

00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:07,950
and you're capable of sort of you know

00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,900
migrating your your site from one

00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:12,570
unstable version two and another

00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:14,730
unstable version without a provided

00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:18,540
upgrade pad then you know you're welcome

00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:19,580
to this is our data but that's really

00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:24,450
what we're at today

00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:27,240
alright so god forbid you get hit by a

00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:31,500
bus or a malfunctioning camera drone

00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:33,990
flying around what happens to Drupal

00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:37,800
leadership I mean right now you're in a

00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:42,930
unique position right that um it's a

00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:45,570
good question and I'll say that in the

00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:49,530
past it was actually worse and by that I

00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:51,810
mean that over the last years I've

00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:54,450
actually put many steps in place to sort

00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:56,610
of remove myself from me you know the

00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:58,410
bottleneck and all the way from you know

00:49:56,610 --> 00:50:00,120
go finding the Drupal Association which

00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:03,390
took over managing the server and

00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:05,310
organizing the conference from me to

00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:07,200
more recently putting in place a

00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:09,150
governance model with different

00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,980
committees you know the drupal the doric

00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:12,930
software working group and the security

00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:15,090
team we formalized that and you know we

00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:17,040
started a technical working group and

00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:20,370
each of these groups or committees have

00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,990
you know like leaders you know that are

00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:24,780
officially appointed and so that's

00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:26,190
another way for me to sort of make sure

00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,840
we have a governance structure in place

00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:30,210
that being said all that there's

00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:32,910
probably more I should do and can do and

00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:34,170
so I think I don't have the answers

00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:36,510
today but I think that's something that

00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:38,670
I'll continue to work on okay I

00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:40,410
definitely want to make sure that if

00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:42,450
something were to happen group was in

00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:44,010
good shape and and to be honest I feel

00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:45,660
pretty good about that I feel like we

00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:47,220
have a lot of strong leaders in the

00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:50,820
community today I think the question was

00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:52,860
more or less about the governance

00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:56,490
structure and the organization around it

00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:58,740
but your role as someone who you know

00:50:56,490 --> 00:51:00,720
basically chooses the next core

00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:03,150
committers and helps push things along

00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,590
and people come to you to make the big

00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:06,270
decision when a decision has to be made

00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:09,210
right well I think we have many strong

00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:10,950
people that do a lot of that today you

00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:13,470
know people like you know catch an alux

00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:15,960
buff I'm Angie like you know just just

00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:18,750
relative to core they're making a lot of

00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:20,430
big decisions along the way and again I

00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:22,140
think there's more we can do it and I'll

00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:23,730
think about what else we can do Adam I

00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,660
don't really have that energy I don't

00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:26,220
think you've anything to worry about I

00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,020
think a few people will jump in front of

00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:30,870
you if the drones are tending your way I

00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:34,410
think we're we're good there

00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:37,950
JCL 3:24 asks how do we not leave behind

00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:40,820
the freelancer or small shops as Drupal

00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:43,620
continues to grow in the enterprise um

00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:45,390
that's a good question actually feel

00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:48,930
like a lot of the things that I talked

00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:51,450
about from the improvements to our data

00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:54,600
modeling tools to describe it abstractly

00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:56,670
ccq know entities and views as well as

00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:59,580
to all of the authoring experience

00:51:56,670 --> 00:52:01,740
improvements you know better usability

00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:04,260
there actually are great improvements

00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:08,520
for both small and large organization so

00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:12,150
I don't necessarily feel like we're

00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:13,980
leaving them behind you know that way

00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:15,810
like if I feel like we're actually doing

00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:18,780
a lot of things which benefit both of

00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:20,370
them and that is in line with where we

00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:22,740
need to go as a project to stay relevant

00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:24,090
so I think it might be one of those

00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:26,790
things where people to community feel

00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:29,190
that the to be a developer Drupal

00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:30,660
developers being more complex it is it

00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:32,250
could become it could fall further

00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:34,740
behind that way but what you're saying

00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:38,940
is that improvements were making to

00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:41,460
Drupal 8 make it so that more small

00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:44,160
shops or more hobbyists can get involved

00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:46,560
without having to know more code well

00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,640
it's a very complex topic because you

00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:50,100
know one of the things I mentioned in my

00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:52,020
keynote is as we evolve the complexity

00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,820
under the hood becomes more complex just

00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:56,640
like with the cameras and so that's

00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:58,260
reality and so then the question is how

00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,470
do we best manage that and I think us

00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:03,150
adopting object-oriented

00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:04,740
you know programming techniques and

00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:07,110
Symphony which brings a level of

00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:09,450
standardization and we use is actually

00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:11,100
the best way to do it even though it's

00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:14,250
still becoming you know a little bit

00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:15,870
more complex for some so I think yeah I

00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:18,420
think we're doing what we need to do it

00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:20,900
and I feel good about them okay I think

00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:23,340
you made a trip to Asia last year for a

00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:27,990
couple years in couple years ago well we

00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:29,010
have a question from about HP nad IG so

00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:32,100
I'm not sure how to pronounce that

00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:34,710
but now how do you see Drupal in South

00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:36,570
South Asia or India during the next few

00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:38,550
years you know what's the priority or

00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:40,320
what is of priority yeah so I've been to

00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:43,290
India a couple years ago and I was

00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:46,050
amazed like what you know was there for

00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:48,690
10 days or something and I organized you

00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:50,850
know or at then that's a Drupal camp in

00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:53,100
a different city in India every other

00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:56,300
day and so is organized by the local

00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:58,950
community so I went to you know Mumbai

00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:01,380
Hyderabad you know a couple of other big

00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:04,110
cities and not every one of these events

00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:06,210
like hundreds of people showed up unlike

00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:08,400
in some some cases you know five six

00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:10,620
hundred people showed up and so it's

00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,410
it's impressive to see how much Drupal

00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:15,330
there actually is in India and also how

00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:18,120
advanced they are so I think they get a

00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:20,430
lot of negative credit see often time

00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:22,350
from you know from our part of the world

00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:24,990
so to speak but I think they're actually

00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:26,100
doing really really well and I you know

00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:29,400
there's been a lot of growth and

00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:31,110
adoption there of Drupal as well same

00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,060
thing I've been to Australia a couple of

00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:36,600
times like I mean obviously a big

00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:37,800
difference with India but you know very

00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,690
impressed with the level of maturity

00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,270
there as well I've never been to China

00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:43,100
or Japan

00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:46,250
so I'm planning a trip this year in

00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:48,500
September to to sort of go to China and

00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:50,510
take temperature of the state of Drupal

00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:52,369
in China because I honestly don't know

00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:54,200
much about how things are going there so

00:54:52,369 --> 00:54:56,869
I think it's important for us that we

00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:59,420
try to be inclusive and that we think of

00:54:56,869 --> 00:55:02,270
Drupal as a global community and a

00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:04,130
global project and now we can get these

00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:07,580
you know all these all these people

00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:09,619
involved alright so you mentioned again

00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:11,090
this topic towards the end you wrote a

00:55:09,619 --> 00:55:13,640
blog post a couple of weeks ago about

00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:15,830
employing more the community

00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:19,190
organizations employing more Drupal core

00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:22,369
contributors right what more can we do

00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:24,020
to help that process along yeah so I

00:55:22,369 --> 00:55:28,100
think one of the biggest things I think

00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:30,890
we can do so the way things work in my

00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:34,670
mind and it's a simplification is large

00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:37,190
organizations you know like Whole Foods

00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:41,270
or you know you know I met with you know

00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:43,369
companies like like Pfizer and they're

00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:46,100
literally spending millions of dollars

00:55:43,369 --> 00:55:48,619
on Drupal and so what happens is they

00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:51,770
spend that money on Drupal shops and

00:55:48,619 --> 00:55:54,140
those Drupal shops hire people actually

00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:56,300
you know Drupal developers and they're

00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:58,730
contributing and so we should recognize

00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:01,600
that that is how the world works a

00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:04,640
little bit and we should provide credits

00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:06,520
to these organizations that actually do

00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:09,350
give back because in oftentimes

00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:11,810
organizations don't write you know have

00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:14,300
developers that give back to Drupal and

00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:16,880
so I think we do an excellent job at

00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:19,460
giving individual developers credit I

00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,890
think if we were to give organizations

00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:24,080
credit for having developers that can

00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:26,930
contribute back to Drupal whether it's

00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:29,840
Drupal shops or sort of end users like

00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:31,910
Whole Foods I think that would really

00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:33,680
stimulate these organizations to give

00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:35,960
back more like it provides a real

00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:38,420
incentive like the visibility that they

00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:41,510
get from giving back it's really

00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:43,490
valuable to them and encouraging so I

00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:46,369
actually have some thoughts which I'll

00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:48,020
which I'll write up and post today or

00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:50,390
tomorrow and post it on my blog about

00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:51,350
how we can actually implement that on

00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:52,940
drupal.org

00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:55,130
we can do it right now because I think

00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:58,880
since your blog post

00:56:55,130 --> 00:57:00,499
chapter 3 is hired out they did and Eric

00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,019
mentioned earlier that you know black

00:57:00,499 --> 00:57:05,029
mesh hired Kathy so I say no and the

00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:07,189
more we can see of that exactly that's

00:57:05,029 --> 00:57:10,789
fantastic and so my blog post I suggest

00:57:07,189 --> 00:57:13,489
that that you need to understand the

00:57:10,789 --> 00:57:16,189
impact of hiring people and so for

00:57:13,489 --> 00:57:18,679
example you know in the case of my

00:57:16,189 --> 00:57:21,170
company Akio the core developers they

00:57:18,679 --> 00:57:22,789
also are involved with webinars and so

00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:25,549
we've actually started tracking how much

00:57:22,789 --> 00:57:27,109
revenue comes back from their use of

00:57:25,549 --> 00:57:29,089
these webinars and that allows us to

00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:30,699
make business cases like you know if you

00:57:29,089 --> 00:57:32,900
can demonstrate that there is real

00:57:30,699 --> 00:57:36,259
financial value in having core

00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:39,469
developers and staff and I think a lot

00:57:36,259 --> 00:57:41,299
more organizations will be eager to hire

00:57:39,469 --> 00:57:43,400
core developers and I think that will

00:57:41,299 --> 00:57:46,489
help us sustain Drupal development and

00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:48,650
increase in our velocity so it sounds

00:57:46,489 --> 00:57:51,170
like you're talking about it's less

00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:53,299
about just the feel-good aspect of doing

00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:54,319
it but we need to move towards being

00:57:53,299 --> 00:57:57,709
able to quantity

00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:59,599
yes provide your numbers and or is there

00:57:57,709 --> 00:58:00,979
no return on investment exactly and I

00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:02,299
gave some numbers in my blog post I

00:58:00,979 --> 00:58:04,239
don't know them at the top of my head

00:58:02,299 --> 00:58:06,650
but it encouraged you to have a look

00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:08,089
alright just a couple more questions and

00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:10,789
I'll have the drones take off and take

00:58:08,089 --> 00:58:12,109
the pictures here um what surprised you

00:58:10,789 --> 00:58:16,640
most about the Drupal 8 development

00:58:12,109 --> 00:58:23,029
process oh good question

00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:24,949
but sue so I was actually so I should

00:58:23,029 --> 00:58:27,619
have learned this many times already but

00:58:24,949 --> 00:58:31,130
I was actually surprised by how

00:58:27,619 --> 00:58:33,859
difficult it can be to cope with a lot

00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:36,739
of change and that it actually takes a

00:58:33,859 --> 00:58:38,839
lot of efforts to help people move along

00:58:36,739 --> 00:58:42,319
and learn and you know because Drupal 8

00:58:38,839 --> 00:58:44,959
brings a lot of changes and I guess I

00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:47,989
sort of naively assumed that people

00:58:44,959 --> 00:58:49,219
would understand that easier you know

00:58:47,989 --> 00:58:52,759
what I mean with it so like once there

00:58:49,219 --> 00:58:54,650
was a decision more people get on board

00:58:52,759 --> 00:58:56,569
quicker right that is what you

00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:58,519
originally thought yes okay and so

00:58:56,569 --> 00:59:00,079
laughing that we all have to learn over

00:58:58,519 --> 00:59:02,390
and over and over and I think making

00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:04,069
change in a community the size of Drupal

00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:06,650
is really hard like we need to retrain

00:59:04,069 --> 00:59:08,240
hundreds of thousands of developers

00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:10,599
from you know to go from seven to eight

00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:13,609
and that is a massive undertaking

00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:15,140
absolutely I will do three last quick

00:59:13,609 --> 00:59:17,240
questions um

00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:20,210
Byron Sims asked what kind of barbecue

00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:23,329
do you like actually left exit in a

00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:25,220
Texas barbecue with slow cooking or oh I

00:59:23,329 --> 00:59:27,559
don't know how it works but with the big

00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:30,049
thing with the heat the steam coming too

00:59:27,559 --> 00:59:33,619
I'm just an all barbecue I don't know I

00:59:30,049 --> 00:59:35,390
love all barbecue like okay this might

00:59:33,619 --> 00:59:36,799
be my favorite question because I'm just

00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:39,920
I'm kind of upset that I didn't think

00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:42,259
about it is so andreas W back off Driss

00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,940
I'm an organizer for Drupal Camp PA in

00:59:42,259 --> 00:59:46,089
Pittsburgh will you be the keynote

00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:46,089
speaker

00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:51,529
happy to talk about that I need to look

00:59:50,269 --> 00:59:53,329
at my Kellner I don't know well just

00:59:51,529 --> 00:59:55,490
very good nor doing well I told them I

00:59:53,329 --> 00:59:57,200
bet so you know I like my job I like

00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:59,690
attending these events and I try to do

00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,609
you know to do a good amount of them he

00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:02,990
chairs alright alright the last question

01:00:01,609 --> 01:00:05,779
we had a lot of comments during your

01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:07,460
talk mainly about privacy when you're

01:00:05,779 --> 01:00:10,519
showing the Google slides up there a lot

01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:12,980
of nervous people but I think most

01:00:10,519 --> 01:00:14,930
importantly and the most tweets we got

01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:22,779
that wasn't about your shopping history

01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:27,349
and what exactly is a vacuum beard funny

01:00:22,779 --> 01:00:30,079
it's uh it's actually quite cool it's a

01:00:27,349 --> 01:00:31,789
beard trimmer and it has a vacuum in it

01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:34,700
and so it actually sucks in all the

01:00:31,789 --> 01:00:36,710
hairs and then instead of all the hair

01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:39,259
going all over to sink in the bathroom

01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:41,059
it's like contains basically in your

01:00:39,259 --> 01:00:43,009
trimmer I'm picturing you doing this on

01:00:41,059 --> 01:00:46,999
a clock on the way to work

01:00:43,009 --> 01:00:50,109
no I don't shave in the car overall

01:00:46,999 --> 01:00:50,109
