alrighty so I'm here to introduce Erin

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,790
Peterson so Erin is the SVP of strategic

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,530
mobile development at time inc she's

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,719
also the executive director of outer

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,130
curve an OSS foundation focused on

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,410
developing open-source projects between

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,020
enterprise software companies she's a

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,550
founder at station 82 which is dedicated

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,619
to providing technology access to rural

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,570
kids she's on the board of girl develop

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,609
it which aims to teach adult

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,340
particularly women technical development

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,560
skills she was formerly the SVP of paid

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,530
services engineering at AOL and before

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,940
that she worked at Microsoft and Amazon

00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,620
she combines product management and

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,930
technical management skills spend time

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,730
teaching a girl develop it and she's a

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,649
strong proponent of getting more people

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,440
in attack in engineering roles so with

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,440
that I'm thrilled to announce Erin

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,440
welcome

00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:02,309
hopefully I'm miked excellent thank you

00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:05,040
as somebody who runs engineering teams

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:07,619
one of the things that I spend most of

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,530
my time thinking about is the people on

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,990
my engineering teams I think about how

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,810
well they're doing I think about how I

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,430
can help them be more productive I think

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,710
about where I'm going to find more of

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,290
those people where I'm going to find the

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,360
most productive possible people and then

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,300
how I'm going to make them as productive

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,600
as I possibly can once I secure them for

00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,729
my teens when I was first asked to speak

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,789
a Drupal coming I wasn't yet working at

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:38,880
time and I was finishing up a sabbatical

00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:41,190
and the reason I took that sabbatical is

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,340
that when I was running my engineering

00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:46,619
teams at AOL I realized that I have

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,619
enough time left in my career that is

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,080
worth taking some time out and trying to

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:55,050
solve the pipeline problem trying to

00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,489
solve the sheer number of people that I

00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:00,000
have access to you from a hiring

00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:02,459
perspective and i took my ear off and I

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,160
focus on girl develop it in station 82

00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:07,050
and with girl develop it I try to

00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,239
increase the number of adults of

00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:12,090
particularly women that I could hire in

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,459
an engineering rose and with station 82

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,709
I try to find a way to solve the

00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:19,200
pipeline problem of getting rural

00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:21,319
teenagers interested in technology and

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,000
getting them to go into technology

00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,550
projects and programs when they got to

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,069
college so a lot of what I'm talking

00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,860
about today is based on that time out

00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:34,379
that I took now that I'm back in

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:38,030
commercial space I'm hoping to reap some

00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:41,250
of the benefits of what I've learned

00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:44,340
yesterday when we were seeing looking

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,650
trees he asked a question which was what

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,650
do we do now that Drupal is becoming

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,930
increasingly large competitive with big

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,910
projects big commercial projects big

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,099
commercial partners and the first thing

00:02:53,910 --> 00:03:00,329
I thought was you engage in asymmetrical

00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:02,099
warfare because if you're a member of a

00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:04,450
diversity group and you've spent your

00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:06,099
entire career being some

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,800
it's different than most of the people

00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:11,349
around you you learn how to make that

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,550
difference work for you and so when

00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:14,620
you're looking at somebody else trying

00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,360
to solve a similar problem how do you

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,250
compete against these large well-funded

00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,260
incumbents who mostly look like one

00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,700
another when you are an open source

00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,090
project and you look very very different

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:28,660
you find ways to make those differences

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:31,209
work to your advantage and this has some

00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,459
classic examples throughout history so

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:35,890
one of the ones that is very popular 2.2

00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:37,870
is the Revolutionary War where you had

00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,959
all these British redcoats who were just

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:43,989
like one another and add successfully

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,000
one war after war after war by marching

00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:48,220
in the battle in these perfect lines and

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,890
then you had these American insurgents

00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,380
who are not at all like those British

00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,930
armies they weren't well-funded they

00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:58,030
didn't have good uniforms most of them

00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,370
frankly didn't even want to be there but

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,440
they had to win and they ran out in the

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,150
woods they developed a completely

00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,190
different way of engaging a warfare

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,959
based on the characteristics they had as

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,489
a community and they just started

00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,069
picking off those redcoats in the woods

00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:15,430
and they won and that's sort of the

00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:17,070
classic example of how you compete when

00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,660
you're up against a well-funded

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:24,340
well-organized incumbent and you're the

00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:26,889
insurgent player so there are a lot of

00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,080
models for productive systems but one of

00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:31,240
the ones that I like to look at is for

00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,510
us I like to look at a lot of the ones

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,940
that arise in evolutionary biology and

00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,669
you can look across the sciences but

00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,200
today I'm going to be looking at for us

00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:43,810
and for us as a model for productive

00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,450
systems seashores or another good one

00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,700
tide pools anything where there's a lot

00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,340
of diversity and a lot of change tends

00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,300
to be a relatively healthy system

00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,919
interesting things come out of these

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:59,310
systems raves lot of diversity

00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:03,849
interesting things come out of race

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:06,430
drupal really interesting system a lot

00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:09,729
of diversity a lot of interesting stuff

00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,650
comes out of triple and in fact one of

00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:13,870
the reasons that i'm betting on drupal

00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:16,120
over the long term is the sheer amount

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,639
of diversity in the community

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,190
and the ease with which the Drupal

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,930
community relatively manages those

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:27,910
distinct voices within its community

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:31,449
examples of systems that are not

00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:34,389
particularly productive desert places

00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:38,229
where we've been hit by drought business

00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:39,669
class and your average aircraft I love

00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:41,110
this picture every time I see it it

00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:43,270
makes me laugh and every time I get on

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,520
an airplane and they look at all those

00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,080
guys in the first six rows it just

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,090
completely cracks me up because it's

00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,710
invisible to a lot of people but if

00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:54,130
you're looking for it you see it every

00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:56,949
single time another open source

00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:59,470
conference not to be identified which

00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:01,690
doesn't display the characteristics of

00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:06,880
diverse representation that's found in

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:09,610
the Drupal community blackberry classic

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,400
example of a place that did not mean

00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,770
pain healthy constituency in its

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:19,539
community and the suffering and death as

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:22,830
a result an open source project is as

00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:25,840
healthy and vibrant as its community

00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:28,930
when I'm looking to build healthy open

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,660
source projects and I'm now having been

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,970
running outer curve invested in 20

00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,010
some-odd of these projects one of the

00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,900
things that I look for is how do we

00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:40,479
increase the viability of that community

00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,729
how do we make it easy for people to

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,130
make contributions how do we make the

00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:47,199
documentation relatively easily

00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,660
available how do we make people

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,400
comfortable joining so sort of all the

00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:54,010
hallmarks and I think most people in

00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,620
this room have at the very least a gut

00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:59,020
level if not a data-driven understanding

00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,780
of what it takes to build a healthy open

00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:04,030
source community and so how do you

00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:07,330
attract more participants to your

00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:09,190
community so we know from looking at

00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:12,340
things going back to our forest example

00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:14,620
that within forestry it's increasingly

00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,940
understood that within forestry of all

00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,250
of your trees are exactly the same

00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:21,250
you're not going to be particularly

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:25,330
productive over the very long cycles in

00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:28,330
which foresters work you want something

00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,129
that looks a lot more diverse than what

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,330
they initially

00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:34,559
they were going for when they're

00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:36,689
planting is for us and if you're for

00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:39,719
sure you also know that simply providing

00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:43,589
the conditions sunlight air water isn't

00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:46,259
enough you have to actively engage and

00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:48,360
making sure that you've got a diverse

00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:52,529
representation of species within your

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:55,619
ecosystem you're planting you're growing

00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:58,259
and you're doing this not because you

00:07:55,619 --> 00:08:01,589
love trees so this is not a tree hugger

00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:03,599
left-wing type thing when I think about

00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:06,899
diversity it's not because I'm

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:09,330
particularly huggy because I'm not when

00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:10,860
I think about diversity I think about it

00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:13,769
from the perspective of somebody who's

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,860
competing day in and day out with other

00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:18,899
big companies other incumbents will also

00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,089
have large well-funded engineering teams

00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:23,610
and i'm looking for a competitive

00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:26,939
advantage in the marketplace and that's

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:29,009
exactly what foresters are doing so to

00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:30,659
speak i know i might have pushed this

00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:35,009
too far so we're going to move off the

00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:37,949
forestry example here there are some

00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:39,719
very good other indicators that other

00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:42,389
people who are operating the same

00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,730
competitive space i am are looking at

00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:47,579
diversity from the same perspective that

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:50,160
i am you've got warren buffett who's

00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:52,620
pointing out that as an american economy

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,139
we cannot be competitive worldwide

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,689
unless we address the issue of the

00:08:55,139 --> 00:09:00,060
overall percentage of diversity within

00:08:57,689 --> 00:09:02,910
our large-scale commercial projects

00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:05,370
particularly technology and in this case

00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,139
he's specifically speaking to diversity

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:11,610
is represented by the number of women in

00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:14,880
a community Bezos famously against

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:17,310
social cohesion at amazon this can show

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,709
itself up as a particularly rancorous

00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:23,970
place to work with high attrition rates

00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:26,399
but they build great stuff and if what

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,199
you want to do is build great stuff it

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,410
turns out what you want to do to do that

00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:33,810
is build a community of people who are

00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,870
building your stuff who are willing to

00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:39,660
articulate different points of view

00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:40,350
argue vociferously about their point of

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,700
view

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,940
and then when you come to a conclusion

00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,760
act in concert with the dist with the

00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:52,350
path you all decided to take some very

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,090
effective for Amazon and Google so this

00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,370
is some data that Google released this

00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:58,410
week and I found the response to be

00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,270
fascinating because when I saw these

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:05,400
numbers the first thing I thought was

00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:08,040
wow that's really good that was not the

00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:11,640
popular reaction to their releasing this

00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:14,240
data to me that that showed a lack of

00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,680
familiarity with what the day-to-day

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,870
environment looks like for your average

00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,330
engineering team and I think it's

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,580
amazing that they publish this data I

00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:26,160
think it's amazing that they've taken a

00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,410
public stance and wanting to shift this

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,480
and if somebody who's competing against

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:33,180
them for talent I think is brilliant

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,000
because what they've just publicly done

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,320
is said we welcome diversity and that's

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,960
going to give them an edge and

00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,200
recruiting against me unless I make it

00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:48,090
clear that our teams at I'm also welcome

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,980
diversity now why is this why does

00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,890
Buffett believe that why does Bezos

00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,930
believe that why do I believe that

00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:57,180
that's because there's hard data that

00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,700
suggests that diversity and a team leads

00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,920
to better performance here's a couple

00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,170
pieces of data and by the way at the end

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,180
of my deck I've included all of my

00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:09,120
sources for anybody who wants to pull

00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:12,960
this data up and look at it companies

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:16,410
that have more diversity perform better

00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:19,740
in almost every measure stock market

00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:21,900
performance commercial performance firms

00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,300
that receive the Department of Labor

00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:27,690
award for implementing voluntary

00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:31,410
voluntary formative action programs had

00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:34,410
a stock price jump within 10 days women

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:37,140
on boards are consistent indicator of

00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:42,720
high performance of a company overall

00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:44,760
and this is due to a phenomenon that has

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,250
a lot of data behind it and it's well

00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,920
understood which is that the collective

00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,220
accuracy of a group is equal to the

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,040
average accuracy

00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:57,970
a of any given member plus the overall

00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:00,129
level of diversity so yesterday when

00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:03,189
we're talking about how the Drupal

00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:06,009
community is growing why it's growing

00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:08,709
and what has to be done to keep this a

00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:11,589
healthy growing community one of the

00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:13,990
things I immediately thought was we have

00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:17,230
to protect the level of diversity that's

00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:20,350
in the community today if we're able to

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:22,259
do that we have today as a Drupal

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:25,029
community a competitive advantage

00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:27,430
relative to most of the big commercial

00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:30,370
engineering teams and this is an

00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:32,980
advantage that as a community we want to

00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:37,389
protect to continue to be competitive in

00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:38,829
the marketplace let's talk a little bit

00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:43,029
about the performance of diverse teams

00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:44,649
vs homogenous teams if you've got we can

00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:47,680
probably all read these bullet points if

00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:50,050
you've got diverse points of view among

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,610
people a similar skill composition the

00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,399
diverse points of view are going to win

00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,589
if the agents across the two groups have

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,259
equal ability functionally diverse

00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:01,089
groups outperform homogeneously

00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:05,019
functional groups does that make sense

00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:08,019
for folks functionally diverse groups

00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:10,269
outperform the best individual agents

00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:12,759
which sort of blows out of the water the

00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:16,420
one smart maverick theory that's popular

00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:18,490
with in software engineering and last a

00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:22,149
functionally diverse group whose members

00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:24,610
have less ability I'll perform a group

00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:27,490
of people with high ability who are

00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:31,059
homogeneous also something for this

00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:33,399
community to be thinking about there are

00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:37,209
problems associated with this diversity

00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:39,399
however as an initial pool of problem

00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:41,199
solvers becomes larger functional

00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:43,600
diversity of the group of the best

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:46,120
performing individuals goes down that's

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,829
something the Drupal community is going

00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,959
to be grappling with you're getting a

00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:52,420
larger pool of people you can get more

00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:54,519
productivity but the number of pure

00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:58,059
individual stars is going to be

00:13:54,519 --> 00:14:01,000
proportionately lower however that gain

00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:03,580
and individual abilities is more than

00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,170
offset by the functional diversity of

00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:09,010
the group growing larger in and of

00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:11,710
itself so as a community we are going to

00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:14,470
gain with this functional and social

00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:16,510
diversity but the thing that's really

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:20,110
tricky and this is where most

00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:22,330
communities breakdown is that diversity

00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,850
across the team makes it harder for

00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:26,800
people to communicate it makes it harder

00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,630
for people to collaborate and it makes

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,510
it harder for people to work together if

00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:33,790
you want to be successful you have to

00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,800
find ways to actively make those things

00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,720
occur you have to make it easy for

00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,060
people to communicate you have to make

00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,770
it easy for people to cooperate and you

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:44,860
have to make it easy for people to work

00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:47,400
together this is a guy named Ronald

00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,300
Coase one of my favorite economists

00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,810
everybody should have a favorite

00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:55,690
economist really so what I love about

00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:59,230
him is he did a lot of groundbreaking

00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:03,060
work one a lot of prizes about the rise

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:06,160
of corporations and why corporations are

00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:08,770
economically advantaged relative to a

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,400
similar group of non-affiliated people

00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:15,640
with similar skill sets and what he

00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,250
found is that the transaction costs

00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,140
associated with contributing and

00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:23,110
bringing a product to market were lower

00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,580
if you were part of a company then if a

00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:26,710
bunch of people randomly got together

00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:29,760
and try to get a product into the

00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:32,290
marketplace up until that point

00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:35,020
traditional theory suggested that an

00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:37,210
efficient market and assembly of people

00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,800
with varying skills should be able to

00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:41,470
because they're competing on a per

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:45,570
person basis of cost be able to more

00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:49,650
cheaply bring something to market and

00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:52,090
his theory of why companies grew is

00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:54,720
particularly interesting when you think

00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:57,730
about software and software teens

00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,570
because up until very recently within

00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:03,400
say the last 10 years hands down if you

00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:06,100
wanted to build something really big an

00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:08,050
operating system for example and bring

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,440
it to market you are going to join the

00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:13,540
company to do that the rise of open

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,499
source again as an engineering practice

00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:19,109
haw responded with an increase in

00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:22,799
communication channels email social

00:16:19,109 --> 00:16:24,509
media now github that themselves lowered

00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,899
the transaction costs of people

00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:29,189
collaborating to bring things to market

00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:32,429
open source becomes a very attractive

00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:34,079
economic vehicle for delivering stuff so

00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:37,039
then the question is if production can

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,329
be carried out without any organization

00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:43,049
under what conditions would you want to

00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:46,049
invest in a corporation so there's still

00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:47,789
some latent competition taking place and

00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:49,949
one of the arguments I would make today

00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:52,109
is that one of the areas in which

00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:54,329
corporations have a competitive

00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:57,029
advantage relative to a lot of open

00:16:54,329 --> 00:17:00,569
source communities is they have the

00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:02,939
desire and the wherewithal to coordinate

00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:06,360
that communication across his employees

00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:08,039
and so going back to we just talked

00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:11,009
about a little bit ago with the data if

00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:13,799
those corporations are able to develop

00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:16,769
diverse groups of employees within those

00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:19,319
corporations and also lower the cost of

00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:21,539
communicating it is likely that they're

00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:24,539
going to be able to outflank another

00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:26,039
community that is as diverse and not as

00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:30,389
adept at facilitating communication

00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:32,909
amongst its members and that's where you

00:17:30,389 --> 00:17:36,570
start to get really interesting analysis

00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:39,179
of free and open source vs. commercial

00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:41,460
development what we really want to do

00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:44,369
within an open source community to be

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,440
competitive is have that diversity have

00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:48,509
more diversity than the company's we're

00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,879
competing against and have better

00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:52,200
communication practices established

00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:58,279
where this promotion or those

00:17:52,200 --> 00:18:00,229
communities so

00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:02,719
I'm about to use the presence of women

00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:05,389
in engineering as a proxy for diversity

00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:07,009
overall and I realize I can get all

00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:09,559
sorts of trolling about this time

00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:15,799
acknowledging up front that I'm simply

00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:19,639
using the index of women as a proxy this

00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:22,119
shows us the percentage of women in the

00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:26,059
general population and the workforce

00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:28,969
those who subscribe to open source

00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:31,549
mailing lists all the way down to the

00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:33,259
percentage they make contributions and I

00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:35,539
want to look for this data because many

00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:37,580
many people reference the fact that 2.5%

00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:39,139
of contributions and open source come

00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:41,419
from women and I wanted to make sure

00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:43,729
that there was a sound basis for this

00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:45,619
data and there is for anybody else is

00:18:43,729 --> 00:18:50,059
looking for it it's at the end of my

00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:53,210
deck so let's think about women and

00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:54,710
engineering overall let's start here so

00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,509
I had this a little other life-forms

00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:58,669
here before dreese yesterday with the

00:18:56,509 --> 00:19:00,440
alien in his deck but then I was

00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:03,139
confident leaving it in up till then I

00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,700
had as a placeholder for myself so let's

00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:07,789
assume that you know we've got half man

00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:10,639
half women more women graduate from

00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:12,979
college right now than men do but

00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:14,929
there's far more men graduating from

00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:18,529
stem particularly computer science

00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:20,570
programs and women and a much larger

00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:22,249
percentage of those participants go on

00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,749
to professional development roles and I

00:19:22,249 --> 00:19:25,399
think we're all familiar with this data

00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:28,580
so I'm going to go ahead and hold this

00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:30,409
for a second and move on one of the

00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,749
things I next want us to all be grounded

00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:35,690
in is a percentage of stem degrees

00:19:32,749 --> 00:19:39,909
relative to overall population and you

00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:43,099
can see that while white men are

00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:46,149
represented or are represented in large

00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:47,839
percentages within software engineering

00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:52,999
relative to their place in the

00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:55,519
population it's not that unexpected the

00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:58,009
number of black people and Hispanic

00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,389
people is way out of whack and this is

00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:02,619
something that we should look to shift

00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:05,359
if we're trying to encourage diversity

00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:07,669
let's next look at female attrition

00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,059
across science engineering and

00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:10,830
technology

00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:12,210
one of the reasons i like this slide is

00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,669
it shows that there's a couple of clear

00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,799
inflection points where we lose a lot of

00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:18,870
women out of engineering right out of

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,799
endor graduate programs a lot of them

00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:22,740
decide they don't want to be

00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:26,460
professional engineers later on in their

00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:30,629
mid 30s to early 40s a lot more women

00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:34,379
drop out lat again drop out 45 to 60

00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:37,080
that's probably a retirement and it's

00:20:34,379 --> 00:20:40,230
not because they're less committed or

00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:43,169
less smart or they're not performing as

00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:45,299
well as their male peers so if you look

00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:48,389
here at the prime motivators for why

00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:51,720
people go into engineering between men

00:20:48,389 --> 00:20:53,999
and women you'll see that they want to

00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,340
contribute to society they like making a

00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:59,419
lot of money they like receiving

00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:02,190
recognition for the work they do men

00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:06,179
slightly want a more powerful position

00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:10,230
clearly I'm an outlier there and then

00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:12,570
nets looked at young talent performance

00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:14,190
reviews so this is performance reviews

00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,929
of people a couple of years I believe

00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,789
this is two years of their undergraduate

00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:20,789
programs and you'll see that in

00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:22,619
engineering and technology women's

00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:25,309
performance reviews are actually better

00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:27,840
than men's so women are not leaving

00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:29,820
computer science and engineering because

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,909
they're not performing once they get in

00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:35,129
there and get those jobs let's talk

00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:39,480
about what the factors are for female

00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:42,809
attrition hostility isolation broken

00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:44,879
ladder the diving catch sixty-three

00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:47,490
percent of technical women experience

00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:50,009
harassment and bullying I think we're

00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,389
all familiar with these numbers I think

00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:53,639
most of us have probably had an

00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:58,159
opportunity to observe this for better

00:21:53,639 --> 00:22:02,340
for worse isolation women are lonely

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:05,580
when you're one of you know seven women

00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:07,740
on a hundred person team it's really

00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,019
hard to find somebody to just hang out

00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,269
and chat with and I was on this great

00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:14,850
team was all guys and me and I remember

00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:16,830
keeping track twice of the number of

00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:19,139
days I would go without seeing another

00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,800
woman in a meeting and two times in a

00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:23,260
row I mean any women

00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:27,040
Engineers program managers product

00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:30,430
managers EA any women twice I went 22

00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,780
days in a row I'm superstitious I don't

00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:33,910
like even numbers I don't like

00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:36,820
palindromes that really stuck with me

00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:38,830
and at the end of my second 22 days I

00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,650
remember talking to my friend sundeep

00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:45,100
was on my team about this he's like yeah

00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:47,230
we're getting coffee he said if you

00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,150
weren't on my team I'd easily go six

00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:51,700
months without seeing a woman like no

00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:55,240
way and then I started thinking about it

00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:57,730
and I realized I wasn't on his game that

00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,770
probably would be true it can be really

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:02,890
lonely you have to make an active effort

00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:05,830
to go out and make friends let's talk

00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:07,540
about the broken ladder problem the

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:09,160
broken ladder problems suggest that

00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,200
because there are fewer women in

00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,090
engineering management it's harder for

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,640
women to find their footing on a

00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:17,500
corporate ladder and so the rate of

00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,960
attrition they experience at thirty-five

00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,570
to forty percent is higher at that point

00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,880
for women than for men and there's a

00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,790
sweet spot it's not twenty percent it's

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,740
not half ten percent if your management

00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:32,050
ranks are comprised of ten percent women

00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,820
you're going to see a significant shift

00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:36,130
of the behavior of the other women

00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:38,320
associated with this organization you'll

00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:41,320
see that women are 22 times more likely

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,370
ones ahead ten percent to stay so if

00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,800
you're looking to increase the overall

00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:46,570
diversity of your engineering team in

00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,400
the form of women on your engineering

00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:52,600
team this is a number you can probably

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:55,510
influence and last the last factor if

00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:58,950
female attrition is called the diving

00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:01,690
catch so particularly within engineering

00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:04,210
promotions are often given to people who

00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:06,850
have stepped into a difficult emergency

00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:10,120
situation and made that diving catch to

00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:12,850
save it they flown on a plane to go to

00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,530
another country they've shown up for

00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:16,900
work at two o'clock in the morning

00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:19,240
they've taken on a high-risk project

00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:22,990
then you could fail and they delivered

00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:25,270
it to safety for women taking the risk

00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:29,230
of a diving catch is riskier than four

00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:31,940
men two reasons one if they fail we've

00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:33,889
already talked about the social factor

00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,720
they don't have the social network to

00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:40,639
help them rebound from that failure and

00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:42,379
two because there are so few mentors for

00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:44,529
those women when they're successful

00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:47,419
their successes are often unrecognized

00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:51,139
where a guy has a mentor who will

00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:53,509
trumpet that diving catch a come review

00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:55,960
cycle for example women often don't I

00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:59,179
will acknowledge that I had this and

00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,639
I've managed my career and a couple of

00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:05,000
diving catches and each time I've had a

00:25:01,639 --> 00:25:08,149
mentor they were men who were very clear

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,850
about the impact of my efforts in those

00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:12,980
high-risk situations those are critical

00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:18,639
factors that allowed me to grow my

00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:20,570
career as an exec so let's look now at

00:25:18,639 --> 00:25:24,139
proportion of men and women in

00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:27,169
engineering overall so give or take

00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:29,649
coming out of college approximately 41

00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:32,600
percent of the people who are available

00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:34,279
who have the technical skills to fill

00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:38,120
the open software development roles are

00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:40,700
women and I think we're all very

00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,129
familiar with the concept that your

00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,590
highest performing engineers are going

00:25:43,129 --> 00:25:50,149
to outperform your medium performing

00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:53,149
engineers it's about 10x so the way that

00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:54,950
really translates is twenty percent of

00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:57,080
the people on your engineering teams are

00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:59,720
going to be responsible for fifty

00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,639
percent of your results you really want

00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,669
to make sure those twenty percent are

00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:07,070
effective so it's 14 bugs left right I

00:26:04,669 --> 00:26:09,889
think there's 14 bugs left Andrew blade

00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:12,230
you want to get those solved go find

00:26:09,889 --> 00:26:13,399
your 20 percenters make sure they're

00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,470
throwing themselves against those

00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:18,080
problems right so I look at out of my

00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:20,480
engineering teams so let's assume at

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,460
this point that engineering talent the

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,799
best engineering talent is evenly

00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,000
distributed by gender given what we

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,549
looked at before with women's

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,519
performance reviews probably a safe bet

00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:35,720
at this stage we have something that

00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:38,779
looks like this now let's say that a

00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:41,570
large proportion of your women talent

00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:43,240
walks out the door somewhere between the

00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:46,980
ages of 35 and 40

00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:50,350
and suddenly you're looking like this

00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:52,809
you've just lost sixteen percent of your

00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:56,400
high performing talent if you're in a

00:26:52,809 --> 00:27:01,809
competitive situation that is painful

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:04,330
but what's more painful for me is that

00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:07,290
it's not just women who are leaving

00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:09,640
engineering men leave engineering too

00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:12,100
and what a lot of people don't talk

00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:15,240
about is manly software engineering

00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:18,370
almost of the rates that women do and

00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,990
it's not just that I'm losing those

00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,760
sixteen percent of high performers

00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:24,370
because I've got women of walk out the

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:28,090
door I have people walking out the door

00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:30,880
and this is true across software again

00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:33,550
I've got the data on the back of my deck

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:37,000
for this this is something we don't

00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:41,110
often talk about people quit software

00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,450
development fifty-five percent of your

00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:45,720
high performing developers are walking

00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:49,000
out of the industry before they're 45

00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,100
it's not just women this is not

00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,250
necessarily at this point a diversity

00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:56,770
problem while you might want more women

00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:58,990
more people frankly on your team's to

00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:01,960
increase their overall intellectual

00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:04,179
capacity and productivity we really need

00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:08,500
to solve for is keeping more of these

00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:10,470
people to pool overall one of the things

00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:14,500
that's interesting about this data is

00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:16,030
that of the men who lead the industry or

00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,309
leave software engineering rather sorry

00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:20,470
about that forty-eight percent of them

00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:22,900
leave because they found something else

00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:24,850
in which they can make more money maybe

00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:27,160
they're going to consulting maybe

00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:28,570
they're doing who-knows-what forty-eight

00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,370
percent of them leave because they can

00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:33,820
make more money doing something else of

00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:37,179
the ones who leave women tend to leave

00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:39,429
for other reasons and as a result the

00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:41,440
proportion of women who have left

00:28:39,429 --> 00:28:43,750
engineering the want to come back

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,360
significantly higher seventy-eight

00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:49,450
percent that suggests that there's an

00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:51,700
opportunity here to recoup talent that

00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:54,309
has walked out the door if we find ways

00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,380
to make it easier for these contributors

00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:57,450
to on-ramp

00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,220
to the communities and that gives us an

00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:01,680
opportunity to not only bring back

00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:04,470
talent overall but to recoup some of

00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,970
that high performing talent that we saw

00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:09,510
walk out the door one of our earlier

00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:11,610
slides now if this is what your

00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:16,260
community looks like it's going to be

00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:20,430
tougher and within Open Source the

00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:23,600
largest the average contributor opens

00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:25,800
first projects is a 27 year old male

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:31,350
this is about to become Jermaine

00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:34,140
everybody in the room when I looked at

00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:36,330
why women are leaving open source

00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:40,080
projects or why that contribution

00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:42,870
factors 2.5% I was struck by something

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,240
really interesting there's not a lot of

00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:47,790
good study done on it one of the most

00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:51,330
thorough is this one right here and what

00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:54,810
this talks about is the fact that while

00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:58,160
women begin to lurk at the same rates of

00:29:54,810 --> 00:30:00,540
men and while women begin to make

00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,940
additional queries in the community at

00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:06,180
the same rights as men women are more

00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:08,160
likely to road from participation and

00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:11,910
one of the factors is not that those

00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:14,460
women themselves receive more vietri all

00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:17,010
or a less warm welcome because

00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:19,440
statistically they don't statistically

00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:23,070
they receive the same amount of v trail

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:26,400
is any new be joining a community but

00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:28,020
that seems to have a greater impact on

00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,380
them not the vitriol that they

00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:33,480
themselves receive but the dynamics they

00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:36,210
observe and the community itself and

00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,970
this is what I find to be fascinating

00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:41,910
about Drupal as community is that this

00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:44,880
is a community like Python that is

00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:48,150
systematically made an effort to make

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,010
sure that all participants are welcome

00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:52,920
in these communities that all

00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:55,680
participants find their footing and that

00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:58,020
in and of itself seems to be a factor

00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:02,190
and increasing the overall diversity of

00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:04,500
the Drupal and Python communities if you

00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:06,960
want more diversity if you want to be

00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:09,130
more competitive you want more women

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,830
it's a really safe play

00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:15,280
sister women can be ferociously

00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:18,970
competitive they're certainly interested

00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:21,550
in achieving the satisfaction

00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:24,760
contributing the product projects it's a

00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:27,280
good place to start if you want to be

00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:29,260
competitive overall it's not just about

00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,420
bringing out more women it's about

00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:34,150
finding ways to increase the

00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:35,980
intellectual and social diversity of all

00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:38,920
the people within your community and

00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:41,440
also finding a way to help them

00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:43,630
communicate more effectively amongst

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,380
each other than the incumbent players

00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:49,750
you're competing against if you've got

00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:51,400
those two pieces you've got the

00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:53,530
diversity and you've got the

00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:56,320
communication skills you're going to

00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:59,800
build a better more sustainable war

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:02,410
competitive community let's talk a

00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,750
little bit about blossom Python this

00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:06,880
comes out of a deck I saw Jessica

00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:09,940
mckellar and Angie Byron deliver last

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,130
fall at all things open and Jessa

00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:14,050
mckellar went ahead and she was trying

00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:16,570
to address the problem at diversity of

00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:18,760
the Boston Python community she made

00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:21,760
some changes she made the documentation

00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:23,830
better she helped drive warmer

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,530
engagement and less aggression in the

00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:29,800
community overall and what she saw is

00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:31,810
that very rapidly that community not

00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,490
only increase its overall percentage of

00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:35,980
women they increase it to fifteen

00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:38,200
percent but the size of the community

00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:40,870
itself grew enormously grew to seventeen

00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:43,120
hundred participants it's now three

00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:46,420
thousand participants which is very very

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:49,930
big for a local user group and remains

00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:54,640
fifteen percent women Tim you know who

00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:56,440
this guy is scanning Bob Sutton he used

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,230
to be a professor at Harvard he's now a

00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:02,170
professor at Stanford he's done a lot of

00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:05,830
groundbreaking work on the impact to

00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:09,490
your corporation to your workplace team

00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:11,590
of having a jerk on your team and what

00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:14,780
he discovered is that even a

00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:17,220
high-performing jerk not worth it

00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:19,470
because they rode the ability of that

00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:22,430
team to communicate they rode the

00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:25,470
overall productivity on that team and

00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:28,160
having a jerk on your team or having

00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:31,170
otherwise nice people act like jerks

00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:35,660
lowers the overall competitiveness of

00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:39,840
your team he wrote this great article

00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:42,480
nasty people and this is where he began

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:46,470
to quantify the impact of having nasty

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,690
people jerks in your community and it

00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:51,300
turns out based on a branch of game

00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:53,970
theory around altruism but there's a

00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:56,340
formula or determining the optimal

00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:58,680
amount of cooperation nice behavior and

00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,840
jerky behavior that you want your

00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:03,030
community you want a little bit of jerky

00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:06,210
behavior in your community and here's

00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:09,900
why because a community that is always

00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:12,000
nice and only nice invites other more

00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:15,630
aggressive communities to move in and

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,610
disrupt its productivity if on the other

00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:20,760
hand you've got a community where

00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:22,770
everybody is a jerk all the time there's

00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,990
not enough cooperation taking place

00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:27,810
within that community to allow that

00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:33,240
community to be productive and the sweet

00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:35,850
spot is one nice gesture and then so

00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:39,480
one-third of mean gestures to every nice

00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:42,030
gesture that is the optimal ratio and

00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:45,840
I've included links to the papers here

00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:47,220
you guys want to see it and when I was

00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,440
first being trained to manage large

00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,820
engineering teams I was taught that

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,950
there were things that I did

00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:55,740
characteristics that i showed as an

00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:58,370
individual that made it really difficult

00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:03,480
for me to manage mega engineering teams

00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:05,370
sarcasm it's one I love sarcasm turns

00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,010
out that if you're sarcastic all the

00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:09,630
time at scale you can really erode

00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:12,300
morale and productivity on an

00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:14,730
engineering team but I can't be nice all

00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:17,160
the time because every once in a while

00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:20,610
somebody's going to ask something stupid

00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:24,210
and I have to say seriously

00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:26,640
and if I do that but I'm mostly nice but

00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:28,770
occasionally I'm like seriously it keeps

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,410
the stupid behavior in check it keeps

00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:33,540
the bad behavior in check somebody on my

00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:36,510
team does something just bullying I'm

00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:39,540
like really and that keeps behavior in

00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:43,050
check so it's important to not be nice

00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:44,880
all the time you have to figure out what

00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:48,120
that ratio is to keep the healthy

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:52,110
community here Bob Sutton wrote a book

00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:53,910
about this I never swear this way

00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:55,650
certainly don't throw on stage so I'm

00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:57,450
not going to repeat the title do you

00:35:55,650 --> 00:36:00,120
guys can all look for it it's a great

00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:01,920
book and it talks about the dynamics of

00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:06,230
building healthy communities and why a

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:08,400
workplace or a team can't sustain jerks

00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:11,430
but basically here's what he talks about

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,040
like here's a list of things that lists

00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:15,960
behaviors you want to avoid happening

00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,390
across your team because it's just going

00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:22,010
to erode the productivity event of your

00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:25,470
team insult violation of personal space

00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:28,950
unsolicited touching threats sarcasm

00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:32,670
flames humiliation shaming interruption

00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:35,640
I do that one too backbiting glaring

00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:38,430
snubbing and what I find to be

00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:41,460
fascinating about this list is he

00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:43,980
developed this list based on his

00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:46,290
studying of corporate environments which

00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,350
are significantly male this was never a

00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:52,560
gendered list the fact that this lines

00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:54,630
up really nicely against what a lot of

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,950
women asked for in a code of conduct is

00:36:54,630 --> 00:37:00,690
really interesting to me let's go back

00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:02,760
to a notion of women on a team as a

00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:05,580
proxy for the overall health of the

00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:08,190
diversity on a team if you want to

00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:10,590
ensure the overall productivity of your

00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:14,090
team these are behaviors you're going to

00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:18,600
adopt regardless of the proportion of

00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:20,760
diversity on your team if you want to

00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,100
encourage more contributions within an

00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,830
open source community be thoughtful

00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:28,650
about the ratio at which you deploy

00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:31,220
these behaviors be thoughtful about the

00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:33,890
ratio at which you deploy sarcasm or

00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:37,490
which you deploy interrupting

00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:40,440
find a way to make it productive rare

00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:43,470
have to have it happen a little bit but

00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:46,320
make sure it's productive at the end of

00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:49,350
the day basically what Bob Sutton is

00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,510
saying is the most competitive team is

00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:54,510
the one with the highest variation

00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:59,250
skills niversity and the smallest number

00:37:54,510 --> 00:38:03,690
of jerks not quite what this looks like

00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:05,720
but it is what this looks like I took

00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:08,460
this yesterday walking down the hallway

00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:12,210
this is just sort of a random crowd shot

00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:14,880
here at drupalcon this community looks a

00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:17,490
lot like that ideal representation of

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,440
diversity and that effective set of

00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:22,590
communication skills that is being

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,460
actively practiced with an eye toward

00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:27,660
managing most effective levels

00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:34,080
contributions from the highest possible

00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:36,120
level of contributors scruple let's go

00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:38,490
back to this slide which is similar to

00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,980
the one that I showed before but this

00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:44,340
slide represents the proportion of

00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:48,000
attendees of drupalcon this year who are

00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:50,310
women that is astonishingly high it's

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,890
yellow by the way in case you weren't

00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:54,870
able to figure that out that's

00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:57,540
astonishingly high for an open source

00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:59,970
community and if we're just looking at

00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:02,730
that is a proxy indicator for how well

00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:06,110
this particular community is doing at

00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:09,120
encouraging diverse points of view and

00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:11,550
variation and its contributors this is a

00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:14,010
really good indicator this is something

00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:16,880
that we should preserve and protect this

00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:19,920
frankly is something that a lot of large

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,620
competitive software companies would

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,080
like to be achieving on their teams this

00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:27,600
is an asset that this community has

00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:32,970
built that this community has can

00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:36,270
leverage to be competitive a time we're

00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:39,330
moving all of us all of our CMS's 21 CMS

00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:41,340
and we're moving to Drupal this is not

00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:43,230
something that a few years ago I would

00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:45,990
have predicted but I would be willing to

00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:49,800
do its combination of things

00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:51,780
I'm a fan of Drupal 8 i'm a big fan of

00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,670
the fact that the Drupal community is

00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:57,390
growing and that means it's going to be

00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:59,700
easier for me to find talent to work on

00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:02,730
the projects and the products that I

00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:05,850
need to bring into the marketplace most

00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:08,460
importantly I need to make sure that I

00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:10,920
have diversity of thought and the teams

00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:13,380
that are building my products the ones

00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,869
that are directly on my team's a time

00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:19,080
and the ones in the communities on which

00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:21,810
I have a deep and long term commitment

00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:25,080
and a deep long-term dependency and

00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:27,480
that's Drupal more than any other CMS

00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:30,660
more than any other option that I can

00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:33,360
look at so thank you very much for your

00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:36,119
time here's the list the data sources

00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:37,920
behind what I talk to you today if I've

00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:39,869
missed something and you would like to

00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,320
find out about my data go ahead and hit

00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:46,980
me up on LinkedIn it's er Y and n I'm

00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:50,160
pretty easy to find and also last but

00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:56,040
not least I like every other SVP of

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:58,830
engineering is hiring I am hosting

00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:01,109
dinner tonight at Frank you guys haven't

00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:02,250
been to Frank go not a six o'clock or

00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:05,040
you're going to make it longer for my

00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:06,930
order to command but the first 30 people

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,630
who think that they might want to work

00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:13,050
for one of our teams were in Seattle New

00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:15,180
York Birmingham London come on up to the

00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:17,609
stage afterward we'll put you on the

00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:19,890
list and we'll take you to dinner me

00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:22,440
some of my time compatriots here i'd

00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:24,990
really like to hire into my engineering

00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,510
teams the sort of diversity that i see

00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:30,270
in the Drupal community not again

00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:32,670
because I'm particularly nice except

00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:35,910
when I'm actively have to be because of

00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:38,130
that ratio but because I'm competitive

00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:42,380
and I want to build the best stuff for

00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:42,380
my audience thank you very much

00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:56,049
hey thank you very much champaign county

00:41:52,799 --> 00:41:59,529
so you mentioned the word jerk a few

00:41:56,049 --> 00:42:01,900
times and when I heard that right I hear

00:41:59,529 --> 00:42:05,260
aggressive behavior is it is that the

00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:09,130
same or is it different I think it's

00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:11,950
different so I think of myself as being

00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:15,039
quiet introverted people who know me

00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:17,380
socially cannot believe that I get up on

00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:19,630
stage and talk to people natively I'm an

00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:21,700
introvert I don't think of myself as a

00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:23,349
jerk and it took me a while to realize

00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:26,380
that I had a couple of those behaviors

00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:28,329
that are really drink behaviors I can be

00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:31,029
sarcastic a lot of the times I can

00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:33,789
interrupt I think examining my own

00:42:31,029 --> 00:42:36,400
behavior first has really led me to be

00:42:33,789 --> 00:42:39,099
thoughtful about what signifies a jerk

00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,750
it's not just about being aggressive so

00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:43,000
I look at it as when you were talking

00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:46,809
about i was thinking and I have friends

00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,849
that I want to be on their side in a bar

00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:51,339
fight right right that's kind of what I

00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:53,410
was you know making the analogy with

00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:55,319
where you need people on your team who

00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:58,779
are not only going to be aggressive

00:42:55,319 --> 00:43:00,369
within the team but stand up and fight

00:42:58,779 --> 00:43:03,160
for the team as well is that kind of

00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:05,289
what you're going after them no but it's

00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:07,329
funny you would ask that because I've

00:43:05,289 --> 00:43:08,769
done a couple of startups one of the

00:43:07,329 --> 00:43:11,740
things this is sort of an ongoing joke

00:43:08,769 --> 00:43:12,940
amongst our friends as you say you want

00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:15,910
to work with people who have been in bar

00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:17,680
fights I have been in bar fights it's

00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:20,950
not something that I want my children to

00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:23,890
necessarily do but it's a really

00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:25,450
interesting indicator right of the

00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:28,390
degree to which I'm willing to engage

00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:30,519
and yeah it's not something I advocate

00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:31,869
doing necessarily but yeah being

00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:33,609
somebody who's been in a bar fight

00:43:31,869 --> 00:43:35,680
somebody you want in your hip pocket all

00:43:33,609 --> 00:43:38,769
right so now this ratio okay so they

00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,269
said 43 nice I don't know what the word

00:43:38,769 --> 00:43:42,220
to have these gestures yeah we used

00:43:40,269 --> 00:43:45,099
three nice gestures there's one the

00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:46,809
right ratio was one jerk gesture that's

00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:49,170
about right okay so I know a lot of

00:43:46,809 --> 00:43:52,269
people in the community yes and I can go

00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:54,549
days or weeks without seeing one of

00:43:52,269 --> 00:43:56,769
those jerk gestures it's not a sign that

00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:59,559
we're not healthy or am I just not

00:43:56,769 --> 00:44:03,339
paying attention to the rice long that's

00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:05,980
a long list be insulting the bullying

00:44:03,339 --> 00:44:08,859
the lack of respect of physical

00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:11,289
boundaries I would argue that those are

00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:14,230
behaviors that probably carry our

00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:15,640
heavier overall weight so one of the

00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:17,559
classic ways a lot of people talk about

00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,539
it is when they talk about the fact that

00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:21,549
women don't like to be touched unless

00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:24,220
you know you say it's okay to be touched

00:44:21,549 --> 00:44:26,529
but what they often don't talk about is

00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:28,210
that men do that too so if you guys have

00:44:26,529 --> 00:44:30,910
all seen the middle management suck-up

00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:32,890
guy who's trying to like suck up and

00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:34,359
show his organizational prowess and i'll

00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:35,980
come up behind you and he'll like put

00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:38,799
his arm around you and tap you on the

00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:40,720
shoulder it's so annoying it's annoying

00:44:38,799 --> 00:44:42,700
if you're a guy and a guy doesn't you

00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,990
it's annoying if you're a woman and does

00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,640
you it's just a complete lack of respect

00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:49,269
of personal space and so i would say

00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:51,819
there's a long list of behaviors there

00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:54,039
and someone who can be deployed in a

00:44:51,819 --> 00:44:56,589
lightweight effective way sarcasm is one

00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:58,359
of my very favorites and so I think

00:44:56,589 --> 00:45:00,339
there are ways to mediate that I'm not

00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:01,869
advocating for more droopy havior angels

00:45:00,339 --> 00:45:03,490
I'm ignoring everyone's questions if I'm

00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:06,220
fascinated with this whole jerk thing so

00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:10,480
let me let me just go one more stuff

00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:11,769
okay does the medium matter meaning you

00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,019
know a lot of times we spent a lot of

00:45:11,769 --> 00:45:17,170
our times on IRC and informs words

00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:19,839
written and its permanent is the ratio

00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:22,930
different if its face to face versus

00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:26,079
online that's a great question I've

00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:28,569
never seen data on that okay my gut says

00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:30,230
I'm so yummy I'm gonna say yes yeah yeah

00:45:28,569 --> 00:45:31,970
you're married right under

00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:33,950
very more than once I could probably

00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:35,990
speak to this if it's there it's

00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:37,730
documented and you can go back and see

00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:39,440
it over and over again it's an

00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:41,810
opportunity to continually in flight in

00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,640
this situation right I think that's

00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:45,500
where i'm seein ya when i saw that

00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,330
that's three two one or four to one

00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:50,440
ratio right that's where I kind of went

00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:52,940
I don't see that but I think it might be

00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,859
the medium that is delivered in it could

00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:57,500
very well be and there was a great piece

00:45:54,859 --> 00:45:59,210
on NPR I'm going to say it was 34 years

00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:01,400
ago now they covered a lot of this in

00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:02,990
depth so if you're interested if anybody

00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,570
else is interested it was a great

00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:08,000
layman's introduction to this concept

00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:09,530
the mathematical basis for altruism okay

00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,740
it's a great place to start all right

00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:13,940
I'm gonna let go the jerk thing for now

00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:15,530
all right so Doug drinking had a

00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,200
question which related something I was

00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:19,520
thinking about as well but he asked what

00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,340
is free and open source software doing

00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,990
wrong with respect to diversity when the

00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:26,210
introductions are generally anonymous

00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:29,300
handles and we don't know each other's

00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:31,790
genders and colors that study that I

00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:33,830
showed that I cited participation and

00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:36,170
free and open source communities by

00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:37,820
gender was really interesting it's very

00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:39,470
very long it's very dense of all the

00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:41,840
links i have up there it's by far the

00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:43,460
most dense and that was something the

00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:46,760
researchers struggled with and they

00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:50,660
realized that there were consistent

00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:53,140
markers of gender and how people engage

00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:57,010
in the community that led them to

00:46:53,140 --> 00:47:01,150
identify male and female participants

00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:04,790
however note that what I pointed out

00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:08,060
about the way that free and open source

00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:11,030
communities engage is not that women

00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:14,570
themselves are more frequently targets

00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:16,940
of aggressive behavior than men so it's

00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:19,340
not that anybody is saying women are

00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:23,240
being more are targeted more frequently

00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:26,900
it's that they observe the impact

00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:29,570
differently than men do and so what I

00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:32,240
think is going on is that those few

00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:34,609
women in the community are an early

00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:37,430
warning sign so to speak of an overall

00:47:34,609 --> 00:47:39,140
lack of health and the community at law

00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:40,069
the colma canary in the coal mine you

00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:42,470
know if you look at the Drupal community

00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:44,210
there's a lot of diversity of the Drupal

00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:46,430
community all sorts of diversity it's

00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:49,760
not just gender diversity there's class

00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:51,920
aversions divert the diversity sushi

00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,599
graphic diversity their skillset

00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,950
diversity there's a whole bunch of

00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,380
different points adversity and I think

00:47:54,950 --> 00:48:00,400
that one of the hallmarks of Drupal and

00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:02,599
again Python as communities is the

00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,359
mechanisms that they've used to deploy

00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:06,950
to make sure that communication is nice

00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:08,420
to make sure that it is easy to

00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:10,609
contribute to make sure that people do

00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:12,740
you feel welcome nothing would make

00:48:10,609 --> 00:48:14,569
person feel more welcome than Megan

00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:17,750
dancing across stage to walking on

00:48:14,569 --> 00:48:19,369
sunshine that was awesome those are

00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:21,260
hallmarks of a healthy community and I

00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:24,050
think that's what we have all right but

00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:26,480
is it is it an advantage for a community

00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:27,650
like ours where much of the initial

00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,200
interaction and much of the ongoing

00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:32,839
interaction is through this you know

00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:35,420
online medium where you know our

00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:38,119
diversity isn't you know it's not I

00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:40,339
guess on display right just your your

00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:41,930
username and an IRC window your username

00:48:40,339 --> 00:48:44,359
amount of form does that give us an

00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:46,339
advantage over you know organizations

00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:48,770
and open source organizations probably

00:48:46,339 --> 00:48:50,630
aren't the best example we're more of

00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:51,829
its face to face then you know you and I

00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:53,210
had a little conversation yesterday

00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:55,220
where you talked about the fact that

00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:57,770
because you've been in this community

00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:59,390
for so long you don't sometimes see the

00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:01,280
things that are unique to this community

00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:03,079
I've engaged with a lot of different

00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,000
open source communities over the last

00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:07,250
few years and one of the things that I

00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,290
see in other open source communities

00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:10,609
that frankly have never observed within

00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:12,260
the Drupal community i'm not saying

00:49:10,609 --> 00:49:17,290
doesn't exist I'm just saying I haven't

00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:19,940
seen it is either a subtle or a strident

00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:21,349
declaration of feelings as to whether or

00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:23,270
not women should even be in that

00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:25,780
community in the first place or whether

00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:29,030
this is even a conversation worth having

00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:31,220
those comments are often to be found in

00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:34,040
other communities I just don't see them

00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:36,910
in this one and I think the very absence

00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:40,010
of those dynamics within this community

00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:42,349
marks that one almost immediately to

00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:45,920
someone new to this community as a

00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:48,530
friendly one as a warm one all right let

00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:52,700
me switch topics a little bit

00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:55,370
we find my question here so you talked

00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:57,560
about nutrition and stemming attrition

00:49:55,370 --> 00:50:02,300
not not capitalist p.m. but very

00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:03,860
interesting um how can we you know from

00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,720
what I got from when you were talking it

00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:07,670
seems like mentoring it's a pretty big

00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,770
hammer that we can wield yet to help

00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:11,810
stem that are there and would you agree

00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:13,220
that that is for honestly like ours the

00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:15,140
single most important thing we can do

00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:16,370
and the data suggest that so the two

00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:19,550
things that I observed to be the most

00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:21,920
powerful is mentoring a woman with a

00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:23,780
mentor is 11 times more likely to stay

00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:27,680
within a community than a woman without

00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:29,840
a mentor so finding ways to make sure

00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,520
that those women in a community have

00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:33,500
that mentor is really important if

00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,870
that's an area of diversity you will not

00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:37,640
as one right it's not just another slide

00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:39,530
you actually all right right right we

00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:41,150
didn't that's why I'm being very talk

00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:43,190
about this is that while the data

00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:45,170
suggests that that's an influence factor

00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:47,450
for women as a diverse community I don't

00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:49,160
know about other communities in which

00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:51,140
you want to increase the engagement so I

00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,640
specifically can only suggest to speak

00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:54,740
to the data I've seen which is

00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:58,460
influencing that cohort of a diverse

00:50:54,740 --> 00:51:00,860
community and then the second thing is

00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:02,180
just women in leadership roles that has

00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:04,160
an impact on women as a diverse

00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:06,080
community as a diverse cohort if you're

00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,750
trying to increase that retention number

00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:12,110
okay so you threw a lot of data at us

00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:13,580
was this us specific or do these numbers

00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:18,200
hold up internationally we're very

00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:22,360
international organization so everything

00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:26,450
that I cited in the slides I used was

00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:29,210
specifically us data except the faust

00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:32,240
data the free and open source data that

00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:35,290
set of data in and of itself is around

00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:38,180
world wide open source programs and

00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:39,800
that's all called out and the sources

00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:41,990
that I have I would like to have more

00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:44,330
data about divorce diversity in the

00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:47,120
communities overall and that's something

00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:49,370
I'm actively looking to find okay so I'm

00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:51,800
happy to have that just a couple more

00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:54,470
here um you talked early on your

00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,900
presentation about we have to be

00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:57,849
actively engaged

00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:59,500
an increase in diversity trees don't

00:51:57,849 --> 00:52:01,510
walk themselves out I just can't sit

00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:04,359
back you guys true that happened right

00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:06,789
right so specifically for open source

00:52:04,359 --> 00:52:09,039
communities we just touched on mentoring

00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:11,740
but what other types of programs have

00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:13,510
you seen that would be good to take I

00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:16,329
think we're at about twenty percent yeah

00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:19,200
I'm women so how can we bring that to 34

00:52:16,329 --> 00:52:21,609
and 50 and Beyond 50 would be tough

00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,920
you've got your drawing from a very

00:52:21,609 --> 00:52:25,660
specific pool it's a great goal I think

00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,730
that would be tough it's something that

00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:29,559
I think about to quite a bit one of the

00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:32,770
most effective ways that I've seen to be

00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:34,720
able to grow the population of

00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:37,150
contributors in your community and grow

00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:39,190
diverse population as well is to

00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:42,220
contribute to camps which you guys are

00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:44,380
doing and also contribute to classes and

00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:46,569
making sure that learning materials are

00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:49,319
available online I'm on the board of

00:52:46,569 --> 00:52:51,640
girl develop it and girl develop it as I

00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:53,710
ironically named and the goal is to get

00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:55,859
more people but particularly adult women

00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:59,680
engaged in software engineering and

00:52:55,859 --> 00:53:01,750
we've graduated over 5500 women from our

00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,480
technical classes in the last three

00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:06,279
years that's a huge number we're now

00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,829
scaled out the end of this quarter i

00:53:06,279 --> 00:53:11,230
think we'll be in 43 cities across the

00:53:08,829 --> 00:53:13,450
u.s. and i think we'll have somewhere

00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:15,880
around five cities internationally and

00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:18,420
that's a great cheap and effective way

00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:20,829
to roll out learning materials and

00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:22,869
increase the number of women in your

00:53:20,829 --> 00:53:24,400
community so there's there's places you

00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:25,750
can pull levers like that or donations

00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,859
that he says you should contribute to

00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:31,809
camps yes in like financially or even

00:53:29,859 --> 00:53:33,760
just holding them no I don't ya just

00:53:31,809 --> 00:53:35,470
having a good as many guys working out

00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,779
of place accessible making it accessible

00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:43,750
or content come and learn and engage yep

00:53:37,779 --> 00:53:48,400
ok very good um to do if we have one

00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:50,950
more in here yes okay so this is from a

00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,890
Vivek star on Twitter if a Drupal

00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:55,660
community is open and welcoming what are

00:53:53,890 --> 00:54:01,950
the continuing barriers to entry for

00:53:55,660 --> 00:54:04,859
women and people of color I would say

00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:07,769
that the greater

00:54:04,859 --> 00:54:10,440
is that as you grow that percentage

00:54:07,769 --> 00:54:12,900
falls away so the challenge really

00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:16,589
becomes how do you maintain the ratios

00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:18,119
that you have today as you grow the

00:54:16,589 --> 00:54:20,640
Drupal community is going to be facing

00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:22,980
all sorts of challenges over the next

00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,499
couple of years the release of Drupal 8

00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:27,960
is an inflection point that I think is

00:54:25,499 --> 00:54:30,720
not well understood even by most

00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:32,880
constituents in the space it's not just

00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,980
that this is an amazing suite of

00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,809
software it's that it's coming out in a

00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,220
period of time where the incumbent

00:54:36,809 --> 00:54:40,140
players are fighting for market share

00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,460
they're fighting with their platforms

00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,589
they're fighting with their distribution

00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,940
channels the major media companies are

00:54:43,589 --> 00:54:47,369
finally developing the technical

00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:49,109
sophistication to compete head-on and

00:54:47,369 --> 00:54:51,599
question the efficacy it the way they've

00:54:49,109 --> 00:54:53,190
been partner with those channels they're

00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:55,230
looking at the large closed source

00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:57,599
commercial system at most amusing and

00:54:55,230 --> 00:55:00,059
they're like a Drupal looks pretty good

00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,529
but that also means that within the

00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:03,839
Drupal community itself that's a

00:55:01,529 --> 00:55:05,609
significant change that's a big change

00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:11,279
for the Drupal community to go from

00:55:05,609 --> 00:55:13,890
being the small happy warm sort of

00:55:11,279 --> 00:55:16,140
lately commercial community to one that

00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:18,720
has found significant footing at the

00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:21,150
enterprise level and a lot of the

00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,950
characteristics that benefited Drupal

00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:25,619
over the last few years since inception

00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:27,900
really around warmth and openness and

00:55:25,619 --> 00:55:30,779
friendliness engaging have come from

00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:32,910
that population of contributors who feel

00:55:30,779 --> 00:55:35,279
that just being a person walking around

00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:37,079
those are the characteristics that you

00:55:35,279 --> 00:55:38,400
should show to the world those are the

00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:40,680
characteristics you should Emily light

00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,079
as you become bigger and more

00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:44,069
commercially attractive making sure that

00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:45,989
you're fighting to keep those

00:55:44,069 --> 00:55:48,569
characteristics in place and keeping

00:55:45,989 --> 00:55:50,489
that constituent diverse voice alive is

00:55:48,569 --> 00:55:52,440
going to be really important I mean is

00:55:50,489 --> 00:55:55,170
this something that you know we should

00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:57,809
be actively marketing like we're more

00:55:55,170 --> 00:56:01,079
diverse than other I mean how far does

00:55:57,809 --> 00:56:03,269
this how far do we take this I mean it's

00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:05,549
one thing to be diverse and to be proud

00:56:03,269 --> 00:56:08,190
of it yeah to grow this you know a

00:56:05,549 --> 00:56:10,289
healthy diverse community but should we

00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:13,499
be leveraging it that's a really good

00:56:10,289 --> 00:56:15,900
question so talking about diversity is a

00:56:13,499 --> 00:56:18,580
double-edged sword I can talk about

00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:20,560
diversity because I

00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:23,380
about it from a very practical point of

00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:25,630
view but it's difficult to even say the

00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:28,120
word diversity without people having a

00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:30,280
variety of emotional reactions to the

00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:33,820
term and that's something that's really

00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:35,800
hard to handle and branding right I'm

00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:38,320
not entirely sure i'm not sure that i

00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:40,360
would play that as a starting point for

00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,790
establishing yourself as a commercially

00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:45,060
viable option but i'm absolutely sure

00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:47,890
that i would plan as a card for

00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:50,140
continuing to recruit contributors of

00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:52,300
diverse intellectual background systemic

00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:53,680
coming rather than coming back on yeah

00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,830
all right very good well we are out of

00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,830
