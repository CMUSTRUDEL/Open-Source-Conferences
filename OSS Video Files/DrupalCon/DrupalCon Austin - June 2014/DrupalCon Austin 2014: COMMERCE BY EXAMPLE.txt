Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: COMMERCE BY EXAMPLE
Publication date: 2014-06-05
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: joshmillernvahalik
In this session, Josh Miller and Nick Vahalik from Commerce Guys will explore adding and configuring commerce on new and existing sites. Designed to be a follow-along lab, we'll have downloadable installs ready for your use so you can participate in all of the excitement. As much as possible, we'll use existing core and contrib modules and keep the coding to a minimum.

IN THIS SESSION WE'LL COVER...

SETTING UP A SUBSCRIPTION ON A BLOG

In this example, we take a blog and add the ability to create premium content so that only paid subscribers can get access.

ADDING PRODUCTS TO EXISTING CONTENT PAGES

Have an existing site that you want to utilize for commerce? We'll convert an existing catalog site into an online store.

DONATION SITE

Taking donations is a very common task -- let's make it easy and set it up in a flash.

REGISTRATIONS

Ah, good old registrations. In this demo, we'll setup a site that allows you to offer basic registrations with a couple of options.

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,809
example and we're glad that you guys

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:17,400
have decided to choose us for your last

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:19,710
session at drupalcon we're going to try

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,680
to keep this as as light and as lively

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,199
as we possibly can and we're really glad

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,970

00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:34,860
session that we will have a break in the

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,059
middle where you can go the bathroom but

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,670
we're going to try to keep it to five

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:41,129
minutes in the middle so two-hour

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,250
sessions are good for working through

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:46,320
the problems as we go along so if you

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,649

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,149
the presentation to try to follow along

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:57,090

talk about drupal commerce and how much

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,830
you can do with commerce and how

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,509
commerce is very different from a lot of

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:23,430
other systems and i'm josh and i've been

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,130

merit and a big part of what I do at

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,890
Commerce guys is trying to help people

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:39,360
understand how to use commerce and do

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,329
everything I can to answer your

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,799
questions throughout the year on drupal

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:48,000
commerce org on IRC on twitter and just

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,070
about anywhere else we might run into

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,880
each other at camps and so forth so

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:58,110
don't be afraid to ask questions because

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,700
both Nick and I are very used to running

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,450
point on a lot of the community

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,450
questions that come up

00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:10,070
but that's enough about us what about

00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:12,320

modules okay okay excellent and out of

00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,240
anybody here just show hands who's with

00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:55,280
like an agency who does work for other

work for yourselves work for a company

00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:05,690

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:07,760
okay all right well that's great so what

00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,959
are we going to do today first thing

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,850
we're going to do is we're going to

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,940
cover some instructions josh is going to

00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:17,000
cover those instructions and as best we

00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:19,459
can then we're going to talk a little

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,190
bit about best practices really kind of

00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:24,170
cursory overview something everybody

00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,690
here should know but we're going to go

00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:29,120
over it one more time then we're going

00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:31,300
to do the catalog and registration hands

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,340
on we're going to take an existing

00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:37,760
catalog site we're going to add commerce

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,920
on to that catalog site and then along

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,380
the inside of that site as well will

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,260
enable the ability to have a kind of an

00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:48,800
event registration a checkout process or

00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:51,380
flow depending on how long that takes we

00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,780
should have some time for Q&A or we can

00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,910
break a little early if we have some

00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,950
extra time and then when we come back

00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,680
from the break at two fifteen will do

00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:03,980
the blog subscription and then the

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,900
donation or tip jar hands on and then

00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:13,970
the the remainder of our time we will

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:15,990
use with as well for QA and wrap up all

00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,930
right Josh okay so we're going to be

00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:21,000

00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:24,180
link right here if you type it into your

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,400
browser oh wait that doesn't work oh I

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,310

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,460
updated imagine that link says drupal

00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:35,130
commerce org slash commerce stash by

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,100
dash example so that's the title of our

00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:42,930
presentation the you are the the domain

00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:45,150
is Drupal commerce org that particular

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,920
link will take you to a quick post that

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,650
if you're following along before the

00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:53,480
presentation I put up all the files that

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:57,210
we're going to be using for the various

00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:59,160
demo sites that we have so these demo

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:02,370
sites what we've done is we've built to

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:06,390
kind of fantasy sites that don't really

00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:09,030
exist but could and often do run

00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:11,160
actually come to us as Commerce guys and

00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,080
say people will say hey I've got a

00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,300
catalogue site i'ma pop I'm a book

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,620
publisher I list a lot of books but i

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,960
really want to start selling them or

00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:22,470
i've got a blog and i really want to

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,910
sell premium content so we have some

00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,590
example sites for you guys to get

00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:29,100
started with so you can see what it

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:34,800
feels like to actually add commerce to a

00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:36,060
website next what you could do now

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,710
saying you have to if you're not

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,780
familiar with this it's okay we're going

00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,430
to be doing this all on the screen but

00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:46,770
if you want to follow along at home and

00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:50,280
you have the brush ARB this this example

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:53,700
is good for our i think it's called the

00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:57,090
book pal export the dress I RB will take

00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,490
that file and will actually create if

00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:02,190
you give it the right path name for your

00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,320
database will actually create an up and

00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,450
running site on your system and about

00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,340
two minutes without you have to do

00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,610
anything if you're unfamiliar with drush

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:15,090
and you're unfamiliar with what a a ARR

00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:17,310
or ARB is that's okay because we've also

00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,950
provided in that file if you just open

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:22,770
it up it's a tarball it actually has the

00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:25,140
site files and an export of the database

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,450
so if you're just familiar with

00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,530
databases you can do this later also

00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,400
we've been informed this has been

00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,919
recorded

00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,870
it's being recorded right now so maybe

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:39,630
follow along now and go home and do this

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:43,169
as an example later on the next slide we

00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:47,220
have drush make again with the book pal

00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:48,600
version we have a makefile where and

00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,130
this is a best practice and were going

00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,699
to get into some best practices before

00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:55,259
we actually jump into the demos and what

00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:59,220
you can do is you can run ad rush mate

00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:01,410
command on the make file and it will

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,740
download all the modules to your system

00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:06,180
and set you up with a site that could

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,400
actually do this with all the commerce

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,650
modules and all the dependencies that

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,600
we're going to be using it's also a good

00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:14,280
self documenting thing if you're looking

00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,389
for which modules we used it's all in

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:21,449
that make file so as we're going over

00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:25,080
the best practices try to use this time

00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:27,750
to maybe grab a copy of the site get it

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,699
up and set up on your system since it is

00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,410
a lab we're trying to get you guys to

00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,500
work through this as well with us and

00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:36,750
like Josh was saying if you can't this

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,150
is being recorded and likely there will

00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,610
be there will be blog posts that follow

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,440
after drupalcon that will go into a

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,780
little more detail about the specific

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,240
instructions but if you've got a laptop

00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,979
and you want to follow along go ahead

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,659
and and while we go through the best

00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:55,110
practices go ahead and set it up

00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:56,280
otherwise don't worry about it we're

00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,710
going to take you start to finish

00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:03,479
through that it'll be recorded and it'll

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:06,930
be available to everyone show of hands

00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:11,010
can everybody hear us yes in the back

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:17,159
okay so let's talk about some best

00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:20,690
practices so first and foremost you want

00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:26,099
to do yourself a favor and plan ahead

00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:28,800
commerce is a in itself it's his own

00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:31,620
ecosystem of modules and there are a lot

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,070
of ways that you can get things done and

00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,979
there are in some cases multiple ways to

00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:40,229
do certain things even in this

00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,390
particular demo we've chosen certain

00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:44,360
paths of things

00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:47,690
in order to come to a specific

00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,990
conclusion generally speaking this is

00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,700
not the only way to do it however it is

00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,010
the way that we've chosen to do it and

00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,750
it's a way that if you are looking to

00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:59,660
get started is a way for you to get

00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,460
started and it's not it not considered a

00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:05,510
hack it's just it's just one way of

00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:07,100
doing something but so in terms of in

00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,350
terms of actually planning ahead that's

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,640
doing things like reading documentation

00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:15,080
of modules looking at the issue queue

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,760
getting getting comfortable with what a

00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:22,130
module does and what your particular

00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:24,050
need case is and and then actually you

00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,550
know solidifying in your mind knowing

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:30,710
what you want to do and knowing what

00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:33,350
your final goal is another really great

00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:37,250
thing is do not do anything in

00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:39,260
production just just don't do it you're

00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,990
not the most interesting man in the

00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:45,470
world and if you are then the slide does

00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:47,960
not apply to you but if you are not then

00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,960
go ahead and make a copy of everything

00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,640
which is actually the next slide make a

00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,940
copy of your database make a copy of

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,190
your site play around with it don't be

00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,200
afraid if you backup your stuff if

00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:02,270
you're utilizing a copy of your of your

00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,040
code then the worst thing that may

00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:09,650
happen is you have to go back restore

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:12,050
from it back up and try again which

00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,730
leads into the next one use git I know

00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:15,880
this sounds like a best practice and

00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:19,730
there are probably people going whoa duh

00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:22,220
but we still run into people who don't

00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:25,880
use get don't use some sort of a source

00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:28,790
code version control system at a minimum

00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:34,180
learn how to use get and use get it will

00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:38,060
save you time and frustration and hair

00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:40,550
again backup your stuff there are a

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:43,970
couple of great modules out there one

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:46,520
called demo which is if you're really

00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,710
just wanting to do it and on a local

00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:52,310
machine there's a demo it's just if you

00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,450
go to DG o dot t 0 / demo there's a

00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,190
module we have to download the dev

00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,140
version but it will allow you to

00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:00,050
make database snapshots so you can

00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:03,440
actually move all your modules in and

00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:06,170
test configuration capture the database

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,120
and then try it again over and over

00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:14,620
reverting back to the database and

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:17,420
trying things over again and probably

00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,610
one of the biggest things is not to over

00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,620
complicate things like I said earlier

00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:24,500
there's a lot of ways you can do things

00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:27,380
and in many cases each have their own

00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,060
pros and cons but you don't have to over

00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:32,390
complicate things and I can't stress

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:34,550
this enough yes there are probably you

00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,710
know three modules that will make a

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:39,620
really fancy way of accomplishing one

00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:41,210
particular task do you need those three

00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,070
modules do you need to expend the

00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:46,220
potentially hours trying to you know

00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:48,740
figure out how those work and all those

00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,240
types of things probably not if you're

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,280
if you're just trying to get commerce

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,600
going on a site and and for a lot of

00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,340
folks that's what they want to do they

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,260
just want to get commerce going and they

00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,450
want to be able to iterate quickly they

00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:02,240
want to be able to try things out don't

00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,880
over complicate things you don't need

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,800
everything and all you need is really

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:12,460
something that that is functional and

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:15,920
works as Josh mentioned also there are

00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:18,350
some best practices that are being

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,750
documented as far as not even just

00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:23,690
Drupal commerce but Drupal in general

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:25,960
things like utilizing make files which

00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:28,210
are really great ways of capturing

00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,530
groups of modules that need to be

00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:32,930
enacted on a site in fact if you've used

00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:35,450
commerce kickstart kicks to commerce

00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:37,220
kickstart at its core is as an

00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,080
installation profile but it's built from

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,970
a make file and it makes things a lot

00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,950
simpler and we really encourage you if

00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,740
you haven't started using make files

00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:47,960
they're a really great way to to

00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,550
jumpstart the building of any site

00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,890
because you have all of your standard

00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:55,390
modules there you can pull and git

00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:58,570
repositories all that kind of stuff but

00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,570
definitely do that

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:06,180
so now without any further ado we're

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,910
going to turn it over to mr. Josh over

00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:18,029
here and josh is going to run you

00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:19,410
through the publisher site everybody so

00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:22,680
can you guys see my screen because I

00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:27,480
actually can't should see it some slides

00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:29,670
there so the first demo that we're going

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,040
to do today is called buying books and

00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:35,730
I'm going to take you through looking at

00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,620
a publisher site it's a fantasy side but

00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,990
a publisher site that has a listing of

00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,329
books and a listing of events and we're

00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:45,509
going to first show you how you can

00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:48,750
easily install commerce and then start

00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:52,290
buying books within about 10 minutes and

00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:55,019
then our next demo is going to be event

00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:58,470
registration an event registration we're

00:13:55,019 --> 00:14:00,060
going to do the same kind of thing but

00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,920
we're going to set it up so that you can

00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:05,490
actually register for say a book signing

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:08,459
for this publisher site so for the first

00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:11,550
demo we're going to follow best

00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:15,269
practices what you see right here is an

00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:17,300
impromptu demo of commerce skies new

00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:19,920
hosting service called platform

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,860
platforms similar to Pantheon or aqua ax

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:27,540
and that you can do a dev site a test

00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:29,850
site staging site and a live site what

00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:33,300
we've done to kind of turn it on its

00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:35,610
head is you can do hierarchical copies

00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:38,339
of your site so what we have right here

00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:41,579
is a master environment and i'm going to

00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:43,980
add commerce to our site so I've created

00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:46,259
a branch which is very easy to do with

00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,959
with the platform you simply click the

00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:50,850
branch button give it a name push the

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,519
button and it makes a complete copy of

00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:55,680
your site and it's not just the database

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,750
and the files it's also making a copy of

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,850
the solar server that's running the

00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:02,430
backend the reddest server that's

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:06,059
handling the caching all of that which

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:06,899
allows you to quickly make a copy which

00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:09,029
is what we're talking about best

00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:10,319
practices I think sometimes the reason

00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:11,670
best practices aren't followed is

00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:15,990
because they're hard to do

00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:17,820
this makes it really easy to do so for

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,980
every branch you get a link up here

00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,840
called view this website so that's the

00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,440
Masters the live site commerce is the

00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:27,780
one we're going to be playing with today

00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:30,510
this is our first example site it's a

00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:32,550
publisher called book pal I believe

00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,560
Nick's daughter actually put all the

00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:36,150
books and for this so I think that was a

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,810
punishment which I don't know how happy

00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:43,170
about that but we have a bunch of books

00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:46,910
listed here you can use the filters to

00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:49,770
find various kinds of books the

00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,780
availability Drupal we're using vuze to

00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:54,330
do this and we're using actually we're

00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:56,970
actually using vuze here to create kind

00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:59,970
of a menu where you can facet down into

00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:02,280
this catalog now the publisher that

00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:04,380
built this site basically was just

00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,200
trying to show off a catalog of products

00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,060
that they have and they expected you to

00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,700
phone call in and order something or

00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,740
maybe go to amazon and buy it but they

00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,510
really would prefer if you could just

00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,300
click add to cart and purchase these

00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:20,880
things now this is a pretty common

00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,220
example and it's a pretty simple example

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,830
of how commercial work so the first

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:29,460
thing we need to do is we can click

00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:34,050
login and once we've logged in with the

00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:35,820
right password ah yes if you actually

00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:40,170
have it up and running that was a test

00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:42,240
to see it's admin admin which I did that

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:46,200
so that I could say that is not a best

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:50,700
practice never named your site admin

00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:53,250
admin okay so once you've logged in

00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,490
you've got the website here and what we

00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:58,470
need to do first and I'm going to keep

00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:00,360
referencing my notes partially for your

00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,710
benefit partially for mine because I've

00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,990
done this enough that I'm going to

00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:06,120
forget a step so the first thing we need

00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:10,140
to do is install all of commerce and its

00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:12,420
dependencies so it's just a typical

00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,760
Drupal site and and I think commerce

00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:17,490
sometimes in our minds because it's

00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,800
changing the way our website works it's

00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,420
no longer putting up dynamic content

00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,760
it's actually allowing people to buy

00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,329
stuff it kind of feels magical in a way

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,960
like we're worried about install

00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:31,360
commerce on an actual site but for for

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,970
our purposes basically we're just going

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,220
to enable all the commerce modules now I

00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,380
went through this a couple times when I

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,760
was planning for this and I was kind of

00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,799
impressed because I always start with

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,559
kickstart one I never actually have to

00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:46,919
click all these each one of these

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,850
modules that commerce comes with is

00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:50,320
encapsulated and a couple of them are

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,140
dependent on each other but not very

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:58,179
many they also have user interfaces

00:17:53,140 --> 00:18:00,659
which means by default commerce can be

00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:02,769
as little or as much as you want it and

00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:05,110
for this demo site we're going to go

00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:06,580
ahead and turn all of the core commerce

00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:11,380
modules on which means we're going to be

00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:13,480
clicking for a fair bet okay once we've

00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,760
done that there are two other modules

00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,309
that I did not click as dependencies on

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,440
here because commerce already requires

00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:24,940
them and we're going to be using Drupal

00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:27,760
and help drupal helps us oftentimes when

00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:29,620
we most need it and this is the same

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,590
this is no exception we have rules and

00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,750
rules UI which is used for pricing and

00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:37,149
taxes and we have the address field

00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:39,639
which is used for apparently the payment

00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:42,490
you I but also customer address fielding

00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:47,320
a number of other places so we're going

00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:49,929
to click continue and as this is loading

00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,210
because enabling a number of modules can

00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:54,519
be slow at times plus word depending on

00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:57,399
the internet right now which thankfully

00:18:54,519 --> 00:19:00,370
for this conference is doing well we

00:18:57,399 --> 00:19:03,519
have what's going through here is it's

00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:07,330
adding commerce it's adding payment ap

00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:09,450
is and it's going to add absolutely

00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:12,159
nothing to the front end of your website

00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:15,010
so even if you were to have commerce

00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:16,779
installed on a site ahead of time it's

00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:19,960
not necessarily going to change the

00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:23,080
front end at all once it's loaded you

00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,330
get if you're using admin menu a new

00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,580
menu item here at the top called store

00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,830
and it gives you access to all the

00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:34,200
customer profiles it gives you access to

00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:37,389
orders products and store configuration

00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,950
so we've got the modules just simply

00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:41,170
commerce installed

00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,820
the next thing we need to do is we're

00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:45,280
going to make the first product type

00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,810
that it comes out of the box with we're

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,900
going to kind of change it so it helps

00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:52,990
our store administrators so for the

00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:55,690
product type product we're going to

00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:57,520
click that and it's going to give us

00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,200
just a really quick thing if you're used

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,710
to content types this is the same thing

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,200
i'm going to call this a book because we

00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:08,230
are selling books on this site so I'm

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:15,880
gonna save product type and we have a

00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:25,420
fantastic error cool the demo gods are

00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:31,060
unhappy with us view this website on

00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:34,360
this one cool so I'm going to since we

00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:36,610
have a backup of the site I'm going to

00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:40,630
do it live as Ryan's Rama likes to put

00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:48,340
it we're going to do this same step real

00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:51,130
quick again on the live site yeah best

00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,630
practices people i'm i'm a shining

00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:56,950
example of what you should not do right

00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:58,480
now josh is a trained professional i

00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,510
don't do this at home don't do this oh

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:05,440
yeah really this should be this should

00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:09,670
be safe to do on any site and don't tell

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,380
them that wanted one of the one of the

00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,850
things that i would do normally to make

00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:16,960
my life a little easier as i would used

00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:19,780
rush enable and have a couple of modules

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:24,700
picked out and just type it so same

00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:27,990
thing that's happening here what we're

00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:32,410
going to do next is we're going to add a

00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:34,930
field to our content type and this is

00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:37,300
this is classic commerce so what you do

00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:38,830
is you add a reference field to your

00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,170
content type so that you can add

00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,300
products to those book pages that we

00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:44,800
were looking at earlier so basically

00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,660
what you want to do I'm just trying to

00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,090
help you get in the mind of what we're

00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,150
trying to add to the site we want to add

00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:53,300
and add

00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:55,190
cart button to a book page so to do that

00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:58,220
we're going to add a field to a book

00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:02,930
page that references products that you

00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:05,120
can add to your cart okay so quickly

00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:07,370
going to change my product type let's

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,640
see if this produces the same error I

00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:21,020
sure hope not click Edit i'm going to

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:24,380
call it book save cool so we now have a

00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,730
book product before we go in add that

00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:29,060
field i was talking about i want to go

00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:31,100
ahead and add a quick product so we have

00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:33,290
a number of books on this side we have

00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,720
about 70 or so but the one that I'm

00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:42,070
interested in is the one by Mike

00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:45,080
Crittenden he recently released a book

00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:47,000
called responsive theming for Drupal and

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,130
it's a fantastic read you guys should

00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,640
pick that up i think it's published by

00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:55,280
o'reilly and save that product so we now

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,520
have a product in commerce that's on

00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,590
this publisher site and that took maybe

00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:04,010
three minutes if you take out the cool

00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:05,600
error that i just found randomly so we

00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:07,130
have a product but how do you sell it

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,990
how do you view it in fact because if

00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:11,540
you click the title it takes you to the

00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:17,270
edit page so what you do to view it is

00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:19,670
you go and add a field to the content

00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:21,650
type that you want that cart button to

00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:24,800
show up on it's going to be really easy

00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:27,470
we're just going to call it buy this

00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,570
book and it's going to be one of these

00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,100
amazing fields that we have here it's

00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:35,600
called the product reference field it

00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:38,330
comes default with commerce select list

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,200
is fine there's a number of for matters

00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,940
that are out there if you've used

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,190
kickstart to I saw a number of hands go

00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:45,350
up it uses the formatter called inline

00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:49,250
entity field which lets you edit the

00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:50,690
products in the page when you're adding

00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,520
a reference field you want to make sure

00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,810
you have render fields from this

00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,940
reference product when viewing this

00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:58,880
entity which is a really fancy way of

00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:03,290
saying I want the price to show up when

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:07,250
I look at this this particular node

00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:09,350
click Save all right now our tree the

00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:11,900
trick is now we just need to connect a

00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:16,510
product with a book so that we can buy

00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:19,670
the book so we get to find the book that

00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:22,340
Mike created I know it was a theming

00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:24,380
book it's called responsive theming for

00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:27,740
Drupal and we're going to go ahead and

00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:30,860
click Edit so this is just a standard

00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:32,420
note page and we added one field at the

00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,720
bottom here it's called buy this book

00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:37,910
and we've selected a product to buy the

00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,440
book now when I click Save one of the

00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:42,830
things that's cool about this kind of

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,230
fantasy site is we're running panels so

00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:47,060
we have total control over what's

00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:49,550
actually happening here we can do some

00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,810
cool stuff like add reviews 5 star

00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:52,580
reviews that kind of thing that's

00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:54,590
something the publisher is already

00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:58,070
figured out and got it working for us

00:24:54,590 --> 00:25:01,730
but how do you add commerce to a panel

00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:05,930
controlled page it's very simple you

00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:10,100
just click Edit panel and then we add a

00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:12,440
field like any other field to our panel

00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,990
page so I want to have the add to cart

00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,720
button show up on the sidebar of this

00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:21,380
page so I'm going to click add content

00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,570
and under node we have all of the fields

00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,070
that you could possibly add here the one

00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:27,920
we're looking for is called buy this

00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,090
book that's the add to cart button that

00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:33,380
we're looking for so I'm going to go

00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:35,090
ahead and click that and we're going to

00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,980
eat you can select a format or the one

00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:40,100
that's default is the one you want add

00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:43,760
to cart click continue and I'm just

00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:45,890
going to go ahead and click finish so if

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,260
I just update and save this right now

00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:50,750
it'll take us back to the page and I can

00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:52,490
add this to the cart but we're missing a

00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:55,970
few things for example we don't have a

00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:58,580
price so to show a price you can go back

00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,770
in there repeat the same steps just by

00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:05,330
adding another field and go into node

00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:07,880
and you want to add product price you

00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:09,530
could also show off the SKU you could

00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,840
have fields attached to this product

00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:13,730
like different images so that when they

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,680
choose various attributes like if

00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,000
they're going to choose hardback or

00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,820
paper

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,270
back or ebook it would load all the

00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:27,070
various attribute fields so we're going

00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:31,150
to select price click finish I'm going

00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:33,490
to do one quick thing I'd we're using

00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:34,930
the bootstrap theme here and one of the

00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:36,730
things you can do with bootstrap that

00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:39,400
I've just absolutely fallen in love with

00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:42,370
is you can use classes that come

00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:44,470
straight out of bootstrap to kind of

00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:45,940
design in the interface so I'm making

00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:49,510
I'm going to make this look like a well

00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:52,480
and bootstrap 3 i'm making it a lead so

00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:54,820
it makes the text a little bit bigger

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,130
and i'm also making it green by telling

00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:01,450
it that it's successful so you click

00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:04,810
Save update and save again and we now

00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:06,700
have an add to cart and a price field so

00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:09,250
just to show that off we can go ahead

00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,900
and click Add to Cart it's been added to

00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:13,840
my car I don't see it over here there's

00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:17,140
no cart block so should you want to add

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:21,490
a card block to your site you can go to

00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:23,860
your blocks like any other website demo

00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:26,080
I'm looking for the shopping cart right

00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:29,800
there I'm going to put it in the primary

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:33,280
sidebar click Save what that'll do for

00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:35,440
us is on pages that have a sidebar it'll

00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,780
now bring in our shopping cart and the

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,780
stuff that's been added and to complete

00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:42,880
the full round demo you can actually go

00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:49,140
through checkout I'm going to fill this

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:51,640
out with my fake address next step it's

00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:53,680
the example payments already filled in

00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,240
the payment information and this might

00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:58,270
be a big question for you guys how do

00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:00,460
you take payment on a website and there

00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:03,010
are tons and tons of payment gateways

00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:04,900
out there and there are a number of

00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:08,490
payment gateways that we recommend on

00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:11,800
drupal commerce org paypal's one of them

00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:13,840
pay mill stripes a good one there's

00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,430
there's just a number of various payment

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,730
gateways and you kind of need to pick

00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:20,230
one that works for your use case for my

00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:23,740
use case the example payment works

00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:26,050
really well ok so I have just ordered a

00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:29,049
book and it only took just a few minutes

00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:31,739
to do the next demo

00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:35,919
and I just got the email oh did you also

00:28:31,739 --> 00:28:39,100
I didn't it's oh it's the order

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:42,220
completion email cool let's see here

00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:44,649
present okay so the next demo is going

00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,779
to be event registration an event

00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:49,659
registration on this website we are

00:28:46,779 --> 00:28:51,809
actually allowing people to view all the

00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:54,879
book signing events that are happening

00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:58,330
recently and upcoming well and the

00:28:54,879 --> 00:29:01,239
before we go on with that Oh any busting

00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:03,039
any questions so that was that was a lot

00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:06,489
and I think there's a microphone over

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:09,070
here I don't ya just one microphone over

00:29:06,489 --> 00:29:21,580
here go ahead well we'll repeat the

00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:23,499
question right yeah oh okay so how do

00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:36,999
you download this version is that what

00:29:23,499 --> 00:29:39,369
you're asking oh right so if right right

00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:41,859
so what this should be is an exact copy

00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:43,539
of what I was doing with originally so

00:29:41,859 --> 00:29:45,970
my guess is the error wasn't actually

00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:48,700
with the files it was with the actual

00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:52,690
server that had been spun up for that

00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:54,340
particular time you should be able to

00:29:52,690 --> 00:30:00,009
follow along with me unless you have the

00:29:54,340 --> 00:30:02,679
same did you have the same error oh did

00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:05,919
you really cool so that means it's

00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:08,019
actually on the site we will be posting

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:14,019
an updated set of files so you guys can

00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:18,639
follow along at home I it would be in go

00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:20,529
ahead by the way right before that error

00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:23,980
there was a small line at the bottom

00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:26,559
about rules and also maybe was installed

00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:28,570
could you just you keep using the word

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,559
commerce and commerce kickstart like

00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,999
sort of i don't know if it's

00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:33,039
interchangeable could you tell me the

00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:34,840
difference between those okay yes it's

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:37,929
just one a grouping of the modules and

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:40,960
yeah it's a good question if you guys

00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:41,320
are familiar with a Drupal is kind of a

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,419
frame

00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,389
mark and it has modules and themes and

00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:49,000
one of the ways you can access Drupal

00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:51,909
and get started with it is with a thing

00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,740
called distributions and commerce

00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:55,600
kickstart is a distribution which is

00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:58,389
just a collection of modules and a theme

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,889
and it usually has an installation

00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:04,059
profile that kind of sets it up with an

00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:06,100
example content so kick start to is did

00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:09,519
you switch the yes okay so what you're

00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:11,919
seeing right now is the module page for

00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,799
kick-start to and that comes with a

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:17,590
bunch of example content a great setup

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:20,799
for your administrative interface etc

00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:23,350
it's it's really designed to show kind

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:29,919
of the potential that commerce has now

00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:32,559
drupal commerce itself oops is just a

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,710
series of modules so commerce kickstart

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:37,509
is kind of a a use case for commerce

00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:40,720
where you have a theme sample content

00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:42,429
that type of stuff shows you a lot of

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,620
configuration you know kind of how to

00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:47,139
configuration stuff drupal commerce

00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:48,669
would be kind of the approach if you

00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:50,259
have an existing site and you're wanting

00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:53,320
to implement something with commerce on

00:31:50,259 --> 00:31:55,450
top of it the commerce core modules are

00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,309
what what you would start with it's a

00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:59,620
good points we're at each one of our

00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:00,879
demos is all about adding commerce to a

00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,129
site you can't start with the

00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:04,629
distribution so that's why we're going

00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:07,990
through and literally clicking all the

00:32:04,629 --> 00:32:10,600
checkboxes on all the modules okay any

00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:14,950
other questions or okay come on up to

00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:18,909
the mic and if you've got a one might as

00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:20,679
well queue behind her say okay so you

00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:23,279
have your product that's a physical

00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:27,309
product of the book what if you had a

00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:29,980
ebook of the same content so it could be

00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:31,990
email or it could be downloaded or it

00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,730
could be mailed would that be an

00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:35,889
attribute or would you set up a new

00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:38,080
product for that it could be an

00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:39,429
attribute but you'd probably want to set

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,110
up a different kind of product type and

00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:46,210
then have a field of some sort to write

00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:48,610
what you would do the way commerce works

00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:51,490
when you use multiple product types on a

00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:53,440
product display so let's say you have a

00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,850
product type called ebook that's

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,680
actually five

00:32:54,850 --> 00:33:01,240
and it's managed by commerce file so you

00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,770
in commerce license and all that if you

00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,950
had that that would be one product type

00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:08,980
and maybe a physical product type called

00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:11,140
book right and they're both displayed on

00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:12,520
this page what commerce will do because

00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:16,150
they can't understand attributes that

00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:18,370
way it'll give you a list of the the

00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:23,590
various products and yeah and so you

00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:26,830
would just select the e-book any other

00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:27,970
questions using the example you're

00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:30,190
showing here with the books already

00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:33,100
existing is it possible to make this

00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:35,470
skew an already existing field or would

00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:38,620
you in this example have to go through

00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:40,240
each book and say as you're creating

00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:43,270
products you will have to fill in the

00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,730
skew there are ways to automate existing

00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:47,860
content which is something that would be

00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:51,430
a really cool lab where we talk about

00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:52,960
migrate or we talk about just simply

00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:55,810
running some custom scripts that would

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:59,050
copy field data over from one content to

00:33:55,810 --> 00:34:00,310
the other but the the real trick is at

00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:03,520
least for our examples we're just

00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:05,650
creating products from scratch it would

00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:08,830
even be possible with rules and views

00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:12,730
bulk operation to be able to create a

00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:16,180
product and then copy a field Boyan

00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:18,430
looks up at me because it's it's a

00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:19,870
little strange but it does work you

00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:24,340
could you could automate stuff like that

00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:26,020
with rules and PPO and auto skew yeah an

00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:27,190
auto skew yeah alright we're going to do

00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,050
one more and then we're going to keep

00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:31,840
going to cook come on how well does

00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:35,380
commerce do with you know multiple

00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:37,390
vendors so something like an EDC or an

00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:40,510
Amazon where you're buying this product

00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:42,340
from seller a and you know these three

00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:44,350
products from seller be and it's all one

00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:49,510
order but different people are getting

00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:51,370
paid so commerce out of the box there's

00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:54,820
actually a module called commerce

00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:57,670
marketplace and there's there actually I

00:34:54,820 --> 00:35:00,190
take that back there are two one written

00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:03,970
by a guy named Farhad and a one that is

00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:05,310
a sandbox written by ma chick who's a

00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:08,340
Commerce guy

00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:14,370
the matcha installation that the sandbox

00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:16,350
that's available and I'm see it's anyway

00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:19,620
right over here there is a there's this

00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:21,270
there's this sandbox but but it can

00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,860
accommodate that need and that would be

00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:25,320
something that if you want more

00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:27,540
information on that just come come talk

00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:31,640
to either either this guy over here or

00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:31,640
myself afterwards and we'd be happy to

00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:39,990
at the yeah the etsy etsy situation can

00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:42,360
take some thinking through because for

00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:44,670
example you have to split payment and

00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,140
there's ways to do that with you always

00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:53,640
do that with commerce funds and so forth

00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:55,320
okay sure it's called it's called

00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,170
platform and if you want to learn more

00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:01,590
about it it's called platform SH is the

00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:03,680
website and you can fill out a form

00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:06,390
there and request some more information

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,030
all right back to you alright so I guess

00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:11,190
my screen again okay alright so our

00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:13,800
second demo is going to be event

00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,180
registration and we find ourselves again

00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,300
on the module page because we need to

00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:19,440
enable just a couple more modules and

00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,790
let's see let's make sure I've got it

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,220
right here we've got we're going to

00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:24,390
enable the stock module for commerce so

00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,100
that we can keep track of how many

00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:28,590
tickets are left for this event and

00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:31,110
we're going to enable commerce

00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:33,900
customizable products and that's going

00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:35,280
to allow us to create fields that the

00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,790
customer fills out when they add

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:43,560
something to cart okay so let's get

00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:45,930
going to install commerce stock you once

00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,030
you've downloaded it and put commerce

00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:50,700
stock module in your site you'll see a

00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:51,960
number of various options the one we're

00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,090
going to want to do is called simple

00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:57,330
stock and I'm going to enable simple

00:36:54,090 --> 00:37:00,630
stock rules the stock API and I'm in

00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:04,050
stock UI let's see what was the other

00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:06,990
one it was customizable so it's under

00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:09,240
commerce contribs to myzel products is

00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:11,370
really cool it allows you to treat line

00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,730
items like content types and product

00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:17,160
types where you can create a brand new

00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:18,700
line of brand new line item type now you

00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:22,390
might be sitting here thinking like what

00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:24,250
acts line item type it is shipping is a

00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:26,170
line item type so if you create an order

00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:29,260
and you add something that has a price

00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:32,099
to an order it is definitely some type

00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:36,220
of line item so shipping is an example

00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:37,839
discounts an example product is an

00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:40,480
example so we're going to create a

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,609
custom line item type that has a bunch

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,010
of information that's stored directly on

00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:47,109
the order and the idea behind that is

00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:48,700
like let's say you're buying an iphone

00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:52,150
from apple and you want to engrave your

00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:54,520
name on it that's not a specific skewed

00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:56,680
product your name is not something that

00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:59,290
makes that product unique your name is

00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,490
what makes it unique for that order so

00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:03,640
you would want to store that information

00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:08,200
on the order so now that the modules are

00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:12,010
enabled it's called commerce

00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:14,320
customizable products yeah awesome name

00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:15,790
okay so our next step is to create a new

00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,190
product type we're going to call this

00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:21,339
event tickets so we're going to start

00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:22,990
selling event tickets on our site and to

00:38:21,339 --> 00:38:24,880
create a product types very similar to

00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:26,740
renaming one you just go to product

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:31,510
types add product type and we're going

00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:36,339
to call it event tickets and we're going

00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:38,890
to save product type we next are going

00:38:36,339 --> 00:38:44,260
to configure the stock module so that it

00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:46,599
can track the events ticket purchases so

00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:50,170
you go into store under configuration

00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:53,109
and it's under stock management and it's

00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:56,380
since you have simple stock enabled it's

00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:58,869
simply telling stock which content types

00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:00,609
that wants to track or which product

00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:02,650
types it wants to track and what it's

00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:05,890
going to do and I click Submit is it's

00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:09,250
going to add a field that the rules that

00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:11,050
it came bundled with understands which

00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:13,869
will block the purchase of this product

00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:16,750
once the tickets are sold out so once

00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:20,640
we've enabled it for the event tickets

00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:23,050
we can go back to our event ticket

00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,839
product type and look at the fields and

00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:28,210
we have a new field on here called stock

00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:32,100
and I'm going to go ahead and change

00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:34,090
this to available tickets

00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,590
available tickets kind of helps the

00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:37,720
store administrator understand what

00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:39,520
stock means in this case and it will

00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:43,560
also help us in the interface once we

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:46,180
start taking orders for tech for tickets

00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:49,480
okay now that we've got simple stock

00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:53,080
configured we're going to create an

00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:55,110
event ticket now continuing on with my

00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:58,060
love for my crittenden in all things

00:39:55,110 --> 00:40:01,330
responsive theming we are going to

00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:03,130
create a product and now this time if I

00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:04,720
click add a product I know have two

00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:07,330
kinds of products i can create on this

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,270
site that just 20 minutes ago was not

00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:15,930
having any kind of products at all so

00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:21,940
i'm going to call this responsive to and

00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:24,580
buy a book by a signed book from mike

00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:27,610
and we're going to make this thing

00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:29,230
slightly more expensive and we're going

00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:32,050
to say that there's only 60 of these

00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:35,380
available we're going to just click Save

00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:37,630
product once we've done that you're now

00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,370
going to we have two products we have by

00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:41,530
a signed book for Mike which is a set of

00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:44,470
event tickets and we have responsive

00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:46,990
theming was an actual book the next step

00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:49,990
if you recall when we were adding books

00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:52,570
was to add a product reference field to

00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:53,950
our content type now to look at these

00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:55,240
real quick because we're kind of in the

00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:58,270
back end I want to show you the front

00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,800
end again we have a book listing of

00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:02,170
course and you go in here and you look

00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:05,080
at the book listing and you'll see

00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:07,480
content etc you can also look at the

00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,280
meet the author section which has a

00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,960
couple of authors that are going to be

00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,260
at drupalcon and they're signing books

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,270
and you should go and buy those so when

00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:19,030
you go and look at this book signing

00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:20,350
event that's what it looks like even we

00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:23,140
even have a listing here showing the

00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:25,840
books by the author so what we need to

00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:28,090
do is get an add to cart button to show

00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:32,140
up on this event page so that they can

00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:34,030
register for the event to do that we go

00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:36,520
into content types this particular

00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:37,990
content types called event and we're

00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:41,380
going to add a product reference field

00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:43,780
and I have names for these so that they

00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:50,320
make sense later on so we're going to

00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:51,670
call it ticket okay and the product

00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,960
reference fields same kind of reference

00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:55,690
field we had before i'm just going to

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:59,620
use a select list again kickstart to

00:41:55,690 --> 00:42:01,690
uses in line entity there are other

00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:03,910
kinds you could do an autocomplete

00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:06,940
that's what kickstart one comes with by

00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:08,770
default let's see here or anything i'm

00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:11,020
missing we want only event tickets to

00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:15,400
show up and we do want the price field

00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:18,310
to show up click Save okay so what I've

00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:23,170
done now is I've made it possible for

00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:25,240
you to add an event registration to the

00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:28,420
actual event so if i go to meet the

00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:33,910
authors mike Crittenden and i click Edit

00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:35,830
i can now go here and select a set of

00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:39,790
tickets that are available for this

00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:41,560
particular event click Save now again

00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:43,630
we're using panels so it's not going to

00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,940
show up right away and that's fine

00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:47,770
because we actually haven't set up the

00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:49,930
registration portion of this yet because

00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:52,270
so far we've just redone exactly what we

00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:55,680
did the last time to set up the event

00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:58,780
portion we want to go into the

00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,850
configuration under store and go under

00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:02,290
light item types so we have one line

00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:04,120
item type that comes with commerce by

00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:05,920
default called product if you have

00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:08,110
shipping you would also have a shipping

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,330
line item etc so we're going to go ahead

00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:15,550
and add a product line item type and

00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:19,450
we're going to call these event

00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:22,030
registration now if this is a little

00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:23,740
confusing the line item types there's

00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:25,590
actually if you go to Drupal commerce or

00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:28,270
there is a user guide under

00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:30,430
documentation and there are a couple of

00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:32,860
really great pages under the user guide

00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:35,080
that talk about the relationship of

00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,940
products and line items and it would

00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:39,400
really encourage you if you if you're

00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:40,540
even if you're familiar with commerce

00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,250
and you've used it a little bit before

00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:44,200
but you haven't done say custom line

00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:46,090
items check out the user guide there's

00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,950
some great diagrams that kind of explain

00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:51,790
this a little bit more and can and can

00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:54,540
kind of shed some light on more of the

00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:57,970
details of what's going on under this

00:43:54,540 --> 00:44:01,900
thank you Nick just checking the time

00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:05,380
right now okay good so we are looking at

00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:08,620
a line item type which looks strikingly

00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:11,470
similar to a list of product types and a

00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:13,120
list of content types you have the

00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:17,170
standard managed fields managed display

00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:18,730
etc so for managed fields this is where

00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:20,680
we can add the event registration

00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:23,080
information so pretend this is like a

00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:26,800
web form where you're adding name email

00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:28,420
phone number lunch option because you

00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,680
know at book signings we give you food

00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:34,660
so I'm going to go ahead and had name

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:37,030
just a text field but you could you

00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:39,400
could install any modules you wanted to

00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:42,730
and this so like for example email or a

00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:46,030
phone how whatever you want to collect

00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:47,740
for your event the trick is it's just a

00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:49,930
feel double entity I mean it's that's

00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:51,550
basically all it is the trick is once

00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:53,620
you've added this field if you want it

00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:55,840
to show up when before someone clicks

00:44:53,620 --> 00:45:00,100
add to cart you want to click include

00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:03,550
this field on Add to Cart forms click

00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:06,960
Save I'm going to go ahead and ask for

00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:09,820
their lunch option lunch preference

00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,970
that's what i call it and this for this

00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:20,530
one I'm going to go ahead and use a list

00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:26,410
text field click Save and so for lunch

00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:30,430
we have awesome food and less awesome

00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:32,710
food suppose if you really want less

00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:34,810
awesome food you can i'll leave you to

00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:38,860
judge which exactly kind of food that is

00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:44,860
and we will click again include this on

00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:47,020
the line item click Save okay now now

00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:50,280
that we have the fields for our event

00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:56,380
registration we need to go ahead and add

00:45:50,280 --> 00:46:00,520
that new content new line item type to

00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:06,100
the entity so when we go into content

00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:07,340
types and event managed esplain fault

00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,440
display this is

00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:11,210
I was going through this the first time

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,580
this kind of tripped me up because i was

00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:16,820
using panels and panels circumvents

00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:18,950
these settings but to get the line item

00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:22,880
to actually save you actually have to go

00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:25,160
into these settings I probably file an

00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,370
issue for that when you go to the manage

00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:29,660
display tab of the product type the

00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:32,090
event type of the book type whatever

00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:33,980
you're doing you can click the widget

00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:37,400
next to the product reference field and

00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:38,990
you can choose a line item type so we're

00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:42,680
going to change it to event registration

00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:46,370
and I click update and then I'm going to

00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:49,790
go directly to our event page now the

00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:51,530
event page meet the authors page where

00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:54,980
of course we really want to meet Mike

00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:56,960
we've already added the event to it but

00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:59,560
it's not showing up here yet so we're

00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,840
going to go ahead and click Edit panel

00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:04,040
when we're editing the panel this time

00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,930
I'm going to go ahead and put the

00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:09,350
content in the bigger pain just because

00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:11,180
it just makes sense to me to do that you

00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:13,520
can go to the notes section you can

00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:15,830
choose any of the fields for us we're

00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,110
going to allow them to register for an

00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:20,900
event using tickets so I'm going to

00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:22,550
choose that and select the formatter

00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:26,150
we're going to go Add to Cart we click

00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:28,420
continue and here's the other trick here

00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:31,370
you choose the line item type as well

00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:35,300
event registration and we can click

00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:37,880
finish now since we did this before I

00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:39,760
can skip the Oh where's the price

00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:42,290
question just go ahead and add the price

00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,960
so we're going to go into note again

00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:47,360
there's a product price we're going to

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:50,480
add that and there's another field we

00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:53,420
added to this product and that is the

00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:56,150
stock or the available tickets so if we

00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:58,940
go in here and we had available tickets

00:47:56,150 --> 00:48:02,600
click finish and one of the things you

00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:05,000
get when you do panels as you get a lot

00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,590
more control over how things are

00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,290
displayed pretty easily with

00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:10,910
drag-and-drop and so forth so I'm going

00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:13,610
to go in here real quick I'm going to

00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:18,810
override the title and i'm going to call

00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:24,120
this event registration

00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:25,800
finish and I'm going to turn off the now

00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:29,670
we'll keep the title for price why not

00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:34,580
and the title for tickets okay well

00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:34,580
click update and save so yeah go for it

00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:50,580
yes yeah that that's a it should be a

00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:54,420
vile bug for i'm not sure what it would

00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:56,670
be for me it's necessary if you don't do

00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:58,800
that you can still get to this point and

00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:59,940
start taking the event registrations but

00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,860
it won't save any of the event

00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:03,990
registration information yeah I was like

00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:13,770
why isn't it showing up to more

00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:16,140
questions yeah right if you're using

00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:18,360
displace we it circumvents the display

00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:20,310
no actually it wouldn't would it because

00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:28,190
it's using display modes so you should

00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:28,190
be fine last question yeah yeah

00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:44,569
you could treat those as skews there are

00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,940
lots of other options that you could do

00:49:44,569 --> 00:49:48,680
as well I'm getting I'm getting I'm

00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:54,349
getting one commerce guy up front here

00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:56,210
like you're crazy for saying that get

00:49:54,349 --> 00:49:57,619
back to me on that I'll think through

00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:59,720
that as we're going through the second

00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:02,029
demo see if there's a better way to do

00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:04,660
that for now yeah general admission

00:50:02,029 --> 00:50:08,240
tickets because we're only signing books

00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:10,579
okay so when you've added that to your

00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,980
panel page you now have an event

00:50:10,579 --> 00:50:17,450
registration section the available

00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:20,180
tickets 60.00 and the price is

00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:22,069
twenty-five dollars and here we go i'm

00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:23,839
going to go ahead and sign up for this

00:50:22,069 --> 00:50:26,539
and of course i want the awesome food

00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:30,020
not the less awesome food click Add to

00:50:26,539 --> 00:50:32,119
Cart now once we've added this to a cart

00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:34,730
you can see that i'm buying the ticket

00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:36,920
where I can get a signed book from mike

00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:39,140
and i can show up to this event the

00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,819
trick is you don't really see my name

00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,990
you don't see my lunch preference you

00:50:40,819 --> 00:50:43,940
want to give them this kind of

00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:45,289
information and to just kind of

00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,420
demonstrate what you can do with

00:50:45,289 --> 00:50:50,569
commerce everything in commerce is a

00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:52,730
view and is some sort of entity that's

00:50:50,569 --> 00:50:55,549
feel dab'll so you can actually go into

00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:59,559
your cart and add fields that you've

00:50:55,549 --> 00:51:01,700
added to your line item so for example i

00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:05,329
forget what i called it so i'm just

00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:08,230
going to look through the list the name

00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:12,260
yeah i can just type name yeah thank you

00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:14,930
late night last night it was at lunch as

00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:16,910
well at lunch preference okay so we're

00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:19,130
going to add those two fields to our

00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:21,260
cart which I don't know is if it's

00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:25,970
advisable or not but we'll go for it

00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:27,470
lunch preference and name and since it's

00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:31,160
a table i'm going to go ahead and drop

00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:33,559
all of those new fields into one of the

00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:37,730
columns so lunch preference will go in

00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:42,440
the title column as well as my name so

00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:43,390
click Save or apply and then we'll click

00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,730
Save

00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:48,010
and they should take us back and we

00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:53,279
should see additional information

00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:57,970
showing up we'll try it again real quick

00:51:53,279 --> 00:51:59,619
Josh awesome food at cart it's not

00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:01,690
showing her to the go to the page go to

00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:09,970
the view cart page yeah but I edit it I

00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:13,839
edited the actual so and we are adding

00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:17,260
those yeah so what's happening is this

00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:20,529
is the same bug that I saw before let's

00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:27,430
go into I may have edited the wrong type

00:52:20,529 --> 00:52:30,849
let's go into yeah it is but I typed in

00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:33,640
the same name and lunch preference so

00:52:30,849 --> 00:52:35,349
that potentially could be what's

00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:39,569
happening there but I'm it was a vent

00:52:35,349 --> 00:52:39,569
and we're going in to manage display

00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:47,460
that was the problem I changed the add

00:52:44,349 --> 00:52:51,759
the line item type to the wrong display

00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:53,740
gotta love demos for that reason so

00:52:51,759 --> 00:52:55,299
that's that's a demonstration of the bug

00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:57,970
after we talked about it for like five

00:52:55,299 --> 00:53:00,119
minutes so here we go Mike Crittenden

00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:02,380
i'm going to register for the event

00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:05,589
you're going to see this information

00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:07,480
magically appear on my cart after I

00:53:05,589 --> 00:53:11,259
click Add to Cart there it is awesome

00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:13,869
food and Josh now this is just a demo

00:53:11,259 --> 00:53:16,000
but you can imagine if it were an image

00:53:13,869 --> 00:53:19,180
field that you're asking for people to

00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,759
upload some sort of fancy image or if

00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:23,589
you had a great designer who can fit

00:53:21,759 --> 00:53:25,720
tons of information in a really small

00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:27,730
space there's ways you could do this

00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:31,420
that would make it look a little bit

00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:33,940
nicer but as a demonstration not bad we

00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:38,609
can go ahead and check out for our

00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:41,769
different products click checkout

00:53:38,609 --> 00:53:44,710
without accidentally invoking the swype

00:53:41,769 --> 00:53:47,410
we go backwards and I this is going to

00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:51,460
look exactly the same as it did when we

00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:55,740
were buying the books example payment

00:53:51,460 --> 00:54:02,210
Nick will get an email and that's the

00:53:55,740 --> 00:54:14,280
the event registration for our book site

00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:15,869
do we have any additional questions yeah

00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,850
I don't think that's a problem I'm not

00:54:15,869 --> 00:54:20,100
really sure off the top of my head why

00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:24,600
it has the decimal I'm pretty sure

00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:30,210
that's just a formatter setting yeah can

00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:34,020
I do what oh the new version allows you

00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:36,030
to tweak it so I must be running an on

00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:52,140
dev or non beta or something like that

00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:54,090
ah that's good feedback that's good

00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:55,290
feedback the other the other thing we're

00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:59,640
trying to do is we're trying to fit a

00:54:55,290 --> 00:55:01,410
lot and two hours so unfortunately we

00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:04,010
will try to will try to slow down and

00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:08,760
we'll try to give you guys time to click

00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:10,920
yes sir it's all recorded it'll all be

00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:13,740
on YouTube we're actually youtube has a

00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:16,650
school setting now you can do one and a

00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:19,770
half X or half X so it can you can make

00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:23,550
it last for hours listening listening to

00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:26,420
our awesome voices yes exactly two more

00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:26,420
questions go for it

00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:41,279
okay so how do you set up payment

00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:44,189
basically is your question right right

00:55:41,279 --> 00:55:46,439
so if you were to enable say Express

00:55:44,189 --> 00:55:49,379
Checkout by paypal what you would have

00:55:46,439 --> 00:55:51,299
in the checkout form I'm just going to

00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:56,939
buy a ticket without any lunch

00:55:51,299 --> 00:56:03,749
preference click checkout if if I had a

00:55:56,939 --> 00:56:05,909
Express Checkout I could I was even one

00:56:03,749 --> 00:56:07,469
further out if you had expressed check

00:56:05,909 --> 00:56:10,079
out you could replace these two buttons

00:56:07,469 --> 00:56:12,479
right here where you see our cart with

00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:15,059
Express Checkout by paypal and it would

00:56:12,479 --> 00:56:19,379
literally redirect you to paypal and

00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:23,099
that keeps you in pci compliance bracket

00:56:19,379 --> 00:56:26,729
a and I knew this would come up so if

00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:31,529
you guys are unfamiliar with is a drupal

00:56:26,729 --> 00:56:36,179
pci you get triple drupal pci compliance

00:56:31,529 --> 00:56:38,879
i forget the URL so we're going to have

00:56:36,179 --> 00:56:42,359
google help me out here it's drupal pci

00:56:38,879 --> 00:56:45,299
compliance org and when you're enabling

00:56:42,359 --> 00:56:46,949
various payment gateways you're putting

00:56:45,299 --> 00:56:50,899
your website and the people who buy

00:56:46,949 --> 00:56:53,609
stuff from you at risk and there is a

00:56:50,899 --> 00:56:56,249
standardization on how much risk and

00:56:53,609 --> 00:56:58,679
what that means and and who is actually

00:56:56,249 --> 00:57:01,379
responsible for that risk it's called

00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:03,569
pci compliance this is a great paper

00:57:01,379 --> 00:57:06,119
white paper that walks you through what

00:57:03,569 --> 00:57:08,489
all those mean it even lists the various

00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:10,799
payment gateways for drupal and what

00:57:08,489 --> 00:57:16,139
kinds of risks are associated with that

00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:19,729
so drupal pci compliance stuff org any

00:57:16,139 --> 00:57:19,729
other questions yeah

00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:32,140
once you get the zero uh you could you

00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:36,670
could potentially make a rule that would

00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:38,860
you could change the rule that disables

00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:41,050
the product that's what stock does it

00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:45,090
lets you not buy it but it still shows

00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:49,020
it you could add an action to that to

00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:57,040
unpublish it or to literally disable it

00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:58,600
so that right right it deactivates the

00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,850
product what it what it does is it

00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:03,010
changes the add to cart button to not in

00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:08,110
stock or there's some string that it

00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:10,150
says not available and also if you

00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:12,640
somehow manage to add it to your cart or

00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:14,950
you've added it and you've come back and

00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:18,240
they've run out if you try to check out

00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:23,680
with that it will throw an error as well

00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:25,060
stock module for the win alright be

00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,650
thinking of any other questions you

00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:29,800
might have we're going to take a quick

00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:32,140
break along with everybody else and when

00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:35,680
we get back Nick will walk us through a

00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:40,650
blog selling content and taking

00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,650
