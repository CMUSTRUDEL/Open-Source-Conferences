Publication date: 2014-06-05
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: joshmillernvahalik
In this session, Josh Miller and Nick Vahalik from Commerce Guys will explore adding and configuring commerce on new and existing sites. Designed to be a follow-along lab, we'll have downloadable installs ready for your use so you can participate in all of the excitement. As much as possible, we'll use existing core and contrib modules and keep the coding to a minimum.

IN THIS SESSION WE'LL COVER...

In this example, we take a blog and add the ability to create premium content so that only paid subscribers can get access.

ADDING PRODUCTS TO EXISTING CONTENT PAGES

Have an existing site that you want to utilize for commerce? We'll convert an existing catalog site into an online store.

DONATION SITE

Taking donations is a very common task -- let's make it easy and set it up in a flash.

REGISTRATIONS

Ah, good old registrations. In this demo, we'll setup a site that allows you to offer basic registrations with a couple of options.
