Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: SEMANTIC SITE ARCHITECTURE
Publication date: 2014-06-03
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: Jody Lynn
The architecture decisions behind a site build will determine its maintainability, usability, robustness, and the time it takes to build it.

Every successful Drupal shop has at least one person who possesses the skill to take a complex set of requirements and create a simple and clear architecture plan. But this essential skill is difficult to teach and little discussed, as it requires a great deal of broad Drupal experience, and experience seeing the negative effects of bad architectures. Meanwhile it's easy to get started building complex sites in Drupal with little to no thought toward good architecture, creating a plethora of unmaintainable Franken-sites.

I propose that best practice in Drupal site architecture can be taught, and that its fundamental concepts should be understood by all site builders, themers, and developers. The philosophy that makes for good architecture is based on semantic meaning: the same concept for what makes for good markup, URLs, code, etc.

This session will give you an approach to thinking about architecture decisions: how to name things and how to use things consistently with their names.

A site with good semantic architecture will have little or no need for documentation for its administrators. It will be readily understood and improved by new team members or new teams it meets after you. It is likely to be upgraded and enhanced rather than to be scrapped and replaced by its owners.

I will go through many building block nouns of Drupal (think content types, user roles, Views displays, field formatters, path aliases, menus, image styles, Panels panes, Commerce products) and discuss how they should be named, used, and their common pitfalls.

Nearly all of this session will be useful across major versions of Drupal, focusing its examples on architecture patterns in modules which exist in (or are likely to be ported to) D8.

okay little audience poll stand up if

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,850
you haven't found a seat

00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:00,230
welcome to semantics site architecture

00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:08,640
in semantics site architecture we will

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,340
be talking about how to name things and

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,940
how to think about the way things are

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,490
already named and what the definitions

00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,080
mean in order to make actual

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:26,600
architectures that are easy to

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:29,640
understand that's me i'm jody hamilton i

00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,410
set this up like a dictionary so that we

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,130
can really think about words because i

00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:38,580
think that words are the way that we

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,950
think for many of us and a great way to

00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:44,550
communicate and when you're making

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:48,060
something like an architecture plan it's

00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:51,900
really naming words and definitions that

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:55,550
are the most important on the CT of zip

00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:58,770
tech which is a company in Philadelphia

00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:02,190
I'm a Drupal architect developer site

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:08,550
builder trainer contributor generalist

00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:10,380
and a lot of my work I end up picking up

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,420
and I'm sure it's true for for most

00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,910
people but we spend a lot of time fixing

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:18,150
other people's messes and I think that's

00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:21,330
because it takes a lot more time to fix

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:24,900
a mess than to make a mess so you end up

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,550
in this career where you're fixing

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,090
messes more than you're actually

00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:32,970
building new things and that's sort of

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:36,540
the nature of messes so I start to think

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:39,060
about what are characteristic of these

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:45,450
of these messes of Drupal sites that i

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:49,470
call lemons and what can we take away

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:51,900
from that to teach people to not make

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,209
these messes and I think I found that

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,170
one of the things that really makes for

00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:59,030
a bad Drupal site is when people

00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,720
didn't put a lot of thought into how

00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:06,500
they named things they built things

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:09,920
without thinking about whether those

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:13,840
things had a good name or they build

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:17,360
things that didn't make sense with the

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,400
with the definitions of the words that

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,870
they were using when they built those

00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,010
things and i'm going to give some bunch

00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:27,110
of examples of what i mean by that so

00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:30,050
semantics is a word that gets thrown a

00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:33,590
lot even and reeses talk today he was

00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:37,340
talking about semantic HTML the Semantic

00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:41,120
Web and it's really just it's really

00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:44,540
just a word that means thinking about

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,750
meaning and linguistics and it's just a

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:50,239
way of being more thoughtful in sort of

00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:52,250
any field so I thought we could apply

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,650
this to site architecture and

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,239
site-building because I think site

00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,190
building is something that Drupal makes

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,430
very easy that's the whole idea of

00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:05,900
Drupal is site building is now very easy

00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:08,570
but it doesn't help you to to do it well

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,730
it just makes it fast and easy but the

00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,410
planning part and the thinking part is

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:18,130
still the hard part it doesn't do that

00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:22,130
for you I also have this guy drew flippy

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:23,539
he's if you got a droopy com you can you

00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,030
can download this drew flippy module and

00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:28,940
he will give you my tips while you're

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,950
making your sites so that to remind you

00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,620
to take an extra thought before you just

00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:37,039
fill in those forms and just label

00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,539
things whatever you want so the first

00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:41,330
part of my talk I'm going to talk about

00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:44,840
naming is as site builders is site

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:46,610
architects and a lot of you might be

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,050
site builders that don't have a site our

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:52,550
architect that means that you're the

00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:55,460
site architect you are constantly naming

00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:58,289
things so what kinds of things are

00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:01,800
renaming mmm

00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:04,949
boom content types menus views themes

00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,740
field groups fields image styles modules

00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:10,680
regions etc etc etc you're constantly

00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:16,050
being given this text field where it

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:18,689
says name title label human readable

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:21,599
name machine name what are you putting

00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:23,039
in those fields how much thought are you

00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:29,789
giving to what you're putting in those

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:32,099
skills one thing that's really important

00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:35,939
when you're naming things is consistency

00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:37,379
and this should be pretty I think it's

00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:39,689
very easy to be consistent as long as

00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:41,399
you as long as you know that it's

00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:42,869
important and that naming actually

00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:44,159
matters and that's the main thing that I

00:05:42,869 --> 00:05:46,889
really want to express the peoples that

00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:48,809
naming actually matters it's not just so

00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:52,050
just put anything in that in that label

00:05:48,809 --> 00:05:54,629
and move on with it when I talk about

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,819
consistency in naming it means within

00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:59,580
the category that you're naming and also

00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:03,439
between categories so if you're naming a

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:05,459
content type you want to be consistent

00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:08,669
so that all your names of different

00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:10,409
content types are consistently named but

00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:12,330
you also want to be consistent between

00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:14,909
other parts of your sites so maybe some

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,099
of your views should be using similar

00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:18,779
terms that you're using when you name

00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:20,939
the content types so you want to kind of

00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:22,740
have a vocabulary for your whole site

00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:28,589
that everyone on the project can speak

00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:30,029
clearly some of the ways that droopy

00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:33,809
thinks you should be consistent in

00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:38,819
naming is whether you're being singular

00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:41,309
or plural what's the case spelling

00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:43,860
things consistently correctly is it

00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:46,379
consistently incorrectly using

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,689
punctuation consistently deciding on

00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:50,789
whether you're abbreviating something or

00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:54,749
not abbreviating it and being consistent

00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:57,180
and in all different parts of the Drupal

00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:59,369
interface it's easy to maintain

00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,839
consistency because there are some

00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:03,089
things that are already there out of the

00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:05,279
box so when you're making new content

00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:08,459
type there's already article on page so

00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,379
be consistent with the way those are you

00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:11,700
know what the case is with the singular

00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:18,330
and plural is etc

00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:22,140
that's pretty easy redundancy don't

00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:24,690
bother adding things that don't add any

00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:28,680
meeting right they are just meaningless

00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:30,270
so an example is news a content type for

00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,490
adding news you know sometimes I tell

00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:35,310
people some of my advice for people is

00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,780
always put in that description text when

00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,760
you're adding a content type because

00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,770
that will be consistent all the other

00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,630
ones have description text make sure

00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:45,000
yours does too but that doesn't mean

00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:47,550
just put in some words in there that

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,190
make a description text make sure it has

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:57,120
some actual purpose to it you see this a

00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:59,520
lot people name their theme as like my

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,440
clients name theme and then all the

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,380
functions are like clients name theme

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,870
theme this is that you know or they make

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,730
a link field and they call it link field

00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:12,120
and then you have to like go look up

00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:16,050
data from field data field link field

00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,970
field date or something um you don't

00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,980
that's a call redundancy you don't need

00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:22,890
that when you name things when you named

00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:31,260
your baby you don't name them Tom person

00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:33,240
okay extensibility is something that is

00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,560
a real part of Drupal and it's something

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,130
you have to keep in mind when you're

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,229
naming something sometimes people will

00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,600
name something for what they are

00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:44,760
building right now without remembering

00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,310
that everything really just needs to be

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,860
a bucket where you're going to be adding

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:53,190
more things in the future so this

00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,230
example is that some developer made a

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,570
new module for the ticket that they were

00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,480
signs and their modules name is custom

00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:02,160
staff page filters well great so now

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,690
when we have to add something else to

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,010
the staff page I guess we'll just add

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,770
another how many modules are we going to

00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:11,160
have you know I would Nev that module

00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:13,320
may be staff you know and I could add

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:18,000
everything in there or maybe I would

00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:21,200
call it views extras or something like

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,750
that of course namespace it for your

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:28,590
particular project but

00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:30,870
the idea is be ready to grow an example

00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:34,070
a failing example of this would be the

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:36,480
name organic groups it used to be for

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:40,350
organically adding groups now most

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,720
people use it to create departments that

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,400
are not added organically at all right

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,820
so groups would have been maybe a better

00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,160
name another example would be you go to

00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,380
a site and you're looking for where to

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,270
edit a certain view of news you can't

00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,280
find it where's the main news of you oh

00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:59,460
I finally found it it's one of the

00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,590
displays in the home page news view

00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,810
because they started out making a view

00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:06,060
called home page news and then every

00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,890
time they added a new display of other

00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,870
type of news they just add it to that

00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:14,610
view because they were not thinking

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:16,680
ahead similar to extensibility is the

00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:21,360
need for malleability when you're naming

00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:23,700
things in Drupal things can be easily

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,940
changed but machine names are not one of

00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:29,100
those things so when you're making a

00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:33,120
machine name you have to really think

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:35,490
about not naming that the machine name

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,060
for up based on a property that might

00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:41,700
possibly change and a big example of

00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,560
that is when you name image styles so

00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,940
people like to name their image styles

00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:50,070
by the dimensions of the image so but

00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,680
that's a property that you can change so

00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:55,230
you end up having an image style called

00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,450
100 by 100 that's now actually eighty by

00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,550
eight this is going to be confusing

00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:01,560
every time anybody deals with this image

00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:06,180
style for the whole future of this

00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:08,490
website but the image styles are

00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,190
actually really smart the way they

00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:14,790
handle this in core and it's a model you

00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:18,810
can continue them they use the labels

00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:23,010
have the have both like a human name and

00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:25,470
then they put the dimensions in

00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:27,330
parentheses and then in the machine name

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,190
they don't put the dimensions because

00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,650
the human name can easily be changed

00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:33,360
it's not being referenced by your views

00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:37,080
and your content types and all other

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,649
parts of your site so sometimes it's

00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,579
okay to

00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:43,529
make the human name a little bit more

00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:50,399
specific but be more careful with the

00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:52,170
machine name the reason that you want

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,999
things to be consistent and malleable

00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:59,399
and extensible is usability and you only

00:11:56,999 --> 00:12:02,850
need to be concerned with usability if

00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:04,709
your website is looked at by humans or

00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:08,100
managed by humans or maintained by

00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:11,550
humans if it's not it's not a big

00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:14,129
problem maintainability is pretty much

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:17,429
the same thing as usability but it's

00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:19,410
really more for the developers and maybe

00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:21,569
the sysadmin that's that's dealing with

00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:25,350
the site but it's just another kind of

00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:29,069
usability and having things well named

00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,600
is a huge benefit for all of these

00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:33,300
people who are going to be working on

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,689
the site and every single time something

00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,189
is confusingly named it creates

00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:42,319
confusion after confusion after

00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:45,809
confusion I had a client once that had

00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:48,600
some kind of a term that they would use

00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:50,910
as they would say we need to change the

00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,540
fields on engagements and we would say

00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:56,370
okay what our engagements and there was

00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,959
never like a good answer but if we

00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,959
really pushed it and tried to get it in

00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:03,029
writing the answer was certain things

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,040
from this content type plus these three

00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:08,670
other content types but not if they have

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:11,399
this term on them and and not the things

00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:13,949
that we added last year but the new

00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,860
thing like so every time they would say

00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:18,899
this term that didn't map to anything on

00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,569
their site it turned into this half now

00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:23,069
or a conversation like over and over and

00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:25,649
over again where we would say what does

00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:27,899
that mean that we can't process it our

00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:30,209
brains would explode we would then not

00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:33,179
be able to work for half of the day then

00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:36,480
we would be drunk I mean the problems

00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:41,730
that they escalate from like one bad

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:43,799
naming thing are pretty unreal so how do

00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,819
you make sure that you're doing good

00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:50,550
name I think the answer to this is to

00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:54,180
have an architecture plan so

00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:56,910
the problem is there's different frames

00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,500
of mind when you're doing work in even

00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,050
one person can switch frames of mind

00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,730
it's difficult to be in all of them all

00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,720
at the same time so there's like a site

00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,550
building frame of mind where you're

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,779
clicking the forms and you're going

00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,459
through and you're doing everything

00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,899
there's a writing free of mind there's a

00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:13,470
planning free of mine there's a designer

00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:15,810
frame of mind it's difficult to be doing

00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:19,920
all the clicking and also at the same

00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:22,950
time be thinking about how to write the

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,110
help text right it's easier if all that

00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:26,970
planning is done at once and it's better

00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:29,279
if the planning is all done in one place

00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:32,040
because then you can see the consistency

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,079
you can create that consistency ahead of

00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,760
time instead of having like five people

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,399
all building different parts of the site

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,200
and making their own decisions it's much

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,120
easier to get this straight so what I

00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:48,930
like to use is for architecture plan

00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:54,209
okay sure I will ask for template to get

00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:58,940
me started I like to use a plan that I

00:14:54,209 --> 00:15:01,920
got from this blog post on palantir and

00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,390
I've adjusted it a little bit but you

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,670
should read this blog post if you don't

00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:09,870
have a great architecture plan template

00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:12,329
they call it the build spec so I just

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:16,079
use a version of that you should read

00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:20,370
that blog post and this is the

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:22,500
architecture plan template and what it

00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,990
does better than you know you just kind

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,730
of writing your own little outline of

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,620
how the site should be built is it

00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:31,020
reminds you about a bunch of important

00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,270
things and gives you a place where you

00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:37,110
have to fill those all it so the first

00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:39,720
tab is for content types and it gives

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:42,270
you like some some demo stuff that you

00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,490
can remove but like it has a field for

00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,079
description so you can put in the

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,959
descriptions for all the content types

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:52,980
right then and there and make them you

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,510
know all be grammatically similar you

00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,570
can figure out what your machine names

00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:59,699
will be and then there's a whole

00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,890
separate section on fields because of

00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:03,059
how fields can be used in multiple

00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:05,819
entities

00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:07,799
and you know if you figure out

00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:10,469
everything that you will need to tell

00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:12,899
your site builder to put in there then

00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:15,059
you figure out your view modes for your

00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:17,309
entity types and you can when you're

00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:20,099
doing this you can come up with naming

00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:22,379
systems that work across parts of your

00:16:20,099 --> 00:16:26,669
site for example I could make a view

00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:30,359
mate mode called micro and then I could

00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:33,089
create an image style where's the image

00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:35,279
Style section that was also called micro

00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:37,589
and then it would be really obvious that

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,139
the micro image style was used in the

00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:42,719
micro view mode and you wouldn't have to

00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:44,489
do one of those weird hunts where you

00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:48,539
figured out which image styles were

00:16:44,489 --> 00:16:51,059
being used where so I really recommend

00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:53,159
filling one of these out for every

00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:56,459
project and then this lets the site

00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:58,739
builders not have to be quite as

00:16:56,459 --> 00:17:01,589
thoughtful and they can build the entire

00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:04,669
site super fast and make it really great

00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:04,669
and really consistent

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,370
so second part is going to be about

00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:20,170
respecting the names so this is about

00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:22,770
thinking of the the names and vocabulary

00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:26,560
that already exists in Drupal and

00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:29,470
honoring those names so instead of just

00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:34,270
saying to yourself well I know how to

00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:36,550
use taxonomy so I'm going to use it for

00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:38,620
things that have nothing to do with

00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:42,670
categorization I'm just going to use it

00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:44,770
for creating one off pages with access

00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:48,070
control to them but i'm not actually

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:49,990
categorizing anything when you when you

00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:53,710
don't respect the names you create a

00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:58,300
system that other people can't make any

00:17:53,710 --> 00:18:02,110
sense of and that's not a good thing so

00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:06,360
the first concept in sort of Drupal

00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:09,520
architecture world is the entity and

00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:13,870
it's this sort of like a non-word and

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:16,630
filia we just call it John but it means

00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:20,880
a defined chunk of data and Drupal to

00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:24,820
get this from the Drupal glossary and

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:28,260
every every type of entity has its

00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:31,180
purpose they're nodes users files

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,250
taxonomy terms and there's a bunch of

00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:36,310
cusp there's a bunch of contributes that

00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:40,300
also add their own entity types if

00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:43,990
you're creating a chunk of data that

00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:48,130
might have fields on it and it doesn't

00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:49,420
match what any of these things are what

00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,620
their definition is you don't you

00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,510
shouldn't just say to yourself at least

00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,850
in Drupal 7 land Drupal 6 land everyone

00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:56,710
just said forget about it's a node it's

00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:59,770
best we can do but we can do better now

00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:02,530
and so if yours if your thing that you

00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:05,050
need to make is not content and it's not

00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:06,910
a user and it's not a category it's not

00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:10,570
a file think about making your own

00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:13,240
entity type because ultimately that

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:15,730
might make your site just make more

00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,940
sense instead of just saying yeah some

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:21,169
of our content types aren't really for

00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:24,659
content let me explain that to you again

00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:27,029
it'll make a lot more your site will be

00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:30,059
much nicer if everything's organized by

00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:32,039
you know what they actually are and it's

00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:34,230
really not that hard to have a drupal

00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:38,639
developer create a new entity type for

00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:40,289
you and then the next sort of most

00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:43,019
important thing after an entity type is

00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:46,379
a content type because we are a CMS so

00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:49,940
content is still king and there's these

00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:53,960
are three definitions for content type

00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:58,830
the first one is sort of a site builders

00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:01,169
definition and the second one is more of

00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:05,159
a developer's definition technically

00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:12,090
it's a bundle of the node entity let me

00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:17,309
show you how you add a content type so

00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:18,690
oh you're too big droopy yeah if you get

00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:23,009
the droop would be module he'll come and

00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:24,149
tell you while you're doing things so

00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:27,929
yeah you should make the title

00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:34,019
capitalized and singular and include a

00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:38,009
helpful description for editors so

00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:40,080
obviously if what you're creating is not

00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:42,450
a type of content don't make a content

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,529
type if you're if what you're creating

00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:49,049
is not a set of fields and settings

00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:51,690
appropriate to a set of content don't

00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:54,360
make a content type if you can't figure

00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:56,850
out what you should do instead take the

00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,460
time to plan and talk to other people

00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:01,500
don't just try to get this done as fast

00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,850
as possible remember you're creating the

00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:07,379
data structure for an organization

00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:11,460
ultimately a data structure should last

00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:13,200
much longer than a website because this

00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,539
will influence how the data gets

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,580
migrated and how clean it is when it

00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:19,200
finally goes into a new system the data

00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,059
structure is all they have it's the most

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,429
important thing yeah they might be very

00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:27,600
focused on the design but it's the data

00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:30,500
structure that is really the deliverable

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,500
on one level

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:36,510
the word node I don't know how much they

00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,890
thought about it when they called it

00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:41,309
that it might have just been another

00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:45,480
John type of word but I think it's

00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:49,020
interesting that what a node actually

00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,330
means it's it's a point where it's a

00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:54,330
point with Kinect connections right so

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:56,280
one point where things branch out and

00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:58,770
connect to other nodes and that's like

00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:01,049
the Internet itself and I think that

00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:02,640
word is really interesting because it

00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:04,710
really points to one of the biggest

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,299
strengths of Drupal as a content

00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:09,720
management system which is that the

00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:12,299
content is there to interconnect so

00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:15,059
every time you create a node you're

00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:18,059
automatically creating connections with

00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:20,970
the author of the node and with other

00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:23,730
content of that same type maybe you're

00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:26,070
connecting with through taxonomy to

00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,960
other content maybe of entity references

00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:30,480
they're connecting it if it's in organic

00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,299
groups it's connected to the group maybe

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,330
you're using flags or node q to connect

00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:39,179
it to other things but ultimately this

00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:41,940
idea of connected content is what makes

00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:44,880
websites so good nobody wants to go to a

00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:48,450
website where they just see one node and

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,070
it doesn't connect to lead them to see

00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,750
anything else is the internet it's about

00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,700
connections so I think that's it's

00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:57,390
interesting to think about that word but

00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:59,700
really the main way nodes get abuse is

00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:02,280
by people who think that a node means a

00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,919
page in Drupal nowhere on here does it

00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,890
say a node is a page in Drupal if that's

00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:10,799
the only way you know how to make a page

00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:14,280
in Drupal you should learn about page

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:17,760
manager and panels those are great ways

00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:24,780
to make pages that aren't just a piece

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:26,159
of content view modes are becoming more

00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,950
and more popular over the last couple of

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,860
years and every entity can have multiple

00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:35,640
view modes so like full and teaser are

00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:37,770
really popular ones display sweet is a

00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,169
is a pretty popular solution to having

00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,830
additional view modes I prefer a module

00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,929
called entity

00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,640
you view mode which is a lot simpler

00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:48,899
than display sweet that just lets you

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:51,360
add additional view modes the nice thing

00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:53,340
about adding view modes is you can name

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,580
your view modes and you can make them

00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:58,440
work across all the different bundles so

00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:02,370
you can say I'm going to make a view

00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:06,539
mode called search result and I'm going

00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:08,039
to create that for every bundle but all

00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:09,480
of them might be a little bit different

00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:11,940
some of them might have an image some of

00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,679
them don't have an image they might have

00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,539
extra fields hang on with the content

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,909
type is and then when you make a view

00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:20,669
like your search view using search api

00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:22,110
then you can just instead of putting in

00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:24,120
a whole bunch of fields and worrying

00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:25,409
about oh well on that content type

00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,480
actually wanted to see the date but on

00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:31,230
that one I didn't you can just put in

00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,760
which view mode you want to see as by

00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:35,610
picking a stiff fields you pick like

00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,409
full and rendered entity and that's a

00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:39,269
lot easier to maintain and be consistent

00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:41,549
make things nice across your site by

00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:48,750
naming these view modes and building

00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:52,769
everything up by that role in Drupal is

00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:56,309
the whole purpose of a user role is that

00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:59,850
crazy permissions page if you're just

00:24:56,309 --> 00:25:01,440
trying to categorize your users you need

00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:04,980
to come up with a different way to do it

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,600
because you're going to add all of these

00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,620
extra rolls onto that permissions page

00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:13,049
that's going to make it really difficult

00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:16,350
to securely maintain your site the the

00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:18,510
word roll means the function played by a

00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,950
person in a particular situation so

00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:22,620
think about that when you're naming your

00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:25,370
roles so that they're right says right

00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:29,880
there that if you're naming a role

00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:32,340
Margaret's role it's not a very good

00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:40,820
name a good name for a role is editor

00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:44,840
blogger administrator let me show you

00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,840
the adding of roles

00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:57,600
another enrolls somehow you make things

00:25:53,850 --> 00:26:00,240
lowercase a really important thing that

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:06,270
Drupal you're saying is you should drag

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:08,250
these rolls into a logical order and if

00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:11,640
you do that then when you go to the

00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:14,790
permissions page you can kind of do a

00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:17,850
security audit of your site in like five

00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:22,520
seconds because you can just see what is

00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:22,520
on the Left versus what's on the right

00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:33,420
I'm super interested in paths

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:36,600
breadcrumbs and venues and that's often

00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:41,130
called like paths are they called like

00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:43,740
semantic URLs so the whole idea of a

00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:46,230
semantic URL is that you can actually

00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,850
read the URL and Drupal's always been

00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,890
great that because there's the path

00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:54,960
module and path auto so people always

00:26:49,890 --> 00:27:00,420
make nice semantic URLs that that that

00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:02,520
is good for SEO but not everybody make

00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:05,250
sure that their paths are actually

00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,230
traversable it's really important to

00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:10,740
make your paths reversible so they

00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:13,860
should pretend that your files are in a

00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:16,500
directory system and that people could

00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:18,390
take away parts between the slashes and

00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:21,150
get to a real page if you've ever been

00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:23,340
on a site and you're kind of a little

00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:25,710
bit lost and you're and you're trying to

00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:28,140
look for a landing page so you take away

00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:31,680
part of the URL to get to on and that's

00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,750
not there that's very irritating and I

00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:37,410
really believe that a site should be

00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:39,690
treated as a single tree so if you

00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:42,000
picture your whole site as a directory

00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:46,500
that then has sub directories inside of

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,260
it just what they used to be I think

00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:53,700
that that one single tree should be the

00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:56,690
just one single menu and that way if you

00:27:53,700 --> 00:28:00,500
have a single menu you're

00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:03,200
can then be totally matching your

00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:05,870
breadcrumbs and your breadcrumbs can be

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,170
in in line with the menu tree and

00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:16,520
everything is just one to one and I'll

00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:17,930
give you an example of that which by

00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:22,100
late I don't think Drupal really does

00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:27,680
that well out-of-the-box what I do is I

00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:30,770
put my default path pattern to node menu

00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:35,060
link parents join path / new title and

00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:37,490
what that does is when you create a node

00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:41,000
and you put it in the menu it will

00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:43,910
automatically make the path match the

00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,490
menu position that you put it in so if

00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:48,110
you did it manually then the path will

00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,140
just match where it is in the menu and

00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:53,000
then for you have a lot of content types

00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:56,230
that you don't usually put in the menu

00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,690
so usually like landing pages and

00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:01,840
regular pages those people have to put

00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:04,160
in the menu but something like events

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,860
those aren't put in the menu so you make

00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,570
patterns for those but you think about

00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,880
those patterns to this is something else

00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:13,730
you do an architecture planning document

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,610
so you make sure that there is a page at

00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:20,300
news events and that there is a page at

00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:24,430
News dash events / events and then when

00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:28,250
you create your events now their pattern

00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:31,070
matches a place in the menu on top of

00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:34,700
that I really like this module

00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:37,370
breadcrumbs by path you turn on bread

00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:40,430
crumbs by path and then as long as your

00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:42,140
paths are thoughtful and work your

00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:45,110
breadcrumbs now will be thoughtful and

00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:47,810
work so I don't use those on certain

00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:50,000
core pages that mess things up but I'll

00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:52,870
show you an example of the these two

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:58,010
things working together so here's a page

00:29:52,870 --> 00:30:01,810
the path is admission / graduate the

00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:05,980
bright chrome is admissions graduate and

00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:09,220
then the reason that it has that path is

00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:13,480
because it was put in the menu

00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:15,280
at that place so all you have to do is

00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,159
put the thing in the menu at the right

00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,960
place in the path and the breadcrumb

00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:24,039
work themselves out to all makes sense

00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:26,980
and then this is a page that was not put

00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:30,190
in the menu it's a research center so

00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:32,919
its path is research research center's

00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:35,470
name of the research center same thing

00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:37,929
as the breadcrumb and they didn't do

00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:41,850
anything when they made this because the

00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:41,850
path auto settings were set to do that

00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:54,950
so I think resourcefulness is not a

00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:57,260
great skill in building Drupal sites and

00:30:54,950 --> 00:31:01,270
that's because Drupal code is not really

00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:06,440
a finite resource so when you see people

00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:10,850
being resourceful a lot of times that's

00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:13,220
not for the best when I say being

00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:15,170
resourceful I mean that they're taking

00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:18,170
the the blocks that they have the Lego

00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:22,100
blocks that they have and no instead of

00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:23,660
asking around and researching and seeing

00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:26,930
what other blocks might be out there

00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:28,310
they come up with a tricky way to build

00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:31,970
something with the blocks that they've

00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:34,820
already got when you do that you end up

00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:37,940
creating a frankan site that is just

00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:43,700
never going to be as as good as it could

00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:48,400
be so I think one not against creative

00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:51,170
solutions to problems I think when you I

00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:55,460
think the way to tell whether your

00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:59,140
creative solution is a good one or not

00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:01,880
is whether it semantically it's

00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:06,860
consistent and makes sense and is easy

00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:09,950
to explain to others with actual words

00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:13,880
if your plan is sort of impossible to

00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:16,550
explain quickly it's not a good plan by

00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:20,470
definition because other people won't be

00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:20,470
able to understand it and work with it

00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:31,710
so the problem with the reason I think

00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:35,730
this stuff is very is very important is

00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:38,460
that it takes a lot more work to fix

00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:41,759
these problems than it does to think

00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:44,850
about them in the first place and I

00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:48,029
think that some of the reason that we

00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:52,100
see bad work being done in site building

00:32:48,029 --> 00:32:56,759
is that as a community we we value it

00:32:52,100 --> 00:33:00,000
lower than development and and some of

00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:01,470
the other skills that people have I mean

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,320
I think there's there's definitely this

00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:07,049
sort of a bit of a culture in our

00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:10,169
community where people who are like web

00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:14,360
performance experts they're like super

00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:18,360
awesome right and people who are really

00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:20,909
into making a really well configured

00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:24,269
WYSIWYG it's like okay whatever but

00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:27,149
actually it's totally unfair all every

00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:29,789
single discipline you can become an

00:33:27,149 --> 00:33:33,480
expert in it every one is super

00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:35,610
important to having a great site and so

00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,980
site building I think because it's it's

00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:42,379
easy to get started in it's really just

00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:45,059
clicking through a lot of people like to

00:33:42,379 --> 00:33:48,269
move out of that instead of becoming

00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:49,980
truly an expert in creating good

00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:52,769
architectures and doing good site

00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:55,230
building and even though it's actually

00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:59,370
probably the the most important part of

00:33:55,230 --> 00:34:01,500
building these sites so an example is

00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:04,919
and I've seaside really see things like

00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:08,460
this the people people when they create

00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:10,139
content types they just create that you

00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:12,389
know what it's very easy to create them

00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:14,490
isn't it takes about five seconds takes

00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:18,629
a lot longer to remove them removing

00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:21,599
them consists of a couple of conference

00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:23,069
calls creating a back-up plan for what

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,889
happens if they change their mind after

00:34:23,069 --> 00:34:27,149
I removed it so I can bring it all back

00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:29,700
how we're going to merge all of the

00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:31,440
fields into this into this other content

00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,000
type we're going to write some scripts

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,990
we're going to test them going to deploy

00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,940
them it's it's a it's a big project

00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:46,139
that's created in only a couple of

00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:51,270
seconds and so I do a lot of sight

00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:54,360
cleanups and and they are they are

00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:55,950
pretty crazy because almost always you

00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,140
can guarantee at the beginning of the

00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:59,520
project that it would cost much less and

00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:04,710
give you much better result to start

00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:10,170
over and that is how serious building

00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:13,170
things badly can be and I think a lot of

00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:15,780
times things are built sloppily because

00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:19,560
somebody asks you to build something

00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:21,540
that isn't really your not really able

00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,040
to do it and you don't know how to do it

00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,450
and maybe the tools out there are

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,250
actually not available for the budget

00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:28,920
that they want to spend on it but you

00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:32,070
say yes anyway and you build them

00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,540
something that now is impossible for

00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:36,930
anyone to maintain and now they're still

00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:39,480
in Drupal 6 because they can't get out

00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:41,369
nobody even knows what that thing was

00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,170
that you built anymore or what it's

00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:48,060
doing or whether it's okay to turn it

00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:50,250
off and you know it's it's it's it's a

00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:53,490
serious thing we're working on project

00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:56,490
now that has been close to a million

00:35:53,490 --> 00:36:00,000
dollars and it's on Drupal 6 and we

00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:03,480
haven't built the site we are just

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,430
trying to keep it from blowing up their

00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:10,430
entire business four million dollars

00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:17,910
we've had to put into work that is

00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:20,160
fixing a pit of bad decisions that that

00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:24,750
was made in a much shorter amount of

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:27,260
time so i think it's it's important to

00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:29,760
to treat this stuff even though it's

00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,920
even though it's just click click click

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,190
ok this is really fast and easy treat it

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,170
a little bit more like surgery measure

00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:39,420
twice cut once I don't know if that's

00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:42,750
what surgeons do I'm not a surgeon

00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:49,640
I don't know if they have a ruler or

00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:52,500
what but keep your environment clean and

00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:54,410
yeah you can't solve your problems on

00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,240
the same level you created them on

00:36:54,410 --> 00:37:00,180
unfortunately so even though so Drupal

00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:05,220
doesn't have a super quick and easy

00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:09,180
module that that fixes everything and so

00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:15,059
the way that that I really advocate for

00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:17,400
an organization like a Drupal shop to to

00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:20,130
to make sure that they're doing good

00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,770
work every time is by having quality

00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:24,630
standards and my background is as an

00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:27,089
analytical chemist before I came into

00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:28,890
the web and so quality was our entire

00:37:27,089 --> 00:37:32,849
department that was all we did and I

00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:35,760
always find it odd that in development

00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:38,280
even though we hear all the time about

00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,290
disasters I just told you about one and

00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:43,200
of course healthcare.gov was the first

00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:45,089
major engineering disaster to like you

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,069
know be hit everyone's attention even

00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:49,230
though we knew for a long time as

00:37:47,069 --> 00:37:51,599
engineers that this is always happening

00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:54,510
this is very common I always found it

00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:58,980
very odd that in this field quality

00:37:54,510 --> 00:38:03,089
isn't a huge deal there is no quality

00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:06,150
con for you know for for development

00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:09,839
even though it's it's very critical and

00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:13,230
it causes serious losses of money it's

00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:14,730
sort of something that nobody spends a

00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:18,510
lot of time on so so one of the ways

00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:26,220
that that I enforce quality standards

00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:28,349
with my team is with review so every all

00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:31,440
the work that happens happens in a

00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:33,420
ticket and everything that's done goes

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,319
into a git commit that's associated with

00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:40,260
that ticket and everything gets reviewed

00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:43,200
by the Lee the development later on that

00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:46,740
project or by someone else who knows the

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,990
area well and so we don't just think of

00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,790
that as code review like like they do on

00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:52,170
on drupal.org even though it's sort of a

00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:55,790
similar model

00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:59,309
because we're also reviewing things like

00:38:55,790 --> 00:39:02,369
just site building decisions and naming

00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:05,099
and you know just just anything that

00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:07,619
that is going into the process is being

00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:09,900
reviewed to make sure that everything is

00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:12,359
consistent that the quality is there

00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:14,640
that nothing was spelled wrong that you

00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:16,619
know because the seer you catch these

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,640
problems the less expensive they are

00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:22,710
because what happens is you build around

00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:25,380
problems and you built into problems and

00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:29,040
so catching them early and stopping them

00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:31,260
is way less expensive than skipping this

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,290
kind of review in order to allegedly

00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:37,680
save money and then kind of having like

00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:39,750
a huge unknown mass later on so I really

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:43,829
recommend that to everyone that just

00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:46,140
make it not optional that everything in

00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:49,400
your organization has to get reviewed

00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,400
before it's just part of the process

00:39:50,390 --> 00:40:00,119
questions from the audience at this time

00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:02,780
I think you have to use a mic but okay

00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:02,780
there you

00:40:12,339 --> 00:40:20,019
hi I have a question if you're using an

00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:23,140
existing field between many content

00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:25,479
types is there semantic advice do you

00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:27,609
keep the same label across the name or

00:40:25,479 --> 00:40:29,410
is it okay to sort of change it so it's

00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:32,259
a little more specific to that content

00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:35,849
type to the content editor and thanks

00:40:32,259 --> 00:40:38,650
for the talk is really um so that is a

00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:40,930
is a really interesting question and one

00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:44,559
that I don't have a definite answer to

00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:47,469
so so how do you deal with fields that

00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:48,940
you're sharing between content types and

00:40:47,469 --> 00:40:51,009
a lot of people also ask the question as

00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:53,049
should I even share fields between

00:40:51,009 --> 00:40:55,089
content types or it's between entity

00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:59,799
bundles or shape just make a separate

00:40:55,089 --> 00:41:01,690
field for each one and it also has to do

00:40:59,799 --> 00:41:03,099
with how you organize your features if

00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:04,839
you're using features module and I'm

00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:11,140
sorry for everyone because everyone is

00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:12,759
and which is like probably why dev seed

00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,380
had to leave they left is kind of like

00:41:12,759 --> 00:41:25,630
they farted in the room and then they

00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:27,219
had to leave so the UM the some people

00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:29,259
don't like to share their fields because

00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:32,019
they'd like to keep their features so

00:41:29,259 --> 00:41:33,849
they can be reusable I have never in my

00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:36,849
life seen anyone reuse a feature which

00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:38,410
is the whole point of features so I

00:41:36,849 --> 00:41:43,029
think a lot of times in Drupal we do a

00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:45,219
lot of work in order to meet a goal

00:41:43,029 --> 00:41:48,309
that's not one that our clients care

00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:51,369
about or we ever use it's just sort of

00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:57,160
like best practice but nobody ever even

00:41:51,369 --> 00:42:01,089
needs that feature um so I mean I I

00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:04,509
usually just give fields a name that

00:42:01,089 --> 00:42:06,789
makes sense for that field and then just

00:42:04,509 --> 00:42:08,049
share them if they're really the exact

00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:09,190
same thing and it's much easier to

00:42:08,049 --> 00:42:10,930
figure that out when you're making the

00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:12,819
architecture plan that when you're just

00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,930
building a content type and you have to

00:42:12,819 --> 00:42:17,829
try to figure out what's going on with

00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:20,319
the other ones hi um I think this is

00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:21,549
great I'm always I'm a site builder and

00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,349
I'm always hitting my head against the

00:42:21,549 --> 00:42:24,190
wall because I'm being told her up and

00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:25,690
build the site hurry up

00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:27,640
build a site and I'm trying to do

00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:30,760
architecture at the same time be smart

00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:33,130
and I'm curious if you have advice about

00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:36,130
how to communicate the value of this to

00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:37,900
your information architect and so this

00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:39,310
kind of process can be happening and

00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,569
even to the clients at the end of the

00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:43,030
day they're the ones entering the

00:42:40,569 --> 00:42:45,220
content types so here I am guessing that

00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:46,990
what might make sense to the client but

00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:49,660
that's just wondering if you had advice

00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:52,930
on that um I guess I haven't run into

00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:56,109
that that much what we do is when we

00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:59,079
find something that really benefits our

00:42:56,109 --> 00:43:02,740
clients we just add it as a deliverable

00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:05,410
in in the next project and we just say

00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:07,930
hey one of our discovery deliverables is

00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:10,210
going to be this architecture plan and

00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:11,440
we're going to be working with you and

00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:14,290
you're going to be we're going to walk

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,940
you through our draft of it and try to

00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:17,380
get some feedback from you at that point

00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,880
a lot of times clients don't really

00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:20,710
understand the architecture plan and

00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,900
they don't like to refer back to it

00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:25,030
later but yeah I think by making it as

00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,819
having a specific budget for it and

00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:30,460
putting it in the in a discovery sprint

00:43:27,819 --> 00:43:31,869
and not letting yourself get into a

00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:34,900
situation where it's like okay we're

00:43:31,869 --> 00:43:37,000
just building the site but we never had

00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:39,430
the time to do a plan I mean one of the

00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,050
things that we do is two weeks prints so

00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:43,210
we can say hey we're having a discovery

00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:46,599
for two weeks we're not touching the

00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:47,710
site until that's over and then for the

00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:49,270
next two weeks we're going to do this

00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:50,470
and then and then this and this and that

00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:52,000
way you can't get into this situation

00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:54,310
where it's like okay just build the

00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:02,800
whole thing really fast you know thank

00:43:54,310 --> 00:44:04,839
you hi my name is Mario I'm a front-end

00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,359
developer and also a site builder who

00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:09,310
shares your feeling about you know

00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:11,440
making sure that your URLs match your

00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:15,010
breadcrumbs and I like to keep that kind

00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,300
of thing that way but one of the

00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:19,660
challenges that I have with the project

00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:23,319
is that our main navigation didn't

00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:28,300
include all the main categories that our

00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:30,460
site needed so we were forced because of

00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:34,240
management decisions to create a sub

00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:35,859
navigation for the site however I wanted

00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,900
that solve navigation which was very

00:44:35,859 --> 00:44:41,830
important to be part of my

00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:45,430
crumbs and the only way I was able to

00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:48,010
accomplish that is by adding the sub

00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:50,800
navigation to my main menu by hiding it

00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:52,960
from view so so I could at least get the

00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,480
benefit of the breadcrumbs and I'm

00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,370
wondering whether there is a better

00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,890
solution to be able to include that kind

00:44:57,370 --> 00:45:01,720
of navigation in a way that it makes

00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:04,360
more sense than whether it's not hacking

00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:07,600
it the way I did I think Drupal's core

00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:12,580
menu system is insane and the

00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:14,440
breadcrumbs are even crazier so it

00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:16,480
creates all kinds of problems like if

00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:19,180
you have multiple menus or if you have

00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,220
what happens a lot is you have one page

00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:23,020
that's in more than one place in the

00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,730
menu and then you're like oh the

00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:30,040
breadcrumb isn't in the right place and

00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:31,990
all kinds of things like that I find

00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:35,400
that using that bread crumbs by path

00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:37,660
module it doesn't care which menu

00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:40,720
something was in it just looks at the

00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:43,210
path so that way you don't have to worry

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:45,040
about all the menu nonsense you can just

00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:48,010
give things the right path and then

00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:50,860
they'll have the right breadcrumb and i

00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:54,240
also have a patch i I didn't mention yet

00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:58,620
I have a starter kit distribution that i

00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:01,870
use for every project that's called bear

00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:05,410
it's a stupid word project bear and it

00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:07,180
has in it a lot of my though it's just

00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:10,000
kind of like the way I think core should

00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:13,180
be out of the box it has a nice WYSIWYG

00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,810
like obviously Drupal 8 does but it also

00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:21,280
has a bunch of patches in it and one of

00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:24,460
the patches that it has is helps a lot

00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,070
with dealing with menu positions if

00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:31,000
something's in the menu more than once

00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:32,830
so what all it does and it's as a patch

00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:39,250
that's laundry blur or just you know how

00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:41,680
things take years to go in when you put

00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:45,250
something in the menu when you're

00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:47,320
editing a node it makes that the

00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:48,950
canonical menu position because you can

00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:51,950
only you can only put

00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:53,810
in one mini position when you're editing

00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:55,220
the note but when you get a menu

00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:57,020
administrator you can put it in as many

00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:59,420
times as you want well since you can

00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:01,400
only put it in once here I said let's

00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:03,470
make that the canonical position that we

00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,270
based the breadcrumbs after and that way

00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:06,410
if you want to change which one's the

00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:07,940
canonical position because your

00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:11,240
breadcrumbs aren't right just change

00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:13,040
this we don't need to make a new UI for

00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:16,070
that and where we can say which ones

00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:18,130
canonical right so yeah that would be my

00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:22,940
advice on that it's okay to have a

00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:24,500
second menu but just base your bread

00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:32,920
crumbs off paths and things will be

00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:35,480
simpler is it a problem if you have

00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:38,570
semantic machine names to have them be

00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:41,540
too long as long as they're descriptive

00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:43,670
and also is it overkill to for a single

00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:47,839
project to prefix all your machine names

00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:49,250
for everything with you know the short

00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:52,339
code for the project or name for the

00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:55,220
project okay so for the first question

00:47:52,339 --> 00:47:59,750
it can be a problem to have your machine

00:47:55,220 --> 00:48:02,119
names be too long because there just

00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:04,099
isn't enough room in the database field

00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:05,810
but it just won't even fit in there and

00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:07,550
then they'll truncate it for you other

00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:09,650
modules like I think a lot of like the

00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:11,210
Earl miles views panels modules what

00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:12,829
they'll do they'll hash up the whole

00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:15,260
machine name and then you'll end up

00:48:12,829 --> 00:48:18,380
being like trying to theme something

00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:21,260
you'd like well why is my ID called vuze

00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:22,490
dash h 4 9am because it like hashed up

00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:26,569
your machine name because your machine

00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:29,480
name was too long for it that can be

00:48:26,569 --> 00:48:31,760
kind of annoying but i think you know

00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:36,500
overall it's you want you always want

00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:38,480
things to be as small and few as you can

00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:42,260
while still having enough descriptive

00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:44,210
information to get the job done as far

00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:46,430
as putting a prefix on everything I

00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:51,650
think maybe some people read an article

00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:55,010
recently that came from Stanford I think

00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:56,720
that about how to name your features and

00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:58,410
how to organize everything in your

00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:01,079
feature so the features can be reused

00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:03,510
able between different departments and I

00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:07,349
think they were talking about how naming

00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:11,180
your fields that way but in general I I

00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:14,069
don't think that you need to put

00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:15,690
prefixes in your field names unless

00:49:14,069 --> 00:49:17,160
you're doing something really

00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:18,690
complicated where you're sharing between

00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:22,319
things the only thing that you really

00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:25,049
need to prefix consistently are your

00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:27,530
modules and the functions that are in

00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:35,160
there so that you don't like create a

00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:36,420
naming conflict okay um you may have

00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,490
spoken a little bit too at a moment ago

00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:40,380
but when one of my biggest problems that

00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:42,890
I've had from the technical lead side of

00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:44,430
it for building architecture plan is

00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:46,619
maintaining it throughout the

00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:48,960
development process especially if you're

00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:51,210
using an agile process where different

00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,599
iterations change it so what are some

00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:56,069
strategies you use for them well that is

00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:57,900
definitely a problem and I definitely

00:49:56,069 --> 00:49:59,780
have that problem sometimes I just say

00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:03,690
you know what now we've got the thing

00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:05,910
going and everything kind of the main

00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:07,890
architecture is done and now we're just

00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:10,349
doing tweaks just don't worry about the

00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:12,329
architecture plan anymore it it started

00:50:10,349 --> 00:50:13,770
us up let's not keep maintaining it

00:50:12,329 --> 00:50:15,869
because now it's just slowing us down

00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:18,559
that we have to like maintain two things

00:50:15,869 --> 00:50:21,990
hopefully it gets you to a place where

00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:23,609
your site has a good structure and it's

00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:25,520
making sense and people can just kind of

00:50:23,609 --> 00:50:28,289
maintain that as they're adding little

00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,789
changes because it does kind of become

00:50:28,289 --> 00:50:31,980
like this burden like do I really have

00:50:29,789 --> 00:50:35,609
to change it in two places sometimes

00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:37,740
I'll just because a lot of times I'm

00:50:35,609 --> 00:50:39,569
just assigning something to a site

00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:41,130
builder and then and there doing I'll

00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:43,020
just tell them that you have to maintain

00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:45,650
our picture plant as you make those

00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:48,930
changes but ultimately I feel like

00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:51,599
everything sometimes gets in the way at

00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:53,430
a certain point it's like are you really

00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,900
going to maintain this for posterity and

00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:57,510
put it in a frame later like at a

00:50:54,900 --> 00:51:00,210
certain point it's like okay we that got

00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:01,529
us that did its job you know it's sort

00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:03,569
of like the same thing with the design

00:51:01,529 --> 00:51:07,190
like you don't keep going back and

00:51:03,569 --> 00:51:09,809
revising the wireframes forever so

00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:11,160
building on that then probably from that

00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:11,640
discovery sprint you talk about having

00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,470
early

00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,690
on then that would build the bulk of

00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:17,730
your your architecture plan and then

00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:19,230
probably not too long after that once

00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:20,550
you have all the content types of fine

00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:22,770
and everything that would probably be

00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:24,090
when you had abandoned it yeah but then

00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:26,250
if there's another sprint where you're

00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:28,740
building a major new feature you might

00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:31,170
do like a little mini architecture plan

00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:33,030
just for that part that makes sense

00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:40,260
thanks and you made some good points

00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:43,370
things this is somewhat of a related

00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:45,660
question but um do you have any ideas or

00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:47,340
strategies for dealing with the unknown

00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:48,750
unknowns when you're coming up with an

00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:51,120
architecture plan you know let's say

00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:52,830
that you have a vast body of product

00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:54,630
documentation that you're trying to

00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:58,410
organize for a particular group of

00:51:54,630 --> 00:52:00,660
people and over time those expectations

00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:01,920
change their new things that come to lie

00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:04,110
as far as what they want how they want

00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,490
it structured how do you accommodate

00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:07,740
that sort of thing from the very

00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:09,540
beginning or can you yeah i mean that's

00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:12,420
always super challenging and sometimes

00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:14,940
what I'll do if there's just if there's

00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:17,820
one or two areas of the project they're

00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:19,620
super sticky and the rest of it you can

00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:21,510
kind of get into shape well I'll just

00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:24,630
say we'll look during the discovery

00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:26,820
we're gonna do all of these things but

00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:30,120
the these other areas are going to need

00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:33,180
more time to figure out so we're going

00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:35,280
to have a whole separate section of the

00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:38,220
project just on those areas because

00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:40,260
otherwise they're going to take away all

00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:43,700
the attention from everything else and

00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:46,200
then you know if it's something that

00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:48,360
isn't isn't well defined yet but a lot

00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:50,610
of people care about it's going to need

00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:53,700
a lot of planning and a lot of

00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:56,430
discussions and you know maybe if if

00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,780
some of the people involved they might

00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:59,370
not really understand what they're doing

00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:02,430
when they're doing this architecture

00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:04,080
planning work with you until you're six

00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:05,820
months into the project and now they're

00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:09,720
starting to understand or they don't

00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:11,310
care until six that's right so yeah I

00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,950
mean you have to kind of go with your

00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:15,450
gut instinct that if something feels

00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:19,230
like it might become a problem it

00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:22,710
definitely will be and just try to keep

00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:23,460
on hitting it head on as much as that

00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:26,010
might be

00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:28,080
difficult great but that's the real hard

00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:35,490
work of these projects appreciate it

00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:37,500
thanks two things one if you wouldn't

00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:40,530
mind switching back to the screen that

00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:42,090
showed us your default breadcrumb path

00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:46,110
in case some of us did not finish

00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:48,570
copying it and then also I have a

00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:50,490
situation that I think is what you

00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:54,540
alluded to a few minutes ago where I

00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:56,790
have sets of nodes on a site that I'm

00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:58,470
building that I want to have them appear

00:53:56,790 --> 00:54:00,390
as if they really exist in two different

00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:02,220
places and I've of course assured my

00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:04,860
client I can do that and I'm thinking

00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:06,630
how do I do that is there a way that you

00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:08,280
know of other than the patch that you

00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:10,440
were referring to that where you can

00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,610
designate what's canonical do you

00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,410
understand what it means you need the

00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:16,590
path to be different depending on where

00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:19,200
they are or I want the breadcrumb to

00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:23,010
make people feel like they're still in

00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:25,190
Section a where in fact this content

00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:29,700
perhaps really exists in Section B

00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:32,700
that's a big problem and that's fairly

00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:34,830
common that people want that or they

00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:37,950
kind of want their bread crumbs to act

00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:40,350
like the back button yeah and they want

00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:42,270
it to be like well however you got there

00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:45,150
that's how you want to get back but

00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:50,400
ultimately these structures kind of just

00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:51,810
want to fit into a single tree and it's

00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,260
one of those things where I mean I'm

00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:58,980
sure you could come up with a solution

00:54:55,260 --> 00:55:02,130
for it and the solution would be so time

00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:05,460
consuming and so possibly brittle and

00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:08,100
bug inducing that I feel like if they

00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:12,390
could just live with it it would be

00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:15,240
better for their site yeah yes actually

00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:17,130
perhaps I could convince them that we

00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,660
should that it's so important this

00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:21,360
content that we should make it a

00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:22,470
free-standing section of its own yeah be

00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:26,850
that I mean another thing that you could

00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:28,160
do is you could sort of the content

00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:32,280
could be in one place we could have a

00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:36,040
separate page i got that brought in that

00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:37,960
piece of content you know like it

00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,970
I don't know how you would architect if

00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,790
it was I wouldn't make a view of just

00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:45,550
one thing but you know you can do maybe

00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:48,450
a panels page that that just brought in

00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:56,200
that one node for some special reason

00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:58,150
okay thank you sure what modules crumbs

00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,680
module I've used to i haven't used that

00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:03,460
one I've usually different breadcrumbs

00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:06,070
modules always looking for sanity but I

00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:08,380
think I've finally settled in this bread

00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:12,760
crumbs by path one you know could you

00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:16,210
switch over to the architect Excel or

00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:20,260
spreadsheet there yes oh there's there

00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:23,650
is a sandbox module called Merlin that

00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:26,250
will automatically take these fields and

00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:30,280
these elements and develop the site

00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:33,910
using behalf it's called serlin Merlin

00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:37,480
so it's it's using the palantir template

00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:39,580
you're saying or you can use an Excel

00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:43,860
template and it will read the Excel

00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:48,160
template then use automated testing

00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:50,820
techniques using the hat to go into your

00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:53,350
site and literally build it for you

00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:56,050
instead of you having to do it manually

00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:59,200
I like this pretty cool that's a sandbox

00:56:56,050 --> 00:57:05,520
yeah looking for like a nurse as well

00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:05,520
okay thanks you got to use the mic

00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:18,710
talking about that architecture plan

00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:22,070
template is that something that you care

00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:24,410
to share with the group yeah if you it's

00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:29,300
actually I mine is just a slightly

00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:33,380
changed copy from Palin tears and they

00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:36,619
shared this on their blog if you just

00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:43,270
look up palantir build spec they have a

00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:43,270
