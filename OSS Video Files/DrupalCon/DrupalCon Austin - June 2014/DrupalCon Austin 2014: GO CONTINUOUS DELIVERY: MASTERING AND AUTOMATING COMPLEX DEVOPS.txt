Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: GO CONTINUOUS DELIVERY: MASTERING AND AUTOMATING COMPLEX DEVOPS
Publication date: 2014-06-04
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: rgristrophAugust1914
We will show a complex and intimidating DevOps problem, involving multiple steps of integration, delivery, and even content staging. We will walk through a configuration of the open source Go Continuous Delivery system ( http://www.go.cd/ ) to implement the process in an understandable and managable way.

The audience will see an incredibly complex problem addressed in a series of simple understandable steps, as we walk through a build configuration that deploys Drupal sites using phing, drush, and other tools -- possibility of calling out to Jenkins as another way to manage tasks. We will watch a multistep process with multiple steps of testing and approval, and a separate path for content staging as separate from code, deploy a complex Drupal site.

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery will be implemented, producing a build process reliable enough so that the decision to release becomes a business rather than a technical decision.
