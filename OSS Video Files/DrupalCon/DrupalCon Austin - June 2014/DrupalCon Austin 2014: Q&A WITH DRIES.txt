awesome thank you for participating

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:16,650
today so the way this works is we put

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,569
out a blog post and we invited people to

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,319
submit questions ahead of time so we

00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:25,739
have a list of questions so we organize

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,540
them a little bit by topic but then

00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,950
definitely we want to encourage people

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,410
to ask questions in the room as well so

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,910
just as a warm-up we're going to go

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,950
through a number of questions that were

00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,560
you know submitted prior to this session

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:40,170
but then by all means feel free to raise

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,360
your hand or to walk up to the mic if

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,799
you have a follow-on question to do this

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,569
quest to the question that we're

00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:50,790
answering these are them up to the mics

00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:52,680
who can be recorded yes and then uh if

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,510
if time in the end we would love to get

00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:00,870
you know just questions from the

00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:05,310
audience sorry said of you oh I nearly

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:08,970
sierra's all hell I know we may have a

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:11,400
question for you all right so let's just

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:14,069
as a warm-up we got a few questions

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,750
around the readiness of Drupal 8 and the

00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:19,079
first question which I'm going to have

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:22,709
just answer is when will Drupal a be

00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:24,420
released that's everyone's favorite

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:25,650
question it really is the most important

00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,350
question I think that a lot of tripura

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,639
developers have right now so to answer

00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,340
this I'm going to try to give a little

00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:35,880
background in context the development

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:38,190
branch of Drupal 8 opened shortly it

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:42,239
will actually it opened at triple con

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:44,400
Chicago in in 2011 in March but it

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,069
wasn't really it didn't really start to

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,420
become its own branch of development

00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:50,579
until much later in that year I think

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,190
the first major change was in November

00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:54,660
of 2011 so really 2012 is when

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,180
development under polite really started

00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:00,540
in earnest we're now in 2014 a little

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,730
bit over two years after that and the

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,510
the feature for use for Drupal 8 was in

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:09,239
December 2012 and then a feature

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,519
completion phase after that we said that

00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,680
we were going to stop changing we had

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,840
our API freeze deadline for wide open

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,070
change Dylan api's last summer and so

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,870
lens since last summer we've been

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,650
creating alpha releases of Drupal 8 so

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,650
right now we're in the

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:25,530
alpha phase um the next step is to

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,449
Greece release a beta release that's the

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,030
release that contributed module authors

00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:32,310
can start hopefully using to start

00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,380
putting their modules it's it's more

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,030
stable than alpha it'll be more

00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,009
finalized in order to do that I have a

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,720
up on the screen here there are 15

00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:42,539
critical issues that we need to fix

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,800
before we can release the beta and this

00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:45,300
is this is when you might have heard the

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,949
keynote Drees offered us all ice cream

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,199
so what we need to do is fix these 15

00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:50,639
issues and we all get ice cream but in

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,110
addition to all getting ice cream on

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,780
with that also means that we moved your

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,949
bones into the sort of the final stretch

00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,169
of the release cycle where we release

00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:01,050
beta releases get feedback from module

00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:03,720
developers but then after that once we

00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,039
get the beta out after that then i'm

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,570
looking at my drupal at org dashboard

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,030
here you can see that there are 49

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:11,849
critical bugs and 48 critical tasks so

00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,289
those issues those you know 97 issues

00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:16,650
are the issues we need to get done to

00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:18,389
get your blade out so it's Drupal 8

00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,180
point 0 is not going to be out this

00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:22,500
summer barring you know a miracle or you

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,680
know hundreds of thousands of dollars of

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:29,820
your enterprise clients time um but be

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,260
okay too please help but it went

00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,270
wonderfully point out comes out it

00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,680
depends both on your contribution and

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,039
your activity in the HSN it also depends

00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,599
on us because so in these you know 49

00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,979
critical bugs for get critical tasks

00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:42,990
there are some issues in there that we

00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:45,030
might decide you know actually this is

00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,610
not worth stopping the world from using

00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,740
Triple H Triple it is already amazing

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,180
the code base is radically improved over

00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,130
what was available in Drupal 7 in terms

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,530
of its extensibility and it's you know

00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,599
modern best practices it has amazing

00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:00,150
functionality in it and so I encourage

00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:02,400
everyone to when you're when you're

00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,860
looking at issues in the in the Drupal

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,050
AQ really stop and ask yourself first of

00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,120
all is this something that really really

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,500
should stop everyone else or slow down

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,510
everyone else from using your blade and

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,190
maybe is there a place I could direct my

00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:17,130
efforts instead they would help get your

00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,180
blade out sooner and I think were going

00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,310
to talk a little bit more in a little

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,870
bit about some of the other ways that

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,849
you know if there's something that you

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,889
think I really want to do this but it's

00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:28,260
not essential maybe it can wait and we

00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:31,020
have some more questions about how that

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:33,599
can wait and how that's changed

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,650
awesome and then so there's an actually

00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:35,849
another question which is a great

00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,970
follow-up question so I'll give it back

00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:41,129
to you but somebody asks you know

00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:44,370
basically somebody has a potential

00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:46,800
customer or a customer that would like

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,750
to build a new website on Drupal that

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,520
website has a lot of API integrations

00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:54,330
which is something a Drupal ages you

00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:57,360
know better at than Drupal 7 and so the

00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,669
customer would like to launch or go into

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,590
beta in three months from today and so

00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:06,360
the question is do I use your plate or

00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:09,960
do I use Drupal 7 Drupal 7 bottom line

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,880
drupal 8 will not be at a release

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,830
candidate like I said it will not be at

00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:17,430
a release candidate the summer barring

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:19,229
something very surprising um the the one

00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:23,130
the one time that I might change that

00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:25,409
answer is if you have the resources if

00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:28,050
you have developers you can devote to

00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:30,060
work on Drupal 8 core and fix problems

00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,129
and do what we call chasing head which

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:36,389
means even though we're not supplying an

00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:37,800
upgrade path yet um continue to keep up

00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,789
to date with the changes that happen in

00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,169
your blade even though we're not

00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:42,750
supporting it and there are people who

00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:44,520
already are doing this amazing labs you

00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,819
might have had a chance to see a session

00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,990
by schnitzel i think it was yesterday so

00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:51,060
that there are people who have the

00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,830
resources to do it and if you do have

00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,310
you know if if Drupal 8 is important

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:57,810
enough for your use case if only if you

00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,039
realize that there's no guarantee that

00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,139
we're not going to break your stuff

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,680
every single day or every single month

00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:06,029
and if you're a small organization or if

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,460
you really your only goal is to make a

00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:11,159
new site if it you're looking at the

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,500
next hour live site within the next you

00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:15,029
know two to six months then you should

00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,240
still use Drupal 7 fills these cases a

00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:20,490
triple seven is also awesome great some

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,229
some are some tube two other quick

00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,380
questions first one is going to be for

00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:26,669
Larry in the next 14 for ng so one of

00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:30,930
the question is why does it take so long

00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:33,479
to to develop your blades Larry you give

00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,990
me this question yeah like what's your

00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,000
take

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,909
so there's a couple of factors that go

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,080
into determining the length of any given

00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:45,940
Drupal release cycle I think one of the

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,310
largest contributors is simply

00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,470
uncertainty about it the traditional

00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:52,750
release process has been version of

00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:55,029
Drupal comes out we celebrate we all

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:57,940
start working on the new one and we keep

00:08:55,029 --> 00:09:01,029
doing that until drees decides it's time

00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:03,610
and then we try and slow everything down

00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:08,470
again with feature freeze and betas and

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:10,420
so forth that means there's a lot of new

00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:13,149
work that's getting done that we want to

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,010
finish is also we don't know how long we

00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:18,220
have so people have small plans big

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:20,140
plans they don't line up and with each

00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,360
new version of Drupal that creates a

00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:25,330
longer and longer cycle because each

00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,180
version of Drupal takes longer for older

00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:30,810
versions to port to it in Drupal 8 in

00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:33,100
particular we had an awful lot to do and

00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:36,070
we decided it was time to really

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:39,399
modernize the entire code base and you

00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:41,380
know as a just said Drupal 8 didn't

00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:43,540
really get off the ground until 2012

00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,360
which means we've jumped forward about

00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,520
eight years of development and evolution

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,060
the PHP world in two years which is

00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,860
pretty damn amazing but that is a lot of

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:58,300
work to get done and there's a lot of

00:09:53,860 --> 00:10:00,100
fallout from that sooo just clean up for

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,010
those who is at the core conversation we

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:06,520
had yesterday this time slots on the new

00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:08,020
release cycle okay a few people go out

00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,079
to the video for that we are changing

00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:13,120
the release cycle for Drupal 8 in part

00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:15,190
to address exactly this question where

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,160
every version gets longer and longer and

00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:20,230
longer so for drupal aids whenever eight

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,720
point 0 comes out we are then going to

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,000
start doing monthly bug fix and security

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,730
releases as we do now but not open

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,820
drupal 9 instead we're going to start

00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:33,850
work on 8.1 which will be a feature

00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:36,459
edition not api breaking release and

00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,560
that's targeted to come out about six

00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:40,990
months after eight point zero point zero

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,089
and then six months after that and 8.2

00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:45,820
where we'll be able to add functionality

00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:48,010
improve the UI

00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,380
potentially add modules but not take

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:52,330
things away not strip out api's not

00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,780
break modules that are using the system

00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:58,140
in its supported fashion and hopefully

00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,430
that will give us a much smoother

00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,620
evolution going forward so we don't have

00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:04,000
this huge boom-bust cycle for court

00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,950
developments we have a much more gradual

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,360
cycle and then we get to Drupal I and we

00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,010
can focus just on those things that have

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,650
to be API breaks and that becomes a much

00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:14,530
sort of shorter cycle as well so that's

00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:17,560
that's the current plan and yes I said

00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:20,410
the word plan there's another question

00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,840
Larry but it's a little early to talk

00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:25,090
about Drupal nine but the question is so

00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,920
with these changes what does that mean

00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:29,890
for Drupal 90 thing the development

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:33,100
lifetime or cycle will be shorter as it

00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:36,220
relates to Drupal 9 you asked me to

00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:42,310
predict the future we want to you

00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:45,820
accountable I know you and my hope I'll

00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:48,610
put it that way my hope is that the time

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:51,400
that Drupal 9 development is open their

00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:55,480
9.0 development is open will be a lot

00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:58,390
smaller than when eight was open I'm

00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,820
thinking a year or less because we'll

00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,440
focus just on those architectural

00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,140
changes or those cleanup changes that

00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,670
are going to break api's rather than hey

00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,110
developments open let's throw in all the

00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,960
new features we can think about just

00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,570
enable new features given that we're not

00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,450
gonna start on Drupal 9 for some time

00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:18,730
9.0 may still be four years after 8.0

00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:21,700
but we won't have had a completely

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:24,040
frozen based system in that time we'll

00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,840
be able to do incremental improvement

00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:29,530
will be able to you know improve the UI

00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:32,440
improve the user experience improve ap

00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:34,750
is without breaking them so it won't

00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,730
feel like this frozen in time moment

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,650
where we've got Drupal 7 out and then

00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,470
nothing changes until this big change of

00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:44,320
eight so we'll probably still see a long

00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:47,530
time between eight and nine but it won't

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,270
feel as long because we'll be able to

00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,760
improve incrementally over time at least

00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:54,550
that's that's my hope and that's my goal

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,010
and we'll see if we can pull it off was

00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,300
your help thank you a couple more

00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,370
questions on the Drupal 8 release

00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,770
management ng

00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:04,650
one of the questions was you know of

00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:06,810
course once we release Drupal 8 you know

00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:08,910
a lot of the contributed modules may

00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:11,520
have to be upgraded um and the question

00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:13,950
is how long do you think it takes or you

00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:24,240
expect it to be to be different this

00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:26,580
time around there we go uh hi can you

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,410
hear me okay yes that gave me an extra

00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:32,940
five seconds to think of my answer so

00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:36,080
that was fine um so the question is

00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:38,370
basically how long do we anticipate

00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,779
contribute it to catch up and then like

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,220
is there anything different about Drupal

00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:45,240
8 verses Drupal 7 in that regard and

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:49,080
kind of ok so in Drupal 7 we know it

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,820
took roughly 12 months for contribute to

00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,490
a state where you could actually build a

00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,230
real site on Drupal 7 and there are a

00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,420
number of different factors that one was

00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:59,610
that minor releases weren't going out

00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,660
because we are minor releases of core i

00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,770
should say weren't going out because

00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,900
you're trying to get them under zero

00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,310
critical bugs and then eventually like

00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,529
you know what let's just start putting

00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,209
them out and then we'll fix the critical

00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:11,550
bugs as we go and that worked much

00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:15,120
better the other reason was that there's

00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:17,880
this whole ecosystem of dependencies so

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,800
when CTools isn't ported yet then views

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,959
can't port yet and if you can't pour yet

00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,300
then commerce can't port yet and so on

00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:26,100
and so on and so on like this I think

00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,770
Drupal 8 is better oh and then the third

00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,970
thing in Drupal 7 oh thanks sorry the

00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,370
third thing in Drupal 7 was that

00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:34,980
although we tried to declare an API

00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:37,500
freeze there was in reality things that

00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,180
we were continuing to change despite

00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,440
that often for good read like while

00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,779
always for good reasons but it's like

00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,570
performance or whatever the problem was

00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:47,400
but the reality was that Drupal 8 or

00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,890
Drupal 7 wasn't really stable for

00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,660
developers to work against until very

00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,860
very very late so most people just said

00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,800
you know what whatever i'm just going to

00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,300
wait until it's out and then start so

00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,450
the three ways that Drupal 8 is hoping

00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:02,670
to combat those problems is one the beta

00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:05,040
release has been taking a very long time

00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:06,930
like like just said we're year now past

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,850
API freeze and we still haven't put a

00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:10,800
beta out yet but the reason for that is

00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,089
because we're trying to front load all

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,990
the things that we know are going to

00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:14,779
bite module 2

00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:18,120
lovers and these are also coincidentally

00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:20,339
in a lot of cases the most gnarly evil

00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,250
critical bugs that we have so the hope

00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:26,010
is that both one when that beta comes

00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,510
out it's going to be a stable target

00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,680
that people can code against there are

00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,959
going to be things that come up i'm not

00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,399
going to lie but hopefully those things

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,589
could be a lot more self-contained a lot

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,000
less like removing the earth beneath you

00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:38,820
kind of stuff which is exactly what's

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,380
happening right now so that's a good

00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,970
thing and that means that module

00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,550
developers who do start pouring in beta

00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,870
as opposed to in RC or post release will

00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:48,810
have a much easier time than they did in

00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:50,610
Drupal 7 the second thing is that a lot

00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:52,380
of those when we talk about contribute

00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,180
endin sea ecosystems a lot of those

00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:57,360
things moved into core and Drupal 8

00:15:54,180 --> 00:16:00,029
so've uses in core most of C tools is in

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,100
core now the plugin system and etc we

00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:04,410
moved key modules like date and any

00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,760
reference into core so all a lot of

00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:08,220
these things that other modules built

00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,980
off of are now in corn part of the

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:13,380
things so from day 0 you have no waiting

00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:16,500
time to wait for somebody else to do a

00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,790
bunch of work before you can start and

00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,190
then i would say let the third thing

00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:24,050
that we can do is in drupal 7 we did a

00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:26,880
huge kind of PR that pushed around like

00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:29,130
d7c X so it was like porch or modules

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,079
gay kind of thing you know I think we

00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,640
could ramp that up more and Drupal 8 and

00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,930
be prepared for that and kind of

00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,930
systematic about it something I did

00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,610
after I started aquia back in 2011 but

00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,260
this was after Drupal 7 came out was I

00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,000
kind of made a dashboard of like here

00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,250
are the top here kind of the most

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,140
important like say 30 or 50 modules and

00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,850
then did like you know painstaking like

00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,350
reach out to all the maintainer find out

00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,760
what they needed work with them to find

00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,959
out here the list of release blockers

00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,610
are and so I think we could start that

00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:55,529
work much earlier than we did in Drupal

00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,880
7 and you know work on getting those

00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:58,500
folks funding or work on finding

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,420
organizations that need those things too

00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,459
and get their employees involved in

00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:04,319
helping so that by the time Drupal 8

00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:06,150
ships a lot of this front and work could

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,750
be done so that hopefully you know

00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:11,339
things go so my prediction is that that

00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,230
was a very long answer to a very easy

00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:14,819
question my prediction is that I'm

00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,319
really hopeful we can cut that time

00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:18,360
roughly in half so I would hope that

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,850
within six months of Drupal 8 coming out

00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,530
that we could build real sites on it but

00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:24,270
I want to emphasize that if you're by

00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:26,550
building real sites you're talking about

00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,050
pretty much any basic website you can

00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:30,870
actually do that with Drupal core out of

00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:32,520
the box it's got views it's got fields

00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,540
it's got entities it's got all of the

00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,860
things you need to build out your data

00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,020
models where you're going to run into

00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,910
trouble is if you do highly specialized

00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,559
things like say your drupal commons and

00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,240
you need organic groups that is probably

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,160
not going to be available on day 0 or

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,929
your drupal commerce and you need the

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,550
rules engine that is also probably not

00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:49,620
going to be available days 0 although

00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:51,870
they are fundraising to raise money for

00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,580
that to happen so you should google d8

00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,679
rules and check that out but so that's

00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,870
my prediction is six months roughly and

00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,230
we'll see what happens in you can you

00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:08,700
can all make fun of me when it doesn't

00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:10,320
worry I've made many mispredictions all

00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,809
right let's ask some quick questions to

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,720
both Alex's here let's start with Alex

00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:20,669
be so one of the questions questions

00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:22,860
from grand Krueger is uh how long doing

00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:24,770
a vision to support Drupal 6 and like

00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,510
how are we thinking about supporting

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,830
previous versions of Drupal and I know

00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,690
Alex you've been involved with some of

00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:33,240
these discussion so I don't know if you

00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:35,190
can we may not have definite answers but

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,390
maybe you know talk a little bit about

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:40,320
what we're at and how we're thinking

00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:43,169
about this sure so you know as you know

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,450
historically we've dropped support of

00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:47,669
the we've dropped support of the X minus

00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,290
2 version on the day that you know X

00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:53,040
comes out so for example the day that

00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:56,130
seven got released support for five was

00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,419
cut and that was that's pretty much been

00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,220
throughout Drupal's history so

00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:04,230
effectively what that meant was that if

00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:06,360
you were on a Drupal 5 site then you you

00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,440
either waited to upgrade to seven but

00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,940
then that means the process of upgrading

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,770
from five to seven means that you had a

00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,120
period of time where you were running a

00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:16,440
Drupal 5 site that was potentially

00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:20,460
insecure or you had to go from five to

00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:22,940
six so that you could so that then you

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,350
have time to go from six to seven so

00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:28,679
meanwhile however with Drupal 8 we have

00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:30,300
the migrated module so and we've already

00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:32,490
built a lot of the migration path from

00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,620
six to eight so we're hoping to enable

00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,840
people to be able to upgrade sites you

00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:39,510
know from to migrate sites from six to

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,929
eight and at the same time Drupal 6 is

00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,759
obviously

00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:43,440
very successful release of Drupal like

00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,720
it has much more adoption than drupal 5

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,289
did and adoption by organizations that

00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:52,350
really like must you know can't run an

00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:53,850
insecure version of Drupal so to enable

00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:57,360
that we are trying to find a way to

00:19:53,850 --> 00:20:00,590
support Drupal 6 you know long enough to

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,610
allow a viable migration to to Drupal 8

00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,100
we have where it's been a long

00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:06,299
discussion with the security team and

00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,990
with other sort of key stakeholders in

00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:09,990
fact we're going to have a discussion

00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,460
tomorrow to kind of keep that going so

00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,139
what you know the current proposal

00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,869
that's on the table based on that

00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:16,830
batteries proposed based on a lot of

00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:20,309
feedback from a lot of different

00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:22,980
stakeholders is to continue security

00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:25,619
support of Drupal 6 for one year after

00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:28,230
eight point o is out with the

00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:29,610
expectation that that is both enough

00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,259
time for there to be a truly viable

00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,850
migration path from six to eight meaning

00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:36,929
contribute enough contrib modules are

00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:38,759
ready and and migrate path the migrate

00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:41,759
module and all the migrations have been

00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:46,019
you know well tested by early adopting

00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:47,190
organizations you know so that's that's

00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:48,389
the nice thing about one year and the

00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,619
other nice thing about one year is that

00:20:48,389 --> 00:20:51,119
that sort of works well with

00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:53,460
organizational funding if people know

00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,869
before Drupal 8 is out that it's going

00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,980
to be supported for one you know that

00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:57,090
triple six is going to be supported from

00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:00,090
one year after eight is out then that's

00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:02,429
enough time to sort of get a site

00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,509
upgrade or rebuild or whatever it is you

00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:06,480
know funded through through

00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:08,039
organizational funding channels so

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,929
that's what we would like to do but

00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:11,669
there's challenges in doing that its its

00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:13,980
its burden for the security team it's

00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:16,259
its burden for there's the question of

00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,490
you know what about contribs and people

00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:18,629
on the security team that also need to

00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,899
put out security announcements for

00:21:18,629 --> 00:21:23,549
contribs so those are the kinds of

00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:26,070
issues we're still working out we've

00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:28,429
we've made I think some progress and

00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:30,809
figuring out how we can accomplish this

00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:32,490
without it being more burden on the

00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:34,649
security team or by taking by moving the

00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,529
burden around basically so making making

00:21:34,649 --> 00:21:38,610
more sort of core maintain errs also

00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:40,230
take more of the responsibility of

00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:41,639
fixing security bugs that are discovered

00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,490
by the security team whereas in the past

00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:47,009
like the security team would would both

00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:48,419
value no verify the bug but then also do

00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:49,830
the majority of the work in fixing yet

00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:51,240
trying to find a way to shift more of

00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:53,080
the fixing responsibility onto the

00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,880
project maintain errs and corn

00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,200
Tanner's so those are the kinds of

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,150
discussions we're having so it's not

00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,430
something that's an official policy yet

00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,720
but that's the the current proposal

00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:05,470
that's on the table and as long as we

00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:08,950
can get buy-in from the security team

00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,270
and by and from you know figure out a

00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,530
way that makes it work for contributing

00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,940
Tanner's or figure on a policy around

00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,220
how contribute a nurs can do it then

00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:18,150
that's what we're hoping to achieve

00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:21,070
awesome thank you Alex the other Alex

00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:23,650
Alex pots there's a couple of questions

00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,780
around the amount of change is

00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:28,750
reintroduced from going from seven to

00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:31,000
eight and you know one of the questions

00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:34,300
is do you have any wise words for

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,400
developers that need to go from from

00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:39,490
seven to eight and also another question

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,610
is do you think we made too many changes

00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:44,530
maybe and so I know you haven't seen

00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:47,170
this question before so we're putting

00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:49,000
people on the on the spot here and I'm

00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:52,240
effectively giving him 10 more seconds

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,190
to think but and you know if somebody

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:58,330
else wants to chime in you're welcome to

00:22:54,190 --> 00:23:00,790
as well okay so going back to the to the

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:04,210
first part of the question if you're a

00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:06,130
module developer how difficult is it

00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:09,340
going to be to port your modules to

00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:10,990
Drupal 8 well fortunately there's

00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:13,360
there's a lot of great work that's been

00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:16,270
going on with with some automated tools

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,580
to help people move their modules

00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:21,580
there's also a lot of great examples in

00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:24,970
core of house of a modern module and

00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:26,110
what their needs to do i would say that

00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,760
everyone should look at the contact

00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:30,880
module it's one of my personal favorites

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,560
because it actually has most of the new

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,440
types of things that we have in quarry

00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:37,540
extensively use uses config it uses

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,060
config entities it has a Content entity

00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,830
it has formed so it has all the basis

00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:44,410
basic parts that you need to learn and

00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:47,080
and the concepts of what is in a module

00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:49,480
from Drupal 7 hasn't really changed you

00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,970
have hook menu was it was what it was in

00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,560
Drupal 7 we have a routing file Andrew

00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,780
plate so as long as you're ok with the

00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,250
concepts it's about seeing how they've

00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,170
changed so you can look at the contact

00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,790
module in Drupal 7 and look at the

00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:03,550
contact module and replay and see we'll

00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:06,410
see what's happened and I think this is

00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:09,590
a good thing because PHP has changed

00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:11,900
and PHP is moving quickly so if you look

00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:14,810
at the way the Drupal 7 was it's built

00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:17,540
around PHP four types of ways of working

00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:20,600
drupal 8 is built around PHP 5.3 ways of

00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:22,550
working in 5.4 5.5 and it's it's behavin

00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,290
of developers to stay current just

00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,610
because we've done things always that

00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,140
way doesn't mean that we should continue

00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:29,270
to do them if we want to play in the

00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,130
modern world Therese talks extensively

00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,660
in his keynote about how the web is

00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,640
changing in order to meet those

00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,890
challenges we need to change the way in

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,710
which we code and we have and Drupal 8

00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:42,050
will be better for that I'll a little

00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:45,560
bit more color did that answer as well

00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:47,330
like my personal opinion I think a lot

00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,830
of the concepts remain the same at the

00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:50,840
same time the introduction of

00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:54,200
object-oriented programming and symphony

00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:56,530
is definitely disruptive or you know

00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:00,680
there's also a bit of a move from

00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:03,620
convention based approaches to more you

00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,240
know declarative using configuration and

00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,420
so that that's definitely a conceptual

00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,730
change so while a lot of the concepts

00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:15,140
remain the same other concepts really

00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:17,540
changed in my mind and that that I think

00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:20,870
is definitely disruptive and people will

00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:24,170
have to relearn these parts but I don't

00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:26,120
think we'll make that kind of change in

00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:28,040
Drupal mine I mean this is like a big

00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:31,490
change and it's kind of a it's a bit of

00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:34,190
a one-time-only change and hopefully in

00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,570
Drupal mind the changes will be much

00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:37,850
more incremental there could still be

00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:40,160
many changes but there'll be a little

00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:43,520
bit more incremental in my mind I don't

00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:47,330
know Larry if you agree with that or not

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,010
but yeah one of the things i said in

00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:51,200
Prague Drupal 8 is going to be an

00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:54,050
exceptional release exceptional meaning

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,680
really cool and really rare and has

00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,680
exceptions in it

00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:06,980
no so one on the really great parts of

00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:11,510
schnitzel talk yesterday was when

00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:13,880
amazing built their site in Drupal 8 the

00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:16,760
developers and theme errs are not

00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,560
necessarily core contributors not all of

00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,410
them right so it was kind of their first

00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:23,510
look there first project and he said

00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:26,390
after they finished the project they do

00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:28,610
not want to go back to seven so even

00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:30,590
though there are new things to learn and

00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:33,950
some things to figure out how they

00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:36,500
changed those developers and theme errs

00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:41,090
were really excited and they loved it so

00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:43,640
much once they started using it that is

00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:46,340
great one thing that I've ever doing a

00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:49,340
lot of Drupal 8 training recently either

00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:52,370
on behalf of palantir or on behalf of

00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:54,890
the drupal association and pattern I've

00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:57,650
noticed that I don't think we explicitly

00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:59,000
targeted this but it works out almost

00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,830
everything you do in Drupal comes down

00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,200
to implement an interface and tell

00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:05,270
Drupal about it or extend a base class

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,300
intelligible about it that's ninety

00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:09,920
percent of what you do in Drupal 8 and

00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:12,110
it's a lot clearer what those things are

00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,910
you need to do for the implement

00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:16,160
interface or extend class simply because

00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:17,210
the language gives you a better hint

00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,060
about what is you're supposed to be

00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:21,800
doing so I think once you get over the

00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,870
initial hump of oh there's this class

00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,310
keyword around Drupal 8 will be easier

00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:27,200
to develop for than Drupal 7 that's

00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:29,720
certainly been the experience for most

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,330
people i've talked to great another

00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:39,230
question is from d mouse is the mouse in

00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:40,790
the house my rhymes not not here all

00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:43,040
right so the question is while we're on

00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:45,410
the topic of symphony you know obviously

00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,750
Drupal 8 ass taken advantage of symphony

00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:49,880
quite a bit so sort of more a question

00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:52,430
about the future but the question is

00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:56,000
someday we'll Drupal be you know

00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:57,830
separated into smaller libraries so I

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,160
don't know on the right side of the the

00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:04,130
table here Alex Alex or Larry or or even

00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:06,590
here there's any uh any thoughts on that

00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:08,090
yeah well we started the process of

00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:10,880
thinking about that early on in the in

00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:14,810
the Drupal 8 cycle by by moving to psi 0

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:18,860
which is a name spacing standard that

00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:21,860
was set up by the PHP fig group and and

00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:23,690
we we created a folder in the Drupal i

00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,610
recall component which is exactly for

00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:28,100
stuff that that we think doesn't have

00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:30,170
like dependencies on the whole of the

00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:34,360
Drupal ecosystem that we we might share

00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:38,150
at some point with the rest of PHP and

00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:40,310
we've now started to move our packaging

00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:42,800
and the way in which we commit different

00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:47,090
files to to Drupal to try and support

00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:48,500
that we're not probably even fifty

00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:52,160
percent of the way there we're not using

00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:54,590
composer correctly in core and and there

00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:57,290
are some things to iron out but we're

00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:58,940
definitely thinking about it and yeah I

00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:01,310
think the future I think the future will

00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:03,230
be that when you're developing on Drupal

00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:04,790
you'll you'll be able to create a

00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:06,020
composer file that says I want this bit

00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:07,730
of Drupal list bit this bit and then

00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,200
swap out something come to something

00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,880
completely different from another part

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,930
or not even get the theming engine if

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,700
you don't care about the front end

00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:14,720
because you're doing angle address it

00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,010
just won't be in your distribution

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,680
because the theme engine might be

00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:22,370
separated at that could be our future

00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:25,370
it's all great under on that topic you

00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:28,730
know the symphony Kate Symphony gation

00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:32,930
of Drupal and increasing use of symphony

00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:35,030
also cost or costs on performance

00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:37,550
concerns like you know people a couple

00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:39,170
of questions here are like after rumors

00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:41,540
that the introduction of symphony has a

00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:46,310
negative impact on performance is this

00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:49,490
correct I don't think it's correct but

00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:52,070
I'll caveat that when we introduce

00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:53,180
symphony to Drupal and by that i mean we

00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,920
pulled in many of the symphony

00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:57,290
components to help rebuild the core of

00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:59,300
the system we do that by taking an

00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:00,620
existing known tested architecture

00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,900
throwing it into the middle of the

00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:06,650
system and letting the ripples flow

00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:09,410
where they will and that had the desired

00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:11,300
effect of giving us a base to build on

00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:14,180
and guidelines to follow as we

00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:16,310
refactored everything else around it it

00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:18,560
also meant lots of things have changed

00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:20,450
therefore a lot of the old performance

00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,980
optimizations we made no longer apply

00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:24,090
once we got to the point where okay now

00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,860
we know more or less what the system

00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:29,850
looks like we're able to go in and make

00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:34,230
more optimizations two examples I can

00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:36,050
think of they're not symphony but one of

00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:39,809
the things you've been doing is part of

00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:42,240
Drupal 8 is eliminating global state

00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:45,540
eliminating global variables which in

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:48,960
turn allows us to actually use render

00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:50,670
caching effectively Drupal 7 had caching

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:55,050
support for render raise it was rarely

00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:57,450
used because it rarely worked in Drupal

00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:59,640
8 a lot of the changes we've made make

00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:02,190
it possible to automatically turn on

00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,340
render cashing in a lot more places the

00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:09,210
more we do that the faster things get

00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:13,730
another example picking in Drupal 7 menu

00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:17,130
links and menu routing information were

00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:18,809
tightly coupled which was bad for an

00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:20,730
architectural standpoint but meant we

00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:23,309
could make optimizations like you know

00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:25,980
joining across tables naturally when

00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:27,660
generating menu links those got

00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,309
separated out into separate pieces in

00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,870
Drupal 8 which means we lose that

00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:32,820
optimization which means we have more

00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:35,600
database hits when we're creating menu

00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:39,780
links so we added a component that

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,040
preloads the common routes and you know

00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:44,179
that performance problem went away so

00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:47,940
that kind of optimization is happening I

00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:50,520
actually I was talking to someone from a

00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,929
hosting company yesterday I'm not going

00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,150
to say which one in case they don't want

00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:57,720
me to quote them but they've been

00:31:54,150 --> 00:32:00,030
testing Drupal 8 on their cloud platform

00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,160
and they said it's actually on their

00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:05,940
system now a little bit faster than

00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:07,440
Drupal 7 so the changes for Drupal 8 it

00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:10,860
is larger there are more moving parts

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:13,140
but the structure we've taken gives more

00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:15,510
opportunity for optimization for more

00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,860
opportunity for caching for adding

00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:19,590
efficiency so the more we do that the

00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,910
faster it's going to get and then

00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:24,360
there's a lot more individual sites can

00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:26,280
do so I think Drupal 8 out of the box

00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:29,490
being roughly on par with Drupal 7

00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,420
performance is a Eva below I don't know

00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:34,790
if anyone's going to yell at me for that

00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:34,790
a little and

00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:42,600
okay guilt me for something else um yeah

00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:46,410
I think saying that simply made drupal

00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:48,360
slower is a gross oversimplification new

00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:49,710
architecture means the optimizations are

00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,690
different and we're still making those

00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:56,610
optimizations is the the more accurate

00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:57,930
way of putting it awesome yeah sorry so

00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:01,340
I'd also like to just point out that you

00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:03,800
know Drupal 7 you know alpha 10 was

00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:07,200
several you know times slower than

00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,430
production Drupal 6 so it's it's sort of

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,080
just I think the nature of a lot of

00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:12,330
software projects that you know pre-beta

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,740
software is slower a lot than the

00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:18,180
previous versions production release so

00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:20,070
there's room for optimization and any as

00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,360
far as you know whether drew comparing

00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,220
sort of Drupal 8 performs to Drupal 7

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,150
performance is a you know you sort of

00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,230
have to think about what's the question

00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:27,870
that you're asking you know what

00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:29,940
specific scenario are you testing so for

00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:31,980
example the way in which a lot of the

00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:35,450
optimizations in Drupal 8 come from the

00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:37,650
render caching which is huge and enabled

00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:39,120
you know out of the box and works you

00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,350
know small sites big size you know

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,060
whether the sites just using default

00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,800
database backend for everything or

00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,930
optimized to or whatever it's like

00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,270
those are you know ever every site gets

00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:49,950
to benefit from render caching and so it

00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:53,040
may be the you know we'll see but it may

00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:55,230
be the case that you know a nun primed

00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,210
you know unprimed caches Drupal 8 a

00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:59,640
slower than Drupal 7 but once caches are

00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:01,260
well primed then you know under certain

00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,510
situations and situations that both

00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:05,010
small and large sites encounter and are

00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:06,810
common you know that Drupal 8 ends up

00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:07,950
being faster than Drupal 7 but it's it's

00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:09,530
too soon to tell you know there's a lot

00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:12,030
of optimization left to do and a lot of

00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:13,530
you know figuring out of you know where

00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:16,140
the caching is benefiting us where it's

00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:18,000
creating overhead that we don't want and

00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:20,570
yeah I would agree that it's not it's

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,250
not accurate to blame it entirely on

00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:24,360
Symphony because it's you know there's

00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,470
there's a lot of things you know we

00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,730
built the configuration management

00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:30,870
system that had nothing to do with

00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:33,990
symphony we built you know we massively

00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:36,060
improved the entity API to support both

00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:37,740
better code as well as you know much

00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:41,040
better handling of multilingual sites

00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:42,659
and the ability to do full restful api

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,250
is to support web services I mean and

00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,720
that's all stuff that we wrote you know

00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,889
that that wasn't symphony and that's

00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,349
also where a lot of our perform

00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:51,450
problems are so so I agree that it's

00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:53,159
it's just new architecture new code and

00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:54,750
the time between beta and releases

00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:57,869
optimizing it you know optimizing both

00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:58,829
cache misses and being able to you know

00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:00,450
one of the things that all the

00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:03,450
architecture buys us is the ability to

00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:06,319
cache much more effectively excellent so

00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:09,000
I want to be sensitive of time so a

00:35:06,319 --> 00:35:11,099
couple more quick questions for Kathy

00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,690
but feel free to get your questions

00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:14,670
ready I want to make sure there is time

00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:17,279
to to get you know questions from the

00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:19,529
audience as well not just through the

00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:21,809
blog post with the number of questions

00:35:19,529 --> 00:35:24,420
Kathy around contributing through Drupal

00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:27,180
and you know people wonder as somebody

00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:30,150
was never worked on Drupal core or never

00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:32,069
contributed to Drupal core and I'm eager

00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:36,210
to contribute to Drupal core where do I

00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:38,369
starts how do I get involved we have a

00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:42,720
lot of ways for people to get involved

00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:45,630
um in no particular order come to a

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,430
Drupal event almost all Drupal events

00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,690
have a room somewhere with a table

00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:51,539
somewhere and there are people there

00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:54,089
working and you only have to go and sit

00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:55,920
down at the table with those people it's

00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:58,950
really hard it's scary it's

00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,200
uncomfortable but by the end of the day

00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:03,359
you're going to be excited you're going

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:07,079
to be laughing you may cry a little bit

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:10,140
and then you laugh again I so joy tears

00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:11,549
of joy so going to an event and being

00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:14,849
brave enough to sit down next to

00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:17,759
somebody is so rewarding and it's

00:36:14,849 --> 00:36:20,670
accessible and the other thing if you

00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:23,490
can't go to an event you can I think

00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:27,660
that same kind of rewarding experience

00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:30,750
you can get on IRC and I know people new

00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:36,029
to contributing who don't understand the

00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:39,559
love of IRC think it's crazy um but it's

00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:43,829
real-time interaction with other people

00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:46,410
and and that's really great so pound

00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:48,779
Drupal to ask just any old questions but

00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:51,420
to contribute you go to pound Drupal

00:36:48,779 --> 00:36:53,180
dash contribute and you can just say hey

00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:56,130
I've never contributed to core before

00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:59,059
what should I do and somebody may answer

00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,059
you and somebody may not

00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:07,770
but that's awesome there are specific

00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:11,300
also ours core office hours the accrue

00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:17,460
of mentors attend and those are

00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:21,150
exceptionally good and another way of

00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:24,660
getting involved could be if you are

00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:27,450
interested in a particular topic find

00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,880
out the people the other people that are

00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:31,620
working on that topic and find out when

00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:34,800
they're meeting we're doing a lot of

00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:36,900
meetings to organize the work on Drupal

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,050
8 and coordinate it and so that's

00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:43,290
another way of interacting with humans

00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:45,300
and and they will bring you along and

00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:46,590
they will you know give you feedback and

00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,800
help you figure out something that's

00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:52,890
good for you to work on so we have oh

00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:56,340
those are the core office hours I do the

00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:57,810
what is my monday night ones and then

00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:01,470
there's a whole bunch of people who do

00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:03,680
the the Wednesday ones um but so for

00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:06,180
example I know that there's an entity

00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:09,840
meeting right like you guys have a

00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:12,690
weekly meeting and and multilingual has

00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,700
a weekly meeting and so kind of figure

00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:17,190
out like what kind of general topic do

00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:21,210
you want you know and when do they meet

00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:23,850
and show up and I'm sure I think the

00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:27,740
other thing that could be less

00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:30,960
terrifying for people might be to try

00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:32,940
drupal 8 like just site build I just

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,590
open up the thing and be like gee if I

00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:37,380
were going to build a Drupal 8 site what

00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:40,050
would I do maybe I would make a page

00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:44,100
right or maybe I would change the site

00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:47,760
name like just anything and yeah simply

00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:51,810
test me is amazing right that's Patrick

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,430
D all the way and has really enabled a

00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:55,080
lot of people to play with this because

00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:57,330
you can have your own version of Drupal

00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,880
8 and you don't you can do it on your

00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:01,890
phone you guys can do this right now all

00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,690
right drew you can admin Drupal 8 on

00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:06,600
your phone and you don't have to have a

00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:09,090
local you know developments set up or

00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,790
anything my one bit of advice for simply

00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:12,510
test me is if you log in you get to play

00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:14,550
with your site for

00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:17,010
three and a half hours versus only an

00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:19,350
hour if you're anonymous so anyway I

00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:22,950
think that would really also contribute

00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:26,280
to core just firing it up and trying it

00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:27,780
does contribute to core and then if you

00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,180
want to take the next step you can you

00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:32,100
know look for a bug when you find one

00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,720
and if you can't find an issue earning

00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:40,500
existence just open one that would be

00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:43,350
hugely helpful I was excellent thank you

00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:45,540
that's great so let's open it up to

00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:47,280
people in the audience again if you have

00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:50,730
a question please walk up to the mic so

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:54,240
we can record it for other people to to

00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:56,820
listen to so maybe quickly introduce

00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:00,180
yourself before you ask the question i'm

00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:04,520
ryan from vietnam where do we go to

00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:07,380
quickly see that list of beta-blockers

00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,790
you can go to the Drupal core issue

00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:11,010
queue which I'm sure everyone has in

00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:13,170
their autocomplete drupal.org / projects

00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:15,540
with issues less search such Drupal and

00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:17,550
then you search for the beta-blocker tag

00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:21,000
is it worth as issue tags is one of beta

00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:24,060
blocker so these these 15 issues are the

00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,370
gnarly scary well some of them aren't

00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:28,200
scary but a lot of them are scary issues

00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:30,960
that we need to solve in order to get

00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:33,720
that bit out so Drupal it orgs project

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,730
issues search Drupal and then search for

00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,440
the beta blocker tag or if you like go

00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:38,970
to the you know the Drupal core page you

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,470
can click through it but you know

00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:48,900
everyone everyone has this in their auto

00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:50,160
complete but good i would add we can do

00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,750
that that's a very good idea i'll do

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,330
that and the second thing is also in

00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:55,980
addition to this you can also um not

00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:57,210
just the beta blockers but the other in

00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:03,140
addition to these 15 issues there's

00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:05,490
another 82 that are also um critical on

00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:06,930
blocking release although some of them

00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:08,040
are targeted for beta some of them are

00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:10,080
not but they're not blocking the beta

00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,580
and if you have these contributor links

00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,410
on your drupal.org dashboard you so you

00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:15,720
can see I have my your dashboard tab on

00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:17,040
drupal org you can see there's a link

00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,510
right there to the critical bugs and the

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,880
critical tasks and all the beta blockers

00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:22,830
are in those lists because every single

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,080
one of them is critical not sure it was

00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:26,490
a legit question or you're trying to say

00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:32,190
you need to make it

00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:33,690
easier to find debatable we should

00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:37,980
probably make it a lot easier for people

00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:41,040
to find that list okay go ahead k van

00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:42,869
valkenburg from own sourcing a lot of us

00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,470
are working pretty hard on documentation

00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:48,780
and I think you know the vision that

00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:50,970
we're working under might be a little

00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:54,869
bit out of date is anybody here able to

00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:57,990
articulate any revisions to the notion

00:41:54,869 --> 00:42:00,690
of documentation yeah so that's a really

00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:02,490
great question in the past what we had

00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:04,740
is documentation team lead which is a

00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:06,240
person and more or less that person

00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,700
would burn out after some period of time

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,440
between six months and two years what

00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,540
we've moved to now is a as an actual

00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,650
governance structure similar to like the

00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,700
technical working with the community

00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:17,010
worker if there's actually documentation

00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:19,830
working group which is Betty colix

00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:22,560
Jennifer hodgdon Joe Chandalar from

00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:24,420
lillibet and Lee hunter who was the

00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,650
other the former documentation team lead

00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:29,250
so now it's a working group that manages

00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:30,930
that they put out this post on the droop

00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,880
set giblet org slash core group called

00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:34,950
this month and Drupal documentation and

00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,450
this is how I know to find so this is

00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:37,830
this is why we need a Jew voted redesign

00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:40,320
because we're all like I know the URL to

00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:41,760
go to define anyway if you go to a group

00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,830
searchable core that's like a couple of

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,140
posts back in there there's a link to

00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:47,490
their current priorities goals and these

00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,630
kinds of things and it actually is out

00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:50,190
really well it's like this is where

00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:52,170
we've been this is what we're trying to

00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:54,240
do that's the group to get in alignment

00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:55,590
with I think and of those people the

00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,810
only one who I know is here is Joe

00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:59,580
Chandalar so hopefully he'll be at the

00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:02,400
sprint tomorrow he usually leads the

00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:06,300
community meant like the intro to core

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:08,160
session so try and grab him he'd be good

00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,140
person not to else that's that's all

00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,790
written up there very well documented

00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,740
because it's the documentation working

00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:15,300
group and Jennifer Hajin is almost

00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,950
always available in IRC as well and

00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,410
she's a great person to reach out to so

00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:21,630
for those who are perhaps less focused

00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:23,850
on the documentation who might not make

00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:26,850
it to that blog post are there a couple

00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:28,590
of key salient points that yeah good

00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:30,150
good question so there's a groups that

00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:32,550
triplet org slash it's either

00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:33,960
documentation hyphen T more docs team or

00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:35,700
something like that there's a there's a

00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,350
group on groups that jablow tugged for

00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,570
that there's also a twitter account

00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:40,260
drupal docks where they tweet things out

00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:43,050
and announcements

00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:44,970
so yeah if you're into and and all those

00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:46,860
monthly post will be cross posted a both

00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:48,210
of those resources as well so yeah if

00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:50,880
you're into documentation and you want

00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:52,050
to get started there I will say it's a

00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,790
wonderful time to get involved in

00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:55,680
documentation because there's really no

00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:58,470
one taking strong leadership in that

00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,990
right now so you literally can do almost

00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:02,910
anything and be super helpful right now

00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:05,160
you're not going to step on anyone's

00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:07,560
toes nobody's going to be offended just

00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:09,030
jump in do stuff but yeah I would say if

00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,230
you can do it in concert with what the

00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:16,200
documentation working groups trying to

00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:17,820
do that would be the ideal thing so you

00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,720
know we said documentation right but

00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,070
that means a whole bunch of different

00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,410
things to different people right

00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:25,620
sometimes those are pages on drupal.org

00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:27,660
right like the api's documentation that

00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:31,410
people have been putting up is really

00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:33,150
excellent there's also a really great

00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:36,060
efforts going on to improve the

00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:38,000
documentation in the source code right

00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:42,090
so there's a lot of different

00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,220
documentation things available if I

00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:47,190
could also plug tour module in core is

00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:50,070
awesome we need more people writing good

00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:51,660
tours I believe Lee Rowland alara line

00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:54,300
is trying to coordinate stuff around

00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:56,190
that so if you want good built-in

00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,500
tutorials in Drupal itself or in a

00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:00,930
module itself that's another excellent

00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:05,970
place where we do need people working on

00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:08,190
it tour marshal tou oh you are oh if you

00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:11,490
haven't use tor model that's awesome it

00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:13,680
gives you it's a way to define very

00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:15,630
simply a walkthrough for a given screen

00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,850
so in court right now the only place

00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:20,310
that's used is views but if you go to

00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:22,200
the views page in Drupal 8 today up in

00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:23,760
the top right corner there's a trigger

00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,440
for it and then it gives you pop up

00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,990
balloons explaining what each part of

00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,490
the display does you can click Next to

00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:30,600
see what the next part is it will walk

00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:35,390
you through what you're supposed to do

00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:35,390
it's a wonderful wonderful thing

00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:45,300
alright well just maybe them demos it we

00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:48,450
can take the next question hi Zach

00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:50,520
slammer my introduction is kind of

00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:52,830
encapsulated in my question going back

00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:56,100
to how someone can contribute in the

00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:58,440
past few years I've moved my focus from

00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:00,870
coding and development more to that of a

00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:04,530
system administrator project manager

00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:07,590
role for edu based research center how

00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:10,440
either tomorrow or in general other than

00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:13,110
providing test environments resources

00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:16,740
some of that what can I use my current

00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:20,030
strong skill set for tomorrow at the

00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:23,340
sprint or in general to help contribute

00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:25,350
yeah that's an excellent question so if

00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:27,120
you're if you've kind of transcended

00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:29,400
development you're more into sobs and

00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:32,150
sorry Deb opcion even know the words but

00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:35,100
anyway transcendence is the right yeah

00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:37,080
ran away screaming from I don't know but

00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:39,390
yes so if you're more into like Linux e

00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:41,180
things and stuff like that it's actually

00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:44,370
a really great time to get involved um

00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:45,930
Neil drum is over there he leaves the

00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:47,490
drupal.org software working group as

00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:49,200
well as a triple-dog infrastructure

00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:51,840
working group and I know tomorrow there

00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,610
will be drupal.org Sprint's going on

00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,260
with members of the infrastructure team

00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:57,150
and some big projects that they're

00:46:55,260 --> 00:47:00,750
working on are like revamping the test

00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:03,390
bot to be all Jenkins coker blah blah in

00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:05,670
other words but you know like very using

00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:06,870
a lot of like modern infrastructure best

00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:08,640
practice technology as opposed to

00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:10,530
building our continuous and integration

00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,060
environment on Drupal which is like it's

00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:14,310
cool it can do that but probably not

00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,750
very smart so there's a lot of that kind

00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:18,030
of stuff happened there trying to do a

00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:20,250
lot of work to puppet eyes the existing

00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:22,200
configuration and make it more useful so

00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:23,640
it's actually a really exciting time to

00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,620
be involved on the Jupiter

00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,180
infrastructure side if you're if you

00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:30,270
know if the idea of working on a site

00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:32,100
with about 40,000 authenticated users at

00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:33,870
any given time and you know like a

00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:35,340
hundred fifty different domains that we

00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:36,900
have to manage i mean it's it's pretty

00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:38,820
cool and there's actually starting to be

00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,560
some real organization and leadership

00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:42,540
behind Jupiter org so that would be my

00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:45,240
recommendation to you so don't love my

00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:48,690
coding skill rustiness shy me Oh

00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:51,360
from tomorrow absolutely not yeah so

00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:54,480
that's true for anything not just for

00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:57,080
DevOps stuff yeah right so tomorrow at

00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,310
the sprint you don't have to be a coder

00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,330
you don't even have to know like if even

00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:02,220
if you are a coder brick you're like oh

00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:04,410
I don't know PHP Drupal's made my PHP no

00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:07,890
that's right like it doesn't matter who

00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:12,390
you are right we have something where

00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:14,520
you can help and be productive one other

00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:16,980
suggestion if you have both you know

00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,960
developer skills as well as cysts

00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:20,430
develop skills like one area where you

00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,950
could get involved where we need a lot

00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:26,400
of help is a performance testing so in

00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:28,320
installing people know like definitely

00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,119
we need people to benchmark and profile

00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:36,900
drupal and and figure out where we can

00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:41,850
make it faster thank you guys thank you

00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:44,930
great question my name is John I've been

00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:49,710
a drupal lurker for about five years and

00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:52,080
about this time for drupal 7 question

00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:54,530
came up as to whether the automatic

00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:57,510
testing mechanism was going to include

00:48:54,530 --> 00:49:00,210
automated load testing and performance

00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:04,200
testing so if the changes made we can

00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:07,320
know within 24 hours rather that's going

00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:11,700
to you know cause problems down the road

00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:13,350
and I don't know if we have the time to

00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:18,210
actually do something about that I just

00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:19,680
heard a couple mentions of testing so so

00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:22,830
I mean we've been dreaming about that

00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:25,910
for years but I don't think we have that

00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:29,310
today we don't have it yet but the

00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:30,720
Jeremy Thorson the maintainer of our

00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:32,310
automated testing infrastructure is

00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,170
currently working with the drupal

00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:36,090
association to sort of modernize the

00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:38,040
texting architecture and once that

00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:41,100
projects done I think that we'll be able

00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:43,830
to enable a lot more different kinds of

00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:45,390
automated testing you know performance

00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:48,570
testing one testing in different

00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:51,960
environments front end testing more

00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:56,119
behavior testing rather than so there's

00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,119
there's a lot of potential there not

00:49:56,210 --> 00:50:01,600
necessarily project

00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:03,100
so it's jeremain their audience I don't

00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:10,170
think so you see at the conference yes

00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:10,170
yes yeah so go go look for Jeremy yeah

00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:15,960
microphone I can repeat it to

00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:21,210
yeah so so what this is neil drum over

00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:24,220
here he works for the drupal association

00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:25,540
so what he said is that Jeremy Thorson

00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:28,390
will be also at the sprint tomorrow

00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:30,010
sprinting on that new architecture so

00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:31,990
look for a sign that says drupal.org

00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:33,490
testing infrastructure or architect or

00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:35,890
something like that or just the words

00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:37,120
drupal.org if you're interested in

00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:38,560
helping out with that because we could

00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:44,200
we could definitely use more people

00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:47,260
working on that awesome my name is

00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:50,770
deviation from a source in Boulder my

00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:53,280
questions for trees I'd like to know

00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:57,220
your vision eyes I know we saw your

00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:59,920
keynote two days ago and it was awesome

00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:02,950
thank you ok some of it did seem like

00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:05,650
it's pie-in-the-sky a lot to achieve

00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:07,750
with what we're trying to do so and I

00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:09,550
know a little bit let me back up and I'm

00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:11,020
near the drupal 1 i've been with to

00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:15,070
prefer for a year i used to be a java

00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:17,320
guy I have heard a little bit about

00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:19,330
where drupal 8 is going and why is going

00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,640
that way but I don't quite understand I

00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:23,620
I want I want to hear maybe a one-line

00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:27,190
mission statement from you and why you

00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:29,200
did certain things like a symphony I've

00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:31,300
heard that object oriented programming

00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,010
is coming back I know that there are a

00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:36,310
lot of skeptics so if you can address

00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:40,060
them yeah it's interesting like if you

00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:41,650
look at the history of websites like

00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:43,750
there's definitely been an increase in

00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:45,430
complexity I mean building a website

00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:49,030
five years ago it was completely

00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:50,500
different and building it today and five

00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:52,680
years ago was completely different than

00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:55,480
10 years ago right and so there's this

00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:57,670
acceleration of innovation on the web

00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,980
like you know i feel like when i started

00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:01,360
drupal in around two thousand i feel

00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:02,830
like i could wrap my arms aren't

00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:05,470
everything that was happening on the web

00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:08,440
like I saw Oh somebody's working on RSS

00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:10,450
and with implement RSS and I felt like I

00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:13,630
could see everything was going on on the

00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:15,730
web at the time and so today of course I

00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:17,950
mean there's you know things launching

00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:20,320
every day new start ups new services

00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:23,440
there's so much stuff going on and so I

00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:25,690
think the only way to stay relevant in

00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:29,290
that future where it's only going to

00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:31,030
accelerate is to be a platform it's to

00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:34,090
be a platform that other people

00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:36,640
and organizations can innovate upon and

00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:38,050
build these kinds of integrations you

00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:41,020
know with these all these other things

00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:43,300
that are launching and a lot of that

00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:46,180
we've done with Drupal 8 is rethinking

00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:48,580
our platform and making it so that we

00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:50,770
can integrate easier and innovate faster

00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:54,010
so if you look at Drupal 8 there's all

00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:56,710
that much new and user facing stuff

00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:58,810
compared to seven but hopefully it will

00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:01,240
be a platform that allows the

00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:04,210
contributed module space to really

00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:05,950
accelerate to build more modules that

00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:09,460
integrate with more different systems

00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:12,700
and to do that easier and better than

00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:16,150
we've been able to do so in the past and

00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:18,220
I think and so it's interesting because

00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:20,020
we don't really know yet if that's going

00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:21,880
to be the case you know but there's

00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:23,890
anecdotal evidence from talking to

00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:25,630
different contributed Marshall

00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:27,220
maintained there's that it that it will

00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:29,650
be like I talked to the media module

00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:31,270
team yesterday and they were very

00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:33,940
excited about Drupal 8 and how it

00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:36,130
actually simplifies their module so it's

00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:39,580
a it's a good early indicator in my mind

00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:42,280
that the contribute module space will

00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:45,580
flourish on top of Drupal 8 and I think

00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:48,010
that will so you know make make from I

00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:50,560
mean that's great news for Drupal and

00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:53,530
our ability to stay relevant because I

00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:55,180
don't think I think the only way to stay

00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:57,370
relevant is actually to be an open

00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:59,440
source platform and I think all of the

00:53:57,370 --> 00:54:01,540
proprietary vendors are unable to keep

00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:04,480
up with the speed of innovation of the

00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:06,880
web the only strategy that they have is

00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:09,430
to unbundle and to build these

00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,310
integrations as well but it's impossible

00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:14,470
to build you know like if you think

00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:16,180
about Drupal if 20,000 something modules

00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:18,420
like you know I mean no proprietary

00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:25,660
company can build that amount of modules

00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:28,729
or very few will be able to so welcome

00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:31,069
hi my name is rife I'm working for for a

00:54:28,729 --> 00:54:33,049
dribble shop and Germany and my question

00:54:31,069 --> 00:54:37,699
is what is the state of penance and

00:54:33,049 --> 00:54:41,239
parents everywhere for Drupal 8 I do not

00:54:37,699 --> 00:54:46,309
know myself and I one knows to enter

00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:53,769
anyone in the audience may be like I can

00:54:46,309 --> 00:54:53,769
try to speak to that so there's I can Oh

00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:25,770
so just to repeat that for the recording

00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,200
um and for people who couldn't quite

00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:32,160
hear there is a sprint on lay outing in

00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:33,570
general in Zurich next week was it and I

00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,340
think you can probably I think that this

00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:37,380
is probably another shop called MV

00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:38,160
systems if you if you look on their blog

00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,660
you'll probably see some more

00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,550
information about it so they're going to

00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:44,070
talk about sort of a outing ecosystem

00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:45,900
panels and similar models interpret and

00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:47,820
also right now looking I just want to

00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:50,820
look at the repository for panels itself

00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:52,970
and it does not appear to have an 8x

00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:56,580
branch open right now but I know that

00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:57,720
obviously layouts is is the big the next

00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:00,090
big thing that we're going to want to

00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:03,240
put into along with media maybe into

00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:05,340
like in decor and we could think maybe

00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:07,350
in 8.2 8.3 or something like that so

00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:09,210
this is a very important part of Drupal

00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:11,190
and I'm sure that there will be if it's

00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:13,230
not a you know exactly the panels we've

00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:15,870
known there will be a robust solution in

00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:19,050
Drupal 8 just as they suddenly a little

00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:21,060
less dire um I happen to know I happen

00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:22,830
to know that Tim Plunkett is working on

00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:25,050
a port of the page manager module which

00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:26,910
is the thing that powers all of the

00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:28,500
panel's equals previously part of C

00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:30,360
tools that right as the only part of

00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:33,330
CTools it didn't make it in core more or

00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:35,670
less and um and it's it's working he

00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:38,340
like has a video it's like it's doing

00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:41,010
stuff and it's it's awesome there's also

00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:43,470
still work happening in core that's not

00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:46,110
building layout but trying to improve

00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:48,290
the api's that layout type tools are

00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:51,560
going to use to make it easier to build

00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:54,210
panels or it's a successor or other

00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:55,470
approaches to that problem space so

00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:57,480
that's an area i'm still working on is

00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:59,520
just trying to line up some of those

00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:03,390
dominoes and api is to simplify that

00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:11,820
process for contribu all right we have

00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:14,550
two more minutes and two questions so I

00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:17,250
had the pleasure of upgrading about

00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:20,520
20 of our sites from six to seven about

00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:23,640
two years ago and yeah we had a just a

00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:25,560
module it was fun so I believe I used

00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,750
the coder module I think to get me most

00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,940
of the way there so my question is as

00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:32,880
far as seven to eight what's the

00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:33,720
suggested method for converting the

00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,400
modules and then more importantly

00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,900
because there's been such a drastic

00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:39,000
difference between seven and eight

00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:40,339
verses six to seven how far does that

00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,650
actually get you

00:57:40,339 --> 00:57:43,910
yeah that's a great question so the

00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:45,559
question is are there any like tools

00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:49,729
that can help expedite the the porting

00:57:45,559 --> 00:57:51,380
process yes so in Drupal 6 it was called

00:57:49,729 --> 00:57:52,640
Deadwood and Drupal 7 it was called

00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:54,769
coder upgrade it was moved into the

00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,410
coder module and Drupal 8 coder wants to

00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:58,969
kind of just be coder again and the

00:57:57,410 --> 00:58:00,589
coder upgrade maintained errs didn't

00:57:58,969 --> 00:58:03,200
have really any interest in continuing

00:58:00,589 --> 00:58:05,089
down the open-source GPL path so at

00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,859
aquia we need our hackathon in February

00:58:05,089 --> 00:58:08,960
we built a thing called drupal module

00:58:06,859 --> 00:58:11,089
upgrader we figured maybe we'll just

00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:13,999
call it what it is so people might find

00:58:11,089 --> 00:58:15,619
it um I will say it's not very well

00:58:13,999 --> 00:58:17,539
maintained at the moment just because

00:58:15,619 --> 00:58:19,309
like we're not in a debate I yet so

00:58:17,539 --> 00:58:20,719
there's not really there's pointed

00:58:19,309 --> 00:58:22,789
working on it but it's like things are

00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:24,739
still changing so if you're interested

00:58:22,789 --> 00:58:26,509
in working on that I would love to talk

00:58:24,739 --> 00:58:29,329
to you I was sort of the team lead on

00:58:26,509 --> 00:58:31,249
that um I think what it does currently

00:58:29,329 --> 00:58:34,369
is as of three months ago or whatever

00:58:31,249 --> 00:58:36,589
februari was it would convert your info

00:58:34,369 --> 00:58:39,559
file convert your blocks to plugins

00:58:36,589 --> 00:58:41,839
convert your menu hook menu to some

00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:43,880
routes stuff it was you know it was demo

00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:45,950
quality it wasn't like a complete but

00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:47,900
the foundations are there and it's built

00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:50,779
on something called PHP code sniffer so

00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:52,160
you actually get IDE integration telling

00:58:50,779 --> 00:58:54,469
you this is what you need to change in

00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,969
this so like yeah it's pretty cool but

00:58:54,469 --> 00:58:57,680
it's it's very early so I don't want to

00:58:55,969 --> 00:59:03,440
I want to don't wanna oversell it but

00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:05,299
yeah I think very soon right yeah yeah

00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,619
but I guess I did want to put a plug in

00:59:05,299 --> 00:59:07,640
for that because the people in this room

00:59:06,619 --> 00:59:08,900
of the people who are going to need it

00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,880
and they're also the people best poised

00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:12,890
to help develop it so I think you know

00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,420
if we all as reporting our modules kind

00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:16,069
of try to write a rule or two or even

00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:17,930
just it's cool you can actually just

00:59:16,069 --> 00:59:19,609
write a notification so just like here's

00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:21,769
a thing you should read about it over

00:59:19,609 --> 00:59:23,479
here or you can actually try and fix it

00:59:21,769 --> 00:59:25,160
and I think if we all just you know

00:59:23,479 --> 00:59:26,960
maybe at the next drupalcon just

00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:29,089
hammered on this and like got a bunch of

00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,380
notifications up that alone would be

00:59:29,089 --> 00:59:32,180
awesome because for your particular

00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:34,519
module it could tell you these are the

00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:36,670
out of the 300,000 change notices either

00:59:34,519 --> 00:59:38,960
the 40 that means something to you

00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:40,160
drupal module up comes up here on the

00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,809
screen and I can put it in the session

00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:45,550
notes drupal module upgrader although

00:59:41,809 --> 00:59:48,190
Reuters I'm a project there's 103

00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:51,460
oh okay all right real quick okay

00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:54,460
there's also the Drupal 8 console

00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:57,370
scaffolding module from hey-zeus

00:59:54,460 --> 01:00:00,660
Malema's J and will leave us so check

00:59:57,370 --> 01:00:03,340
that out too thank you one more question

01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:05,470
we're out of time so I don't wanna make

01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:07,120
people I hope this will be sort of short

01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:09,580
my name is Mark I've work in the

01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:12,580
Washington DC area where obviously do

01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:16,120
both very strong presence and I was very

01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:18,070
curious about I loved it just here if

01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:20,350
there were any lessons learned for the

01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:23,110
Drupal organization from the

01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:25,360
healthcare.gov Fiasco which are you know

01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:28,030
unfortunately we we didn't get to work

01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:29,980
on who's curious why Drupal did not have

01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:31,690
a role in healthcare com woodard have

01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:32,860
gone better yeah I think that was

01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:35,110
actually one of the questions I was

01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:36,850
submitted as well as he yeah sorry i

01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:41,350
didn't yeah I didn't get to that

01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:43,630
question um yeah I mean I think you know

01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:45,670
but there's so many lessons learned i

01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:47,200
think from healthcare.gov like all the

01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:49,660
way from you know maybe they should have

01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:51,850
used open source instead of a

01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:55,120
custom-built implementation i believe it

01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:57,190
was all the way to you know software

01:00:55,120 --> 01:01:02,770
methodologies like i don't believe they

01:00:57,190 --> 01:01:05,200
used agile techniques apparently so I

01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:07,360
and also the the people know could have

01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:10,720
worked on it if we could engage the as

01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:13,870
curious why drupal was not selected so

01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:15,220
yeah I don't know to be honest there's

01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:18,550
usually a lot of different reasons

01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:21,070
sometimes it's political but oftentimes

01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:23,230
it's still especially in sort of the

01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:26,770
enterprise and government world it's

01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:28,150
still fear about open source and drupal

01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:31,330
and you know how does it work and does

01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:33,790
it scale and is it secure and for us

01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:35,440
that's all natural to use open source

01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:38,380
but you would be surprised for how many

01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:42,370
organizations it's still a big leap to

01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:45,160
take to actually use open source for

01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:47,560
these kinds of large implementation so I

01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:50,050
think we have to keep evangelizing keep

01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:52,930
promoting the benefits of Drupal and

01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:54,770
open source and then hopefully that will

01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:57,140
solve that problem

01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:58,880
thank you well thanks everyone for

01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:01,130
submitting questions thanks for asking

01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,840
questions also to wrap things up there I

01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:04,070
also wanted to just give you like three

01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:06,860
next steps these are the three things

01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:08,750
that you can do to help us make Drupal 8

01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:10,460
successful and get it done soon and get

01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:11,870
it done beautifully number one comes

01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:13,220
with the Sprint's tomorrow there's a

01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:14,690
full sprint day on Friday there will be

01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:16,160
hundreds of people working together it

01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:17,210
will blow your mind if you haven't been

01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:19,670
to one of our sprints tomorrow

01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:21,290
previously number two is give your

01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:23,510
developers time to play with Drupal 8 if

01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:24,800
you own a shop or if you're working for

01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:27,140
an organization that's looking at it

01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:28,340
give them time to explore it use it

01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:30,140
maybe even give them some time to

01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:33,140
contribute back and think number three

01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:34,910
is if the thought of you know committing

01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:36,350
your own organizations time to Drupal 8

01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:37,760
is like you're just you can't figure out

01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:39,470
how you could fit that into your current

01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:42,350
timeline there's a very simple way that

01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:44,120
you can contribute financially to Drupal

01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:47,600
core development on there's this site

01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:52,790
get tip com that allows you to refresh

01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:54,530
ok total yay whoa sorry I'm kept calm

01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:56,030
there's a team of developers who are

01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:58,520
working on Drupal core these are the

01:02:56,030 --> 01:03:00,560
people who are receiving money from this

01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:03,020
group our developers who are working on

01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:05,000
core either partially or completely in

01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:06,320
their free time they're not being funded

01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,670
by any organization so this is the way

01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:09,800
that you can you can give back and

01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:11,450
contribute and support people who are

01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,710
doing active work even if you don't have

01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:14,860
time to do it yourself thank you very

01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:14,860
