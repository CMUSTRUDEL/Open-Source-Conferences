Description: 
	Speakers: Cottserjoelpittet
The Twig templating engine is in Drupal 8 and has generated a lot of excitement. Many passionate contributors have stepped up during the Drupal 8 development cycle to not only convert Drupal's markup to Twig but also clean up and simplify the theme system as a whole. But what does all this mean to you?

In this session some of your friendly Drupal 8 theme system co-maintainers will walk through the state of Drupal 8's theme system. We'll talk about what's different from Drupal 7 but also walk through some of the internals of different aspects of the theme system and how they might affect your day-to-day work with Drupal.

We'll also talk about some of the exciting ways that Twig and Drupal 8 can be leveraged and built upon to make life better and touch on some opportunities there are in the contrib space.

We're going to talk a lot about code and APIs and look at plenty of PHP, so an understanding of PHP basics will be helpful.

TOPICS INCLUDE:

A high-level overview of the changes to the theme system in Drupal 8.
Some of the goodies that are possible now that we're using Twig as our templating engine.
Using theme hook suggestions to cut down on custom code and have themers thanking you.
Phases of the theme system and where you can step in to alter things.
