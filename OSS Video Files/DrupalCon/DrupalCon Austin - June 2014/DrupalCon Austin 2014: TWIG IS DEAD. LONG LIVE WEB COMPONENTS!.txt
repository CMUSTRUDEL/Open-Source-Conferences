Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: TWIG IS DEAD. LONG LIVE WEB COMPONENTS!
Publication date: 2014-06-05
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: JohnAlbin
-hyperbole-alert- Everyone is excited about Drupal 8's Twig system, but it's already dead to me. end-hyperbole-alert- The W3C is working on a specification for a templating system that is native to the HTML language, called Web Components.

With web components, we'll be able to define and instantiate our own templates from within HTML. We can even create our own custom elements. Best of all, with the Shadow DOM, our templates encapsulate styling (CSS) and behavior (JS) within them, eliminating conflicts and easing integration of multiple building blocks.

There is so much awesome in the Web Components spec, but switching to it will make switching to HTML5 look like a cake walk. There is a lot to do! (And the spec is still unfinished!)

Will Web Components be ready to use for Drupal 9? (dunno.) Will we be ready to use them? (you bet!)

But we have to start planning now and start evolving our current codebase (including Twig) to make the transition easier. By building component-like bundles of CSS, Twig templates, and JavaScript into Drupal 8 (and 9), we can bring the core concepts of Web Components into Drupal right now!

In this session, I'll give a brief demo of Web Components and the Shadow DOM, discuss the benefits, and then we can hash out a plan of attack.

yeah trick is dead long live web

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,809
components I just named it that so that

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,160
I control Morton you know because he'd

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:16,529
been working so hard at getting twitted

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:18,449
into into Drupal 8 and I actually think

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:23,430
that you know adding web components to

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:25,800
like drupal nine maybe would be not

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,960
something that would necessarily replace

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,830
twig it would be more like augmented I

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,149
would think of somehow but that that's

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,680
what I'm gonna have I want to have like

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,120
a big conversation with people about

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,160
stuff because I don't actually have like

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:43,010
a lot of really good answers I have a

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,969
lot of really good questions right so I

00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,980
know that there are bunch of people who

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,730
are not able to tend Austin and want to

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,600
see videos of all the core conversations

00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,600
those people are going to be really

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,710
disappointed with this recording because

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,239
about five minutes into it I'm going to

00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,489
stop talking into the mic and just

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,160
talking with everybody you don't need to

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,390
line up to have the conversation with me

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,390
and talking to the mic we're just going

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,369
to be talking all at once that's what I

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,880
vision sort of old-school core

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:21,650
conversation well that's really annoying

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:21,650
that let me stop it doing that okay yeah

00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:30,320
so I'd tell people that I would give a

00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,670
super brief intro to web components just

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,930
so we're all on the same page even if

00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:37,910
you don't know anything about web

00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:41,390
components right so the I've got these

00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:42,950
some resources here CSS tricks there's

00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,740
an article you can read this is a great

00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,960
article it really gave a really good

00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,540
overview of everything that goes web

00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,150
components org is probably the best

00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,740
place you can go right now to to keep

00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,590
current with things that are going on

00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,000
with web components and then the marks

00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,150
on mom told me about this thing called

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,520
react that Facebook just recently did

00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:07,520
and it's not web components inspected

00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,080
sort of explicitly trying to be an

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,700
alternative to web components because

00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,160
I'm not quite sure that web components

00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:19,460
makes sense because of the Dom heavy

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:20,900
nature of of doing web components

00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,270
requires use of the DOM and the DOM is

00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,340
very sort of heavy heavy system compared

00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,350
to a very lightweight JavaScript system

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,850
which they built with react um I think

00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:31,370
mark is going to come back who's you had

00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:34,670
to go to BBQ for lunch so he's going to

00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,110
be late and then like if you guys have

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,400
more resources I'll just like Adam of

00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:46,600
this slide and then post the slides

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:46,600
later but so

00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:53,510
here's web components org if you went to

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,909
my talked yesterday about design

00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:59,000
components I basically just described

00:02:55,909 --> 00:03:00,079
web components as the spac author sort

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,329
of getting together and saying hey you

00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:04,129
know web developers really like

00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:07,129
templating systems in all those

00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:10,370
handlebars and there's PHP and even ASP

00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:11,799
whatever they like templating systems

00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:15,560
and we we should really add that

00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:20,480
natively to the HTML spec itself so that

00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:22,879
you can basically specify a you know a

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,859
sort of snippet of HTML instead of a

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,930
page of HTML which is kind of what's

00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:29,329
required round now as far as the spec

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:32,090
goes you have these like snippets of

00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:34,840
HTML and JavaScript and CSS or combined

00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:37,700
into this thing called a web component

00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:41,000
and then you can use those as templates

00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:43,670
to you know insert your actual data into

00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,769
those those web components as those

00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:53,780
templating system and it's built sort of

00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:55,760
natively into the HTML spec so web

00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,859
components that org gives a really good

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,430
high level overview of the different

00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:03,560
specs of this because like a lot like

00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,900
the CSS spec is now like eight specs

00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,489
right they're doing the same thing with

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,250
with web components so there's these

00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:11,989
different parts of it custom elements is

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,810
a way that you specify a web component

00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:17,239
and then you actually tell the system

00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:21,049
that you're you're going to name it this

00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:23,599
tag and then you can use that tag name

00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:25,940
you know oh god oh god why didn't the

00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:28,699
client listen to me about carousels tag

00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:35,389
right to to encapsulate your carousel

00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:37,490
right HTML imports are basically a way

00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:39,020
and it's rooms that particular spec is

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,729
like not implemented at all the

00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:44,389
browser's you can sort of see on the

00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:47,690
left here HTML imports not so much but

00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:49,909
it's a way to specify like an external

00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:53,479
resource external to the current page

00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:55,930
that hey that's where my my my templates

00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:55,930
are right

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:04,280
and then this shadow Dom this thing of

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:08,510
course is is already implemented in and

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:10,910
all the browsers and is like the way the

00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:14,420
video tag and a lot of other widgets are

00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:24,500
actually implemented inside the browser

00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:30,140
so yeah like that's my entire talk about

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:32,240
web components right now and in in

00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,730
Drupal we've we've come a long way from

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,170
just the beginning of the system we had

00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:41,300
a dot theme file that had raw PHP and it

00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,220
basically to insert HTML into the system

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,440
then we went to a system called X

00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:52,070
template and finally phb template and

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:56,590
now twig and I I really I'm interested

00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:59,300
in what people think about how do we get

00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:02,540
this new technology this new tech

00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:06,530
templating system that's in HTML and

00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:08,240
integrate that into maybe you know how

00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,860
would we integrate that into contribute

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,230
to jubilate how would we integrate that

00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,910
at a Drupal 9 is that even feasible I

00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,500
mean some the question of whether it's

00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,970
feasible for Drupal 9 is is sort of up

00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,520
in the air because we just have to see

00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:22,400
how far the spec comes with the release

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:31,850
cycle of Drupal 9 and Larry wins Drupal

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:34,240
on coming up yeah so I'm going to move

00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,240
over there

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:48,629
well I use case well I mean the I mean

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,580
we use templates throughout Drupal all

00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:53,970
over the place and the idea is basically

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,979
that that having a sort of native HTML

00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:59,069
implementation of it would be much

00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:02,159
faster just a better way but it's

00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:04,440
basically it would work identical to you

00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:05,669
no way the way you are going to be using

00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:12,389
twig you know that we are currently

00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:17,069
using PHP template where we just we you

00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:22,289
can actually I saw a really interesting

00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:25,199
demo last week where Chris Webber is he

00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:30,210
in here he showed me how he got Drupal

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:33,389
aids rest api and he built a web

00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:35,849
component that pulled out data json data

00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:39,330
out of the the rest api or something

00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:41,789
like that and then used a web component

00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:44,129
to actually display a node you know so

00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:48,569
he like he was editing the node and

00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:52,789
using yeah a custom element that was

00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:52,789
like a node web component

00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,600
yeah um

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,700
yeah i think that the there are is name

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,960
spacing in web components does anybody

00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,700
know the suspect a little bit better and

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,900
knows definitively that that's true i

00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:17,970
can't imagine that there wouldn't be

00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:17,970
named spacing because yeah

00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,940
one thing I should point out is a you

00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:26,450
know they have partial implementation of

00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,800
this and some of the like the chrome

00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:31,920
canary or whatever but then there's a

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,240
bunch of libraries here polymer and x

00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,870
tiger sort of the better one I've never

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,520
even seen this one until today bosonic

00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,740
but these are JavaScript polyfills that

00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,330
allow you to start playing with web

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:46,160
components right now and the browser

00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,160
using it this JavaScript polyfill

00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,240
oh ok

00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,930
by module

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:17,689
right yeah

00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:21,379
so as long as we don't have like PSR one

00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:25,069
style namespaces for our tags I think

00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:27,730
we'll be fine I like to troll Larry

00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:30,730
sometimes too by the way you actually

00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:36,160
yes r 1 is something else oh sorry

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:36,160
Rollie Vale prevail

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,510
I mean presumably contribs that point

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,810
yet

00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,810
but

00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,230
if I set up an image

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,990
javascript

00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,990
right because

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,770
they would see like a stack

00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:25,540
well I mean sergeant on dog tags

00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,580
a browser does not recognize

00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,560
if no

00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,670
will be very clear

00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,090
I think that

00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,690
I

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,600
I don't think we

00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:43,610
what a little bit right

00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:21,889
but when I

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:24,819
when I started thinking okay what we do

00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:24,819
theoretically

00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,890
darlin

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,610
I think we have

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,610
improve our quick

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,240
what

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,540
better support

00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,029
what we do that

00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:00,029
how would we have one

00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,540
complimentary library of

00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,800
the browser

00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,670
left

00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:18,670
with something fun

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,649
so that

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,390
rather than

00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,820
like the door and fender

00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,850
you look at it because

00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,850
like

00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:18,250
and that's something that you know and

00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,250
identity

00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,320
the other thing I wanted

00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:42,730
like very much

00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:45,570
polyfill and it

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,570
discussion around

00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,120
I

00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,910
bye

00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,549
so many grammar

00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,549
and that's what

00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,930
html5

00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,810
proponent

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,820
not gay like not follow the picture

00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,820
all around like that

00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,549
but all that stuff

00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:01,409
year

00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:01,409
of work and back important

00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:18,980
opportunity

00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,980
it is hard behind

00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,320
I

00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:36,739
conversation like this

00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:36,739
very

00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,090
go back

00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,299
thinking about the paper

00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,100
one

00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,580
brother

00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,580
Oh

00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:19,890
family life

00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,890
chrome in this fall

00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:25,470
towards that

00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,470
five

00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:35,409
there are two current ways that electric

00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,090
method element or

00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,370
mark up

00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:07,920
so

00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:11,000
yeah i mean if you're trying

00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,000
currently right now

00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,260
and pull in the data

00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:27,390
ok

00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:27,390
Bilbo

00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,130
is

00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:45,049
where you would do that

00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:48,390
quit right now

00:23:53,929 --> 00:23:57,490
when I said every separate I meant more

00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:57,490
like

00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,590
right like I'm not I

00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,960
hardcore front end early

00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:13,920
where my

00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,920
legenda the conversation is different

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,090
um

00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,540
Oh

00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:55,960
very possible that that will definitely

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,960
happen

00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:06,049
a bigger conversation

00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,690
find all sorts of great

00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:17,869
it falls through

00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:28,869
so that

00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:36,890
like what what the webbing versus what

00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,140
that football

00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:04,450
new things

00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,480
given you are coming up you think but

00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:11,370
it's an encapsulation of existing

00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,370
defined market right

00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:18,840
like all that giant property market that

00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,840
we have to do

00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:22,980
right

00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:27,020
you calculate it so it is like one time

00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:30,160
to tag to of known and understood

00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,160
but a lot of it

00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,510
because of that the browser

00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:48,480
cattle dung nua live defined equal five

00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:00,470
as you're talking about

00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,120
with JavaScript

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,890
it's not a way to

00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:24,669
how are you get

00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:34,670
I try to not

00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:37,929
more revolutionary

00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:44,009
what

00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,009
really just

00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,169
give a better example

00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:53,919
right now there's a new html5 tags

00:30:55,070 --> 00:31:03,259
right that uses the shadow Dom

00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:03,259
in or whatever canary

00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:07,490
my chrome five way up there

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,440
see the shadow Dom you inspect one of

00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:12,650
those dates acres negative html5 date

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,840
picker you actually see the giant markup

00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:17,990
who here is what sing the mark-up at the

00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:20,900
output by the Challenger module if it's

00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:23,179
a lot for a calendar because it requires

00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:25,400
that much right so all of that gets

00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:27,080
encapsulated inside the shadow Dom so if

00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,150
you like right click and inspect that

00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,710
state ticker element you'll see you all

00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:32,710
on that and then it's just

00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:38,380
so it's encapsulated very complex that

00:31:37,549 --> 00:31:41,380
are marked

00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,380
very

00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:38,360
well I mean what is the polymer one is

00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:39,710
written by dual word again yeah so yeah

00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,830
I mean they're definitely thinking about

00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,830
that

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,450
using for that

00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,230
vs like this

00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:08,309
I did a little kinder

00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:14,100
the thing that makes

00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:23,810
the dog

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,810
like three hundred properties on

00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:31,190
anything

00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:31,190
all this stuff that required from

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,780
in fact of the other

00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:44,440
I think that

00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,440
you frighten me

00:37:51,579 --> 00:37:55,960
kill them

00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,960
own it

00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:09,210
doing that in trick now will definitely

00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:09,210
help us be on right hand for

00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:15,000
some lady was the same up my idea the

00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:19,730
same methodology

00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:23,470
help refactoring artists with

00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:26,190
to be more fun by the

00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:26,190
by doing that

00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:40,000
so we can actually do that tomorrow

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,000
for Charlotte

00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,830
yes

00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,290
I

00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:33,950
by moving different

00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,970
assume

00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:21,710
Oh

00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:45,940
like

00:42:57,619 --> 00:43:01,180
that gives us the biggest

00:43:34,099 --> 00:43:37,380
all

00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:40,380
where

00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,380
what

00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,740
whatever

00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:39,950
relevant and

00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,300
and

00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,530
about

00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:25,170
one we do both well

00:46:10,779 --> 00:46:15,620
I just thought of

00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,620
what'd you fight about

00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:21,880
by doing that

00:46:26,589 --> 00:46:29,910
required by the client

00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,250
though

00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:39,540
built that thing for the google annual

00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:39,540
it out but they know

00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:45,829
there was a small layer of of angular on

00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:51,839
it and then like they have had

00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:54,770
we've already done my to figure out how

00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,770
to be embedded

00:46:55,350 --> 00:47:03,140
well yeah I'm sort of thinking abut you

00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:03,140
would have to use modules right for the

00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:10,359
but what I was thinking of

00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:13,390
seven there

00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:20,230
what would it look like as far as trying

00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:20,230
to create functional

00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,650
but having

00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:29,330
on the final four right word you know

00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:29,330
some-some package

00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:37,930
how would that look like I mean is there

00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:43,230
triple integration that's required to

00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:43,230
die what if you like pure web components

00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,160
there's a JavaScript

00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:02,550
I want to put aside the idea that

00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:02,550
there's a toys

00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,140
or one

00:48:06,309 --> 00:48:08,969
I think

00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:14,330
already

00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:14,330
itself

00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:29,190
I that's easy for me to say I oh my how

00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:29,190
we actually the only bit about that

00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:35,900
in function right Cinderpelt didn't

00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:35,900
function

00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,920
so that's one way

00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,690
the module

00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,290
man

00:49:52,059 --> 00:49:54,390
some

00:50:55,089 --> 00:50:58,719
how much time we got left I've just been

00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:00,839
talking and talked and talked until I

00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:00,839
have

00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:21,519
fine

00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:29,890
