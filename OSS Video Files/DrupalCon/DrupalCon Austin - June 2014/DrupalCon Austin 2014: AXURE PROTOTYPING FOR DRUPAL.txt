Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: AXURE PROTOTYPING FOR DRUPAL
Publication date: 2014-06-03
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: danigrrl
When working on relatively simple sites, there's a lot you can do directly in Drupal to show clients how content and functionality will work together. But as functionality gets more complex and more stakeholders get involved in decisions about how the site will work, it's easy to lose development hours on code that will end up thrown out as the stakeholders rip apart your ideas.

Wireframes only tell part of the story. To really get buy-in from stakeholders, you need to show them more than what's on a page—you need to show them how something will WORK.

Enter Axure RP. A common tool used by UX practitioners, it allows you to create site maps, user flows and wireframes quickly, within a single application—and makes it easy to add interactive elements, annotate your work, and export working HTML prototypes with the click of a button. In this session, UX Designer and Drupal for Designers author Dani Nordin will share how she uses Axure to prototype complex functionality and get stakeholder buy-in on projects while saving her team development time.

What question(s) does this session answer?

How do I ensure my project is going in the right direction before spending time on development?
How do I manage projects with many stakeholders without losing my mind?
How can I turn my team's ideas into something we can test quickly?
In addition, you'll learn practical techniques for working with Axure to create prototypes that not only give you something testable—without spending days or weeks on Drupal code—but that can also be used to directly communicate important specifications to the development team.

is that better okay whatever so the

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,290
first part of the session is going to be

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,570
discussion and lecture I'm going to tell

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,860
you a little bit about why I do

00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,199
prototyping and actor as opposed to

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,320
going straight to Drupal give you some

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,810
sort of general trip tricks on how to

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,869
make your life easier working with actor

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,460
and how to work with developers and you

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:28,289
know answer questions and all that kind

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,640
of good stuff and then the second half

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,880
which is actually going to be after the

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,950
coffee break the second half is actually

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,690
going to be a live demo so I'm actually

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,059
going to show you how I walk through a

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,219
typical prototyping process and if you

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,410
want and you have your laptop's you can

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,170
feel free to download a trial of actor

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,510
and sort of play around with me so you

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:55,289
can see a little bit of the ropes if you

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:56,520
haven't played with it before so the

00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,460
first thing I should probably do is

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,829
introduce myself my name is Danny Danny

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,150
norden i am from the Boston area and

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,439
currently I've actually operated my own

00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,810
design consultancy called the zen

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,450
kitchen for almost a decade now but for

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,100
the last year and a half actually now

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,080
for the last almost year i've been

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,909
working at bentley university in the

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,180
user experience center while I get my

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,400
master's degree in human factors I'm the

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,650
UX lead of the Drupal community tools

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,210
team so I'm going to be focusing on the

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,890
ways that we collaborate and give

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,409
support to community members through

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,740
drupal org and giotto and all of our

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,420
different tools I also co-organized the

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,790
design for drupal camp in the Boston

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,110
area which is happening which is

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,970
actually happening the first weekend in

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,560
August and we are accepting session

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,340
proposals so if all of you all are

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:52,470
designers come and get one of my fancy

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:54,240
postcards after this session and propose

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,490
your session because we're looking for

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,860
great people to talk about design front

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,649
end development and also workflow and

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,079
process issues and to provide case

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,439
studies for the audience it's a great

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,020
event we get 300-plus people every year

00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:11,400
Cambridge is gorgeous in the summer you

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:16,090
guys should come down

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,129
so I also am a teacher I teach at

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,799
General Assembly in the Boston area UX

00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:22,720
design I wrote the book Drupal for

00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:24,159
designers for O'Reilly and on wednesday

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,690
i'll actually be signing copies of that

00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:30,069
book so if you want to come down and say

00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:31,720
hi you can and if i if i wasn't doing

00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:34,150
enough already i'm also the mother of

00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,530
this little adorable person right here

00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,440
who you'll see sometime tomorrow

00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:42,040
afternoon so you can find me on Twitter

00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:45,459
and do as Danny girl and I'd like to

00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,709
start with a tale of two projects a

00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:50,019
couple years ago I worked with Babson

00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:52,629
College a big business school in the

00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:54,010
Boston area on a critical piece of

00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:56,410
functionality for their learning

00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,720
management system this was their web

00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:01,180
syllabus and it was this big clunky

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,700
behemoth that was built in 2005 and

00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,950
hadn't been up to and had been sort of

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,480
cobbled together from bits of HTML and

00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:11,019
was basically being brought into

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,060
blackboard and they needed to redesign

00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:14,859
it and revamp it and make it easier to

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,590
use for the people who are in their

00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:19,989
online learning programs so the job

00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,720
started in a typical way I did user

00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:25,780
research did some journeys some personas

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,480
I brainstormed features with the

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,730
stakeholders and with other people I

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,669
refined that into functionality

00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:36,099
requirements but then after you know a

00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:37,930
few weeks the person that I was working

00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:41,290
with said well we need something we can

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:46,359
test we need something that you know we

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:48,190
can see so I was trying to figure out

00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:51,010
how to prototype this I played with

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:53,620
actor a little bit but it didn't seem

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,299
like something that I could you know get

00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,879
the developers to actually plug into

00:03:55,299 --> 00:04:00,160
dashboard it to to blackboard so we

00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:04,299
could put it into so we could actually

00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:07,930
put it into the LMS so I started working

00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:09,430
with drupal commons which was in version

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:14,349
6 at the time and started prototyping

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:16,989
and in order to make this syllabus work

00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:19,120
in drupal commons which was what they

00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:20,290
were using as their enhancements to

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,720
blackboard

00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:25,090
I needed three to five content types I

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,580
needed to work with node references

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:30,130
organic groups and views because that's

00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:32,140
how everything was organized and I had

00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:34,000
to touch not only the content layer but

00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:37,480
the theme layer and the menu layer in

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,540
the display layer and after 30-plus

00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:44,530
hours I had managed to get a third of

00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,600
the ideas that we had come up with as

00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:50,110
requirements of the system into this

00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,440
prototype and when the stakeholder saw

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,760
it they just didn't understand they're

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,950
like this doesn't look finished this

00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,720
doesn't look like why did you do all the

00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:03,940
user research you wasted all this time

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:06,160
yeah yeah so unfortunately now I was in

00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,080
a position where we're like okay we just

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,640
need to generate a specification and

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:16,020
then will you know call it a day so I

00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:18,310
decided to open a back sure and say okay

00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,320
let's try this out so I took the

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:25,210
tutorials while I was on a plane oddly

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:27,040
enough to Austin and in four hours I had

00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:29,560
managed to demonstrate everything that

00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,740
we were trying to do with annotated

00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,720
screen shots including the no dad screen

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,820
so that they could see the field and the

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,370
way that people should enter this into

00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:42,090
the system and generate a specification

00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:45,100
that was in a word document and had

00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:49,600
layouts wireframes and annotations

00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:52,390
listed with a click it was a three-step

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,640
process you click a button hit you know

00:05:52,390 --> 00:06:00,490
name the file hit enter and you have a

00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:04,720
specification so a year later I'm hired

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:09,070
by berklee college of music to bring to

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,800
legacy websites one in I want to say

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:15,640
SharePoint one in some kludgy version of

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:20,710
web advisor and the content for both of

00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:25,150
these websites into a Drupal site that

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:30,430
was already running and already had a

00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:32,780
year and a half of content in and most

00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:35,389
of this was coming in behind a log in

00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:37,940
we had to reorganize the content and the

00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:40,850
navigation 498 departments throughout

00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:45,200
the university we had to set up an

00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:47,360
entire internal system where students

00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,850
faculty and staff could log in and get

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,310
messages from the college including an

00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,720
internal dashboard and a subscription

00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,910
model where people could actually

00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,990
subscribe to the types and locations of

00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,960
announcements that they wanted to

00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,090
receive we had to re architect the way

00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,160
that departments and the way that

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:07,820
faculty and staff members were even

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,460
displayed in the system when I walked in

00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,500
a department was just a basic page with

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,110
Department information on it it wasn't

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,850
its own thing and in order to fit all of

00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,770
the department's information we actually

00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:22,220
had to create an entirely new content

00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:24,229
type and start associating different

00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,090
content with it and understand all of

00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:29,030
the different content that went with a

00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:31,490
department and we also had to re

00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:36,050
architect the college magazine which was

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:37,669
also brought in as basic pages and many

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:42,560
of which were automatically imported

00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:45,320
with no title that was fun so that piece

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:50,210
alone accounted for something like 1100

00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:51,979
links in one of the menus so by this

00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:55,610
time I'd had a bit more practice with

00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:57,710
actor and I started using actor heavily

00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,900
in my workflow because I could actually

00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,030
take on pieces of the experience and

00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,430
pieces of the research and start doing

00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,460
rapid prototyping while the developers

00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:09,410
are were working on other things and

00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,419
before we even had the content in there

00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:14,479
so i started with site maps and

00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:16,340
understanding where we were in terms of

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,740
the content and doing the site map

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:22,130
process and actor i was able to realize

00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:25,580
that we had content that lived in that

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:27,470
that was shown in this system and ninety

00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,860
percent of it was actually coming from

00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:35,539
this system and we had no idea where it

00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:37,550
lived in this system so we ended up

00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:40,130
having to create an entirely new

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:42,110
workflow to handle all of this an

00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:44,810
entirely new information architecture

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,649
and so we started doing some content

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,559
modeling

00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:50,240
so actually putting together what are

00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,069
the content types we need what are the

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,550
different fields that go in that content

00:08:52,069 --> 00:09:00,829
type how do they relate to each other I

00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:02,389
also prototyped complete departments so

00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:04,129
there were several departments that we

00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:06,350
knew we're going to have complex

00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:08,660
architecture our departments like human

00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,339
resources departments like the academic

00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,999
departments where we have syllabi and

00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:15,439
staff and we have downloads and I

00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:17,240
started seeing the different

00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:19,100
commonalities between those departments

00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,839
and prototyping what they would look

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,540
like when you're logged in versus when

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,819
you're not logged in and we also

00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,259
prototype to dashboard experience and

00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:30,559
what the subscription model would look

00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:34,550
like this entire process and mind you

00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:37,670
this is a college with 98 departments

00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:42,889
and two different locations took eight

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:46,160
months and in that time we did at least

00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:48,350
30 pages of site Maps prototypes for six

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,629
new features and functional content

00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:55,129
areas and a complete content overhaul of

00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:57,529
at least three different content areas

00:09:55,129 --> 00:10:02,389
and we were able to do that in one

00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:06,350
document that was shared online that

00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:09,350
could be sent via a URL to anyone within

00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:11,540
the college for feedback and the best

00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,160
part about it was I was annotating as I

00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,980
go so the developers actually worked

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:19,759
from it directly so we didn't even have

00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:22,399
to create a specification or any kind of

00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,929
documentation people that the project

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,569
manager just put the tasks into the

00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:28,730
system and pointed at the URL so this is

00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:36,170
the page in the prototype that you need

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:39,439
to go to so obviously I'm a proponent of

00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:43,009
actor but one of the questions I always

00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:46,699
get is can it give me production-ready

00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:51,679
code can I take action and plug it into

00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:54,559
Drupal unfortunately no it will not give

00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:56,809
you production-ready code additionally

00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,429
it can only mimic sort of database type

00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:59,209
interaction so if you're trying to like

00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:00,980
show people how

00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:04,550
search is going to work if you're trying

00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:06,290
to show people how content entry might

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:08,629
work you can really only mimic those

00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,819
kind of things it also has some issues

00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:13,369
when you're talking about certain

00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:15,970
interactions like drop-down menus are so

00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:21,309
much easier to create just coding them

00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:25,490
then they are to create an action but

00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:27,920
with this program you can actually go

00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:30,589
beyond wireframes and into actual

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,660
prototypes and not only can you do that

00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:34,009
you can put user flows in the document

00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,240
you can put content model in the

00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:37,249
document all of the typical

00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,189
documentation I've even put personas in

00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:44,029
actor and you can keep everything in one

00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:45,619
document that you can send to anyone in

00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:47,480
your organization and they can give

00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:50,809
feedback on it and they can discuss it

00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:53,240
right in the prototype which is

00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:55,449
available publicly online and you can

00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:59,809
password protect it if your clients are

00:11:55,449 --> 00:12:01,459
wishy about that the other thing that's

00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:04,399
really nice about actor and this is

00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:06,740
where I actually put it far ahead of

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,540
many of the other prototyping tools that

00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,799
you see out in the world there are a lot

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,410
of prototyping tools that are much

00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:14,389
better for creating a screen or a thing

00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,399
that you can interact with but they

00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:18,649
don't necessarily give you documentation

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,360
they don't necessarily give you the

00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:22,040
ability to show someone you're thinking

00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,290
show someone your raster now and put

00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,879
comments inside the document and that's

00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,549
the thing that actor really really

00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:30,949
excels at and not only can you annotate

00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:32,600
as you go which saves a ton of time and

00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:34,459
helps the developers see exactly where

00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,980
you're coming from when you output a

00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:39,860
specification all of those comments are

00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,860
right there with your document they're

00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,299
right there with your wire frames

00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,790
another thing that it allows you to do

00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:48,139
and if anyone here has been to a design

00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:51,410
for drupal and heard me talk about

00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:54,019
fireworks versus photoshop i lean

00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:57,290
heavily on the fireworks side because it

00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:59,629
gives you multiple pages and you can

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,939
share layers among those pages so you

00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:03,740
don't have to repeat your work and

00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:06,350
anyone who's ever had to prototype a

00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:08,240
complex navigation understand how

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:11,139
important it is to not have to repeat it

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,139
in multiple files

00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,470
axure gives you that same ability you

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,910
can create a master and share that

00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,920
master in all of the pages of your

00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,170
document or select pages of your

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,240
document so that if we're working on a

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,310
complex navigation and I have to make it

00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:29,000
erations to it I make that iteration

00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:30,890
once and the minute I save it goes to

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,280
all of the pages that you use that

00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:36,260
master the other thing that's really

00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:39,440
nice and this is actually a feature that

00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:41,870
just came out in actor 7 I believe is

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,670
you can actually create team projects

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,400
and what that means is you can actually

00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:50,060
create a project that another person can

00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,620
go into and work on with you so you can

00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,960
be prototyping this slice of the

00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,880
experience and your collaborator can be

00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,480
prototyping this slice of the experience

00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:01,850
in the same document and you check

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:06,110
things in and out much like you would

00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:08,270
with git or svn so it really is

00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,950
wonderful for working in distributed

00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,330
teams it's one of the best tools that

00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,890
I've found for working and distributed

00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:17,510
teams i found i work on a lot of

00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:19,760
distributed teams so in terms of when

00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:23,900
you need to work in action one of the

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,430
things that is really important to frame

00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,400
this conversation is I'm not suggesting

00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:30,800
that we don't work in Drupal I'm not

00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,870
suggesting that we you know sit on our

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,780
hands and do everything in action before

00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:38,000
we ever touch Drupal there's still a lot

00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:40,370
of stuff that needs to be done in Drupal

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,140
while prototyping is happening in action

00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:43,970
so for example it's not going to change

00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,470
the way that you configure the database

00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,750
it's not going to change the way that

00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:50,210
you have to update the text formats

00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,070
figure out the basic modules start

00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:54,350
working on some of the views you can

00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:57,710
still do all of that work but the times

00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,120
you need to work in actor are when the

00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,290
feedback that you're getting and the

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,490
changes you're going to make are going

00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:05,600
to be coming from a lot of different

00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:08,420
areas and when things are likely to

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,120
change frequently so for example I

00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:13,640
showed you the navigation on Berkeley

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,870
that one tab that had something like 20

00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:21,650
different items in it there were 10 to

00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:23,340
12 of them all like that on this one

00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,080
site by the time we were done

00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,600
every time we got out of a meeting with

00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,400
Department the Department wanted one or

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,130
two more links in there and we had to

00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:35,820
move stuff around and rename things okay

00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:37,950
we've got that's why i I'm I'm math and

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,530
paired today so I don't know exactly how

00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:43,530
many links that is but i can tell you

00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:46,680
trying to do that in drupal in the menu

00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:49,560
system when half of the content isn't

00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,480
even in drupal yet that's a lot of

00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:55,860
development time just on messing around

00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:58,800
with menus meanwhile in actor because i

00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,750
had this set up 15 minutes after the

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,000
meeting and the iteration was done and

00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:07,520
it was pushed out and people could look

00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,840
at it again huge huge time savings

00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,060
another thing that's really nice is when

00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,260
you're working with a smaller

00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:15,300
foundational slice of the experience

00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,130
that's not ready to be built yet and you

00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,290
need to get that experience right before

00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:21,090
you start committing things to co so

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,590
this is really important for example

00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:24,990
when we were figuring out that

00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:26,850
departments needed to have their own

00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,800
content type and they needed different

00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,900
content to be associated with them and

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,580
we needed to work out what was the

00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,680
content that needed to be associated

00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:39,090
with them how did it need to go into the

00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:42,360
system and during the process of that we

00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:44,490
learned that for example syllabi could

00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,440
change every semester and they were 20

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,030
30 files if you're trying to put that

00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,350
manually in there there's five different

00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:53,820
ways that you can do that in Drupal and

00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,050
you need to figure out which one is

00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,910
going to work the best you don't

00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,770
necessarily need to work in Drupal for

00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,750
that you can actually go and you can

00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:03,930
start prototyping bits of the experience

00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:06,090
in actor and you can start running that

00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,650
by the different departments and saying

00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:09,090
this is what your department could look

00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,380
like this is the architecture we're

00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:14,070
thinking about for your specific

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,480
department poke holes in this what is

00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:17,330
this you know what does this look like

00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,670
how is this going to work for you and

00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:23,850
get all of that stuff settled before you

00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:26,930
spend development hours in Drupal that

00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:29,820
is when actor really really shines is

00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:32,760
when the thing that you're building is

00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:35,059
so complex or could change so frequently

00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:38,960
or is really just such a pain

00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:41,480
to change quickly that it makes sense to

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:46,519
do it here and then put it into action

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:47,690
when you got the approval so let's talk

00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:51,470
about some of the things that you can

00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:53,090
actually make an actor one of the most

00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,950
obvious and one of the things that I

00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:57,370
think sometimes people don't realize

00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:59,929
when they work in actor is site maps and

00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,999
you can make them by default you can

00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:05,149
actually create them as flow diagrams

00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:07,190
you can also have connectors really

00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:09,649
really easily you can post them online

00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:13,820
you can even drag pages from your site

00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:15,860
map into a document so that when you

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:20,360
click on it it clip it goes directly to

00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:23,830
that page content models and these are

00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:27,470
something I use specifically to describe

00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:31,909
when we're doing sort of a more complex

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:34,909
content type than just you know a body

00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:36,440
and a few different fields and we've got

00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:38,179
different things that relate to each

00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,700
other and we want to show all of the

00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:42,889
different relationships that's something

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,629
that I really use content models for and

00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:48,590
you can document everything as you go

00:18:44,629 --> 00:18:50,539
then obviously you can do prototypes but

00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:52,909
you can also do documentation and

00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:54,379
discussion so it's not just the fact

00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:56,480
that you've got a prototype that you can

00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:59,629
now put in front of a user and test it's

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,429
that you've actually documented all of

00:18:59,629 --> 00:19:03,409
the thinking behind this all of the

00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:05,210
stuff that has to go in all of the

00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:10,879
things that you might use to implement

00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:13,580
it in the same document it's not

00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:16,249
floating around 80 different word

00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:18,950
documents in the client folder it's

00:19:16,249 --> 00:19:20,539
actually in one document and anyone on

00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,220
the team can go and look at that

00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:25,059
document and figure out where they need

00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:27,950
to go to get the information they need

00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:32,450
so this is the number one reason why i

00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:33,769
use actor as opposed to other tools so

00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:37,730
given that i want to give you some tips

00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:40,519
and then i want to show you a little bit

00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:42,619
of the prototypes that i've worked on

00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:44,629
and give you some stories of how i use

00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:47,750
them and then i'm going to answer some

00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:48,909
questions so the biggest tip i can give

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,769
you is to really start

00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:54,399
with the actual core training that actor

00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:56,979
provides on its website I've known many

00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:59,789
people if you're a designer already it's

00:19:56,979 --> 00:20:02,379
pretty easy to learn the basics of actor

00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:04,389
but there's some of the more complex

00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:06,789
bits that do require a little bit of

00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:08,979
training and the tutorials are literally

00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:10,869
an hour of your life and you learn

00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:14,259
everything you need to know to get the

00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:16,090
basics done the other thing and this is

00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:18,340
a really important one for my workflow

00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,979
is to actually start with some widget

00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:23,109
libraries an actor has a whole bunch of

00:20:20,979 --> 00:20:24,909
widget libraries available for free on

00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:26,889
its site there's a couple of more

00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:30,039
advanced ones that are available for pay

00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:32,889
and one of the things that the libraries

00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:35,470
do is it gives you a nice base of

00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:37,479
defaults so that you can make really

00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:41,440
good looking wireframes much more

00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:44,169
rapidly than you would with the defaults

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,590
that actor gives you my favorites

00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:49,749
include the faun awesome library there's

00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,729
a call out library called EE call out

00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:54,249
and then there's another one called web

00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:56,950
widgets by proto five that i use for

00:20:54,249 --> 00:21:01,629
almost everything at this point i was

00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:04,989
hoping that I could get sort of a Drupal

00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:10,029
a Drupal actor widget library ready by

00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:13,659
Khan but I'm a bit busy so I couldn't do

00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:15,759
that I apologize the other thing is to

00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:17,619
set up an account on actor share now

00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,720
aksha share is actually a free service

00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:22,210
to anyone who owns actor and basically

00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,830
what it allows you to do is with the

00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,769
click of a button you can actually push

00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:29,499
your prototype onto the web and share it

00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:30,820
with members of your team and not only

00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:32,799
can you share it with members of the

00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,320
team you can actually discuss it

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,549
directly in the document and i'm going

00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,830
to show you that in a couple of minutes

00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:40,330
we're going to see how that works and

00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,759
it's free for up to a thousand

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:44,830
prototypes so if you're working in a

00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:46,779
distributed in a distributed team and

00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:49,450
you need to collaborate with multiple

00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:51,099
people this is how you do it you

00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,769
generate a prototype and say I need

00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:56,470
feedback on this use the Disqus tab and

00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:59,039
then you start having discussions this

00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:01,779
is actually one of the things as my as

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,680
i'm doing designs for the community

00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,660
tools team

00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,650
do that's one of the things that we're

00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,090
going to be doing we're going to be

00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,910
working with actual prototypes and

00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,170
asking the community to give us feedback

00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:14,740
directly in the prototype so that

00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:16,420
everything stays in one location and the

00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:19,180
other thing that you really want to do

00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:23,050
is annotate and I cannot emphasize this

00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:24,940
enough the reason I was available I was

00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,860
able to create such an efficient

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,500
workflow with the team that I work with

00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:32,320
at Berkeley was because as I went I

00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,030
annotated everything I was doing and I

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,280
said this is where this would come from

00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:39,640
this is what this links to try this

00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:41,890
module this comes from this and you can

00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,900
even use page notes to discuss specific

00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,310
aspects of the experience or specific

00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:52,720
types of feedback that you're actually

00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:56,410
looking for another thing is to work

00:22:52,720 --> 00:23:01,800
with masters and masters are similar to

00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:04,510
layers in Photoshop or fireworks and

00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,980
essentially they let you reuse specific

00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,320
components throughout the pages of your

00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,210
site which makes it much more efficient

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,270
to iterate on things this is especially

00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:17,140
true with navigation but it's also true

00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:19,840
with just basic elements a team project

00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,580
are a relatively new feature of actor

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,710
and this is again really good if you're

00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:26,380
working with a distributed team imagine

00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:28,840
that you've got your prototype shared on

00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,250
a Dropbox and you've got that Dropbox

00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,980
shared with your teammate and your

00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:35,020
teammates in another state and you guys

00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,520
have a big presentation and you need to

00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,200
work on this section of the

00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,180
functionality they need to work on this

00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,220
other section of the functionality you

00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:46,180
can both be working on the same document

00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:48,040
together sharing components and reusing

00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:52,150
them from place to place and creating a

00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:54,370
completely consistent layout regardless

00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:57,040
of where you're located and regardless

00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:59,950
of when you're working on it that's what

00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:03,070
that's what this team project allows you

00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:04,990
to do another thing that you want to use

00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:08,740
that you want to do is use font awesome

00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:10,240
for icons I actually before fond awesome

00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,130
came out I downloaded a bunch of

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,840
different icon libraries and the problem

00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:16,580
that I had with them was they were

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,169
always images and they were always

00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,330
color I couldn't change any of the

00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:24,440
colors on them which meant that if I was

00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:26,149
actually trying to create contrast for

00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,100
example by having a black background

00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:29,809
with white icons I couldn't do that

00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:33,080
because I couldn't find a white icon

00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:34,760
library so when I started using font

00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,820
awesome which requires a little bit of

00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:40,070
setup but it's really not hard now I

00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,990
could easily make the icon whatever

00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:43,820
color I want it which means you can

00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,190
actually go from you know low to

00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:50,659
relatively high fidelity very easily

00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:53,059
with your wire frames another thing you

00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:56,630
want to look at is adaptive views and

00:24:53,059 --> 00:25:01,159
grid now adaptive views actually allow

00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:03,289
you to set up break points to mimic

00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:06,769
responsive design it's not perfect but

00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:08,840
it's very very close and it works really

00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:10,669
well and it has some of the standard

00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,799
presets already for you so you basically

00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:16,070
just set up your adaptive grids and then

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:18,470
go and you can do all of your work in

00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:22,700
the base view and then you just click on

00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:25,159
one of the other views and move stuff

00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,450
around and it's really easy and that's

00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:29,210
going to be part of the demo I'm going

00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:32,000
to do after the break same thing with

00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:36,230
grids grids also have four different

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,830
presets including a 12 and 15 column

00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:42,559
1200 grid and a 12 and 16 column 960

00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,090
grid and all of this is built into the

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,130
tool so you don't really need to

00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,600
download anything or figure stuff out

00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:50,659
you just need to know where to find it

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,179
and then the last thing is to work with

00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:56,350
widget and page Styles and what those

00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:59,809
allow you to do is really customize

00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:02,330
really easily customize the way that

00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:04,399
your prototype looks and it helps you go

00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:06,590
from really low fidelity to really high

00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:09,080
fidelity much easier you can actually

00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:11,809
add sketch effects to your prototype

00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:16,490
with page styles and you can make it

00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:17,840
gray scale even if its color so it's

00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:19,580
really nice if you have certain

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,230
stakeholders who are really going to get

00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,149
distracted by the shade of blue you're

00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:25,039
using and you just want to make a

00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:26,750
grayscale for them so they can shut up

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,640
and like talk about what really matters

00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:31,220
very useful for that

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,890
it's also by the way really useful for

00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:37,940
people who are really really stuck on

00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:40,750
balsamic I've had multiple conversations

00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:46,370
with this and actually my best friend

00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:48,170
works at bio raft and she was having a

00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:51,200
conversation with me she's doing a

00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:53,330
session on the Hat later about the

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:58,550
reason that they you know standardized

00:26:53,330 --> 00:27:00,950
on balsamic and and my friend Heather is

00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,720
trying to tell her oh well you know um

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:04,010
you know actor just lets you do a lot

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,840
more and she's like oh well you know

00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:08,510
well you know that's okay well what does

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,790
Danny think about it and and Heather

00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:12,290
said well Danny thinks that act that

00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:15,230
that balsamic is kind of what happens

00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:20,080
when you give a developer crayons and

00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:23,540
let them go which is not totally true

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,400
balsamic has its uses but the reason

00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:28,010
that I standardized and committed myself

00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,500
to working in actor and I still work in

00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:32,960
Drupal occasionally but the reason I'm

00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:35,960
standardize on actor is because to me a

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,360
prototype is not just about looking at

00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,980
something it's about looking at

00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,860
something and being able to document

00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:44,840
your thinking and get developers and

00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:46,370
stakeholders on board and create

00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,340
something that you can test with real

00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:52,370
users without having to reinvent the

00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:54,980
wheel every time that's why I

00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:57,140
standardize on axure it's because I can

00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:59,630
do all of this at a much faster pace

00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:02,240
than I could if I'm creating wireframes

00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:05,540
in balsamic and then going into this

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,570
thing and doing all of these annotations

00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:11,330
and then going over here and doing all

00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:13,100
of these annotations I can do everything

00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:15,290
in one document and the developers can

00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:20,030
just look at it and say okay this is

00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:21,590
what I have to do so you might be

00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:24,560
thinking now what up but what about

00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:28,220
Drupal don't you want to prototype in

00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:29,570
the browser first I would argue that

00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,270
prototyping and Drupal is not

00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:34,550
prototyping in the browser it's

00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:36,590
prototyping in Drupal and prototyping

00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:38,480
and Drupal requires that you have the

00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:42,370
content first and how many of us rate

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:47,270
show of hands has the content first

00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:52,400
yeah so this is why you don't start off

00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:54,530
in Drupal it's really time and labor

00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:58,330
intensive for anything that's more

00:28:54,530 --> 00:29:01,550
complex than a simple content type on

00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:04,360
top of that one of the biggest problems

00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:06,620
is you can't necessarily give up on code

00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,880
once you've spent the time do you really

00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,130
want to just give up on that and just

00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,720
throw that away I've heard people tell

00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:16,580
me that they'll throw away code but I've

00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:18,740
rarely seen it done and so when you go

00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:21,050
through a usability test and you're

00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:23,330
using a site that you spent hours and

00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:25,490
hours and hours developing and Drupal

00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:27,020
and you find that the thing that you

00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:29,360
built that you spent so much time and

00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:33,530
effort on has critical usability flaws

00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,630
that are going to break this site what

00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:37,700
are you going to do are you going to go

00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,200
back and fix those flaws or are you

00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,820
going to put them in a backlog somewhere

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:48,610
and say yeah we'll get to that

00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:53,420
eventually the important thing about

00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:55,730
working in Drupal is you work in Drupal

00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,500
alongside prototyping some of the more

00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:59,720
complex stuff that requires more

00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:02,840
feedback and requires more iteration in

00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:05,210
action this is where during your project

00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:08,120
management cycle you want to think about

00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:10,790
the process of breaking things into

00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:13,010
functional segments into chunks of

00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:15,830
functionality slices of the experience

00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:17,420
that you can work on independently so

00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:20,240
that everyone on the team is doing

00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:22,280
something as opposed to you know I'm

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,010
going to build all of the content types

00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:29,570
this week has anyone ever gotten a

00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:32,230
project plan like that I have did you

00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,230
laugh at them too

00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:38,690
because you know what it's like working

00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:40,010
in Drupal you know you realize somewhere

00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:42,080
down the line when you actually have

00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:44,270
content that actually know this content

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,560
has like five more fields then we

00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:47,210
thought it was going to have so now we

00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,430
have to go back to the content type and

00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:51,140
make edits to that oh and now wait a

00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,700
minute we only hit managed fields we

00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,530
didn't hit manage display so now we got

00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,600
to go back to the content type and now

00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:59,240
move all the fields around and oh this

00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,730
looks really crappy in line so we're

00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,470
just going to make it above and like it

00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:05,450
just goes over and over and over again

00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:07,180
we've actually you can play around with

00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:10,070
all that stuff without the headaches and

00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:11,480
you can get it right before you have to

00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,340
sit there and muck around with Drupal

00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:17,900
but it doesn't replace the fact that

00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:19,340
you're doing some stuff and Drupal one

00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:23,980
of the things that I like doing in

00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:28,580
Drupal that I like using Drupal for is

00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:30,350
anything that requires me to play around

00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,960
with content models and entity

00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:36,560
references and see the relationships a

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:39,470
bit more easily also anything that

00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:42,680
actively will require interacting with

00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:45,860
the database so for example if I need to

00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,390
find a way to bulk upload files into the

00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:49,040
system am I going to do that an actor

00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:52,150
probably not because that's a technical

00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:54,140
solution so technical solutions are

00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:56,410
absolutely something that you want to

00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:59,930
explore and play around with in Drupal

00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:02,120
and you also do want to understand how

00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:04,010
Drupal's infrastructure will impact the

00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:07,310
UX of what you're building so this is

00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:09,620
one of the benefits that I see as a UX

00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:11,600
designer who not only works in action

00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,670
but also can speak the language of

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,550
Drupal and can work in Drupal I know

00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:18,290
when I have to do something in Drupal as

00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:21,620
opposed to doing everything in actor and

00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:23,390
I can switch between the two and that's

00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:25,160
the point it's knowing when to switch

00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:27,470
between the two and knowing what needs

00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,050
not what needs strict documentation and

00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:32,290
what's really just an item on a to-do

00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,290
list

00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:41,720
so I want to talk a little bit about the

00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:43,190
prototyping process just a very high

00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,690
level overview and then i'm going to

00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,980
show you guys a little bit of prototypes

00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:49,669
and then we're going to have about 15

00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:52,429
minutes for you know Q&A so the first

00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:54,890
step of prototyping and actor is to

00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:57,159
identify which piece of the pitch pieces

00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:59,929
of the puzzle actually need prototyping

00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:01,850
I will say if you're working on any kind

00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:03,980
of complex navigation with a lot of

00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,620
different items that is something that

00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:07,700
you should probably put in a prototype

00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:09,980
instead of trying to do it in the menu

00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,960
system in Drupal and there's a few

00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:14,179
different reasons why one it's just a

00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,320
time-suck to try to do that in Drupal

00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:17,929
especially if you have a bunch of

00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,909
different items and second as we all

00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:21,620
know Drupal's menu structure basically

00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:24,559
requires that the content is in the

00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,510
database before it can go in a menu who

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:32,179
has the content before they start

00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:37,940
building yeah so at the Berkeley in the

00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:42,880
Berkeley project for example we launched

00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:42,880
in August I started into in December

00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:54,080
june seventh was the last time the

00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:56,179
navigation changed jun 7th was the last

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,360
time someone said oh and then like two

00:33:56,179 --> 00:34:01,580
weeks before launch one of the the

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:05,330
communications director went in and

00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:07,640
moved two items in the main menu because

00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:09,859
now they were in drupal so so anything

00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:12,169
like that very important to prototype

00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:13,960
before you go any time you're building

00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:16,940
an entirely new section of content

00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,679
that's going to require new content

00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,810
types new fields any of that kind of

00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:22,580
stuff that's really nice to prototype in

00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:25,550
Drupal because you can actually work out

00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:27,320
for example you know I've got this

00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:29,270
content that's in a word document how

00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:32,389
does this break out into actual pages on

00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:34,220
a website what types of content am I

00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:39,109
actually dealing with here and how do

00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:41,119
they go together we also wanted to

00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:43,399
determine the actual goals what we're

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,879
going to do with the prototype all right

00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:48,679
so is the prototype primarily for

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:51,559
you know showing a concept is it for

00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:53,960
testing with users if it's for if it's

00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:55,909
for user testing and prototypes are very

00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,440
good for user testing by the way but if

00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:59,599
it's for user testing you need to have

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,880
an idea of what task flow someone's

00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,289
going to have to go through so that you

00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,410
know what screens you're going to have

00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:08,119
to prototype you also want to know are

00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:10,460
we dealing with information architecture

00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:12,710
here as well like are we supposed to be

00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,180
modeling content in here is this so the

00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:16,549
developers can understand what they need

00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:18,049
to build is this so we can you know talk

00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:20,930
to stakeholders and get their feedback

00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:23,359
on it all of this stuff helps you figure

00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:27,829
out what is it that I'm going to do with

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:30,470
in this document and the beauty of actor

00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:33,619
is you can actually export the stuff

00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:35,869
that you do in so many different ways so

00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:38,480
you can actually have two different

00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:40,910
links one is the prototype you use for

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,160
testing which has no annotations on it

00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:44,900
at all and one is the one that you use

00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,279
for documentation and then it has all of

00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:49,130
your annotations and you don't need to

00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:51,589
change your workflow you just need to

00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:55,759
change some buttons on this on the thing

00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:58,220
that you output so once you've done that

00:35:55,759 --> 00:35:59,900
you want to figure out what pages and

00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:02,809
what features you need to put in there

00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:05,839
and then you're going to set up your

00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:07,400
base layers so your base layers is just

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,140
the base of your functionality that's

00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,930
going to help you set up that sort of

00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:14,390
design environment with an actor so this

00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:16,670
is where we talk about adaptive use page

00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:19,099
grids making sure you got the right

00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:21,829
widget libraries making sure you've got

00:36:19,099 --> 00:36:25,039
fun awesome installed and then you set

00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:27,170
up your header and footer so now we're

00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:28,700
getting into a pretty common design

00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:31,039
process for anyone who's done this

00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,900
before right is anyone else a designer

00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:34,549
and usually starts with the header and

00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,559
footer and then starts doing the middle

00:36:34,549 --> 00:36:38,839
and the sidebars yeah so it's exactly

00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:40,519
the same process and so if you're a

00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:44,299
designer you're going to find this very

00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:46,339
familiar and then the biggest thing is

00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:47,630
to use masters for the elements that

00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:50,109
you're going to use over and over again

00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:55,130
especially if they're likely to change

00:36:50,109 --> 00:36:57,619
over time and you also can use styles so

00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,849
for example if you have common elements

00:36:57,619 --> 00:36:59,660
that you're going to use all the time

00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:01,160
and you want them to

00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,920
look the same you can actually create a

00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:07,339
style for those elements and then reuse

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,410
them throughout your document and it

00:37:07,339 --> 00:37:11,869
saves you a lot of time because let's

00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:13,520
say that you need to start at low

00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:16,190
fidelity but then now I need to start

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,690
getting into actual layout well most of

00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:20,059
us are going to open up Photoshop right

00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:24,140
we don't need to do that we can do it in

00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:26,480
action and all we have to do is change

00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:29,390
your files is change our styles change

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,430
our fonts change like all of that stuff

00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,839
you can actually do in action and it

00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:34,640
becomes a much more efficient workflow

00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:37,339
because you can actually see it online

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:40,250
and it actually looks like the thing

00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:41,660
it's supposed to look like sorta it's

00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:43,130
not complete but it actually looks

00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,410
mostly like what it's going to look like

00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:47,930
so it actually helps you create a much

00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:51,230
more realistic workflow and realistic

00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:54,140
experience for stakeholders so you don't

00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:56,030
get those stupid phone calls and emails

00:37:54,140 --> 00:38:00,740
about well why is this one pixel off to

00:37:56,030 --> 00:38:04,609
the left although you still might who

00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:06,619
knows so then you know once you've got

00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:08,539
that basic layout together that's when

00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:11,150
you start putting in the other pages so

00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:13,430
it's really a flow like any other once

00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:17,059
you get your base set up like anything

00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:18,349
else you just keep going and then the

00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:21,049
biggest thing that you're doing here is

00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:22,579
you're actually annotating as you go so

00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:24,260
if you're working in photoshop or

00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:26,599
fireworks you might be like you know

00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,980
jazz you know going along you're like

00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:29,270
yeah I'm going to put this here I'm

00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:31,940
going to put this here and you got a

00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:33,460
rationale in your mind but then someone

00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:38,390
asks you to explain your decision

00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:41,510
they're like oh I totally remember why I

00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:43,640
did that totally and you sort of make

00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:45,230
something up but what if you're not even

00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,750
in the room when you present how often

00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:49,880
is that the case if you annotate as you

00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:52,670
go you actually can put your rationale

00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,500
right in the document and it displays

00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,329
right there and you can show it to a

00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,339
stakeholder and say see this is what I

00:38:56,329 --> 00:38:59,539
was thinking and the whole workflow is

00:38:58,339 --> 00:39:01,819
much more efficient because you

00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:03,170
basically create an element annotate it

00:39:01,819 --> 00:39:06,920
and then go on and create the next

00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:09,650
element and then you get to publish to

00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:12,410
actor share and this as soon as you set

00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:13,070
up an account it's super easy you set up

00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:16,940
an account

00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:19,580
it publishes you set up the the settings

00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:22,040
for your career prototype and it goes

00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:24,440
right there the only thing you do want

00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:27,200
to make sure of is that if you're using

00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:31,220
fun awesome that the actual font awesome

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:34,220
CSS is included in your document and the

00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:37,550
tutorial on if you like if you google

00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:39,830
actor font awesome widget library you

00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:41,840
find it and it's like super easy and you

00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:43,370
can just create a custom generator to

00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,640
actually include font awesome in there

00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:53,560
and then you discuss an iterator so

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:56,360
again totally normal design process so i

00:39:53,560 --> 00:40:04,400
want to show you just a couple of the

00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:07,610
prototypes that i've made with actor so

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:11,770
this is part of the prototype that I did

00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:14,690
for Berkeley and what you can see here

00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:18,020
this is the sidebar and the sidebar has

00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:19,910
your site map and the site map shows all

00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:23,090
of the pages that are within the site

00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:25,700
this might be a little tiny so don't pay

00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:28,610
too much attention to that here we've

00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:31,580
got page notes and I didn't put Paige

00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:33,770
notes in here in this document but this

00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:35,950
will actually tell you for example this

00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:39,830
is the specific you could put in here

00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:41,300
this is the goal of this page that's one

00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:43,970
of the things i do now this is the goal

00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:46,040
the goals of this page and this is the

00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:47,330
specific feedback we're looking for and

00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:50,870
here's the deadline for that feedback

00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:54,080
and so if you look if you start with the

00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:55,790
page note you can actually see ok as a

00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:59,540
stakeholder I need to be looking at

00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:02,980
these things what do I look at and then

00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,980
here I can actually discuss

00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:20,490
so I can actually create a comment that

00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:23,880
goes right into the document and so what

00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:27,300
I've done since leaving berkeley and

00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,920
going to the user experience center when

00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,630
I do these prototypes and I'm in

00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,790
meetings and we're showing the prototype

00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:35,040
I'm actually in the document in this

00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:38,250
discussion tab creating new topics as

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,260
we're going so that I can actually take

00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:41,850
note of the things that I'm hearing from

00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,680
stakeholders the things that I'm going

00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:47,820
to have to iterate on and they're right

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:50,130
in this in the document with me and so

00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:52,080
now when I go back and I have to iterate

00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:54,390
on this document I can look and say okay

00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:57,920
I have to deal with that all right all

00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:57,920
right now this has been taken care of

00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:12,249
so i can add a comment saying that this

00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:14,499
was resolved all right so you know when

00:42:12,249 --> 00:42:16,960
i am actually when we're at the point in

00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:18,729
the community tools team when we're

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,890
prototyping different areas of

00:42:18,729 --> 00:42:22,690
functionality i can actually post a

00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:27,670
prototype out to the community and say

00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:29,469
we need feedback by this date please add

00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:32,499
your name to any feedback because

00:42:29,469 --> 00:42:38,319
anonymous comments will be ignored which

00:42:32,499 --> 00:42:41,680
by the way that's true early morning but

00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:44,529
you can see how how interesting this is

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,809
right because you can see what I'm you

00:42:44,529 --> 00:42:50,789
can see what I've created here you can

00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:50,789
actually see a comment here that

00:42:51,660 --> 00:43:00,369
actually explained the rationale so you

00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:02,979
can actually see the work in progress

00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:05,710
and understand it in the context of the

00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:07,269
actual design as opposed to a bunch of

00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:12,099
words that you're reading through and

00:43:07,269 --> 00:43:13,900
then you see the design and then you can

00:43:12,099 --> 00:43:16,739
discuss it right here and you don't even

00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,739
have to be in the room

00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:25,520
and then in terms of interactions you

00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:30,980
can actually do drop downs reasonably

00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:37,309
well so this was the menu if you weren't

00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:40,309
logged in and it grew quite a bit by the

00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:41,960
time we were done and if you were logged

00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:43,369
in there were like four other tabs and

00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,720
so every time we left a meeting I had to

00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:46,819
go in and change this menu again and

00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,190
because it was a master i went and it

00:43:46,819 --> 00:43:57,859
was 15 minutes and it went on all of the

00:43:49,190 --> 00:44:01,910
different pages I don't remember if I

00:43:57,859 --> 00:44:05,140
did this okay another one that I

00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:07,609
recently did and this is one that i will

00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:12,289
show you this is the one that i'm going

00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:21,079
to be sort of showing in the demo so

00:44:12,289 --> 00:44:25,400
this is drupal.org and this is a mock-up

00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:27,559
of a user profile so you can see where

00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:33,589
the berkeley where berkeley is

00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:40,190
relatively low fidelity right but you

00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:42,230
can actually type in here hit login and

00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:46,849
that should send you to the dashboard

00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:48,619
but it looks like it didn't go well but

00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:50,390
you can go from like being mostly black

00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:57,200
and white to actually be pretty high

00:44:50,390 --> 00:45:01,730
fidelity and here again I'm annotating

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:03,289
as I go so that everyone sees what we're

00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:06,559
thinking about here and what were in

00:45:03,289 --> 00:45:12,369
what we're suggesting and you can

00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:12,369
actually discuss it all along the side

00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:18,589
and then the other thing that's nice

00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:21,920
about this so I can hide this so you can

00:45:18,589 --> 00:45:26,470
see more of it and then I actually was

00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,470
able to make this somewhat responsive

00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:34,439
not entirely but close

00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:42,750
so it's not quite as easy as you know

00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:46,140
putting something together in HTML I'll

00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:48,480
admit but it gives you enough of the

00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:51,200
functionality and most importantly it

00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,200
provides documentation

00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:05,750
so after the break I'm going to actually

00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:08,300
do a live demo so that you can see how

00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:10,070
you can put together an actor file but

00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:14,960
in the meantime I'd love to take any

00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:16,400
questions that you have yeah please oh

00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,650
yes and please use the microphone

00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,350
because we're being recorded yeah so

00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:23,690
this is good i've had this debate

00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:26,720
internally for a long time about whether

00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:31,310
i'm doing prototyping in Drupal or not

00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:34,070
if there was a way to have those sort of

00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:37,510
inline notes that you kept referencing

00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:41,450
an actor in a drupal site with that

00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:45,740
bridge some of the gap for you for me

00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:47,660
now and the reason why is if you

00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:51,650
remember the story that I told you about

00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:53,360
Babson it took 30 plus hours to

00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:55,280
prototype the same thing in the Drupal

00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:58,940
in Drupal that I could prototype in four

00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:01,280
hours an actor I know that like with

00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:03,050
content you don't you don't usually have

00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,940
the content from the client but a lot of

00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:06,500
times you you have a sense like okay I

00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:08,000
know they're going to have this news i

00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,520
don't know they're gonna have events can

00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,260
I just start populating that even then

00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,940
just tell the client hate this isn't

00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:17,000
going to look good but let's just see

00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:18,740
how it well and use and things like news

00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,930
and events you don't necessarily have to

00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:22,820
prototype in action sure but anything

00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:23,930
that's remotely complex especially

00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:26,840
anything that's going to change

00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:29,600
frequently that's going to take you a

00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,730
long time in Drupal it justice and it's

00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:33,500
and prototyping actor is not taking away

00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:36,200
any of the work that you're doing

00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:37,940
interval it's just saying you know what

00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,240
we're going to use this other tool for

00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:44,450
actually I da ting and iterating on this

00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:47,270
because we're going to save dozens of

00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:49,910
hours of development time by getting

00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:53,300
this right before we start doing drupal

00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:56,270
and the time savings you get from

00:47:53,300 --> 00:48:01,780
working here is worlds better I mean

00:47:56,270 --> 00:48:01,780
just like unbelievable okay

00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:11,540
yeah so how does a licensing work um the

00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:14,030
licensing is fairly I mean it's a it is

00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:16,250
a product that you have to pay for I

00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:19,880
recommend the pro license which is six

00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:22,130
hundred dollars people have told me that

00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:24,079
that seems expensive but I also tell

00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:25,640
them that it paid for itself roughly two

00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:30,470
hundred times over the first product I

00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:33,109
used it for so it's been the most

00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:35,180
worthwhile purchase the second most

00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:37,640
worthwhile purchase I've made since i

00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:40,849
started doing ux so who has to have a

00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:43,310
license um I mean whatever computer is

00:48:40,849 --> 00:48:45,890
on but I've actually used my license on

00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:47,780
multiple computers ok so the web form

00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:51,800
you're displaying so if you're sharing

00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:54,530
that with other people like how oh this

00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:57,910
isn't really owned by anyone ok yeah

00:48:54,530 --> 00:49:00,589
this is just this is just a way of

00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:03,170
displaying the work and discussing it ok

00:49:00,589 --> 00:49:05,180
and what you and what you create is just

00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:06,770
an extra prototype so it's not code you

00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:08,300
can use for anything well you really

00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:10,280
just click upon why I'm just trying to

00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:12,050
figure out if whoever is using that do

00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,400
they have to have a license for that or

00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:15,050
is it just the desktop where your

00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,130
appropriate of producing the demo it's

00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:24,079
just the desktop with that you're

00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:28,579
producing it so what is a format of the

00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:31,010
document that you produce so it is an

00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:34,130
extra is an actor file which the file

00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:37,460
name is RP specifications are generated

00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:41,030
in word and the prototypes themselves

00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:45,099
are generated in HTML ok but when I if I

00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:50,569
want to put out a prototype for comment

00:49:45,099 --> 00:49:52,069
to a specific set of people mm-hmm the

00:49:50,569 --> 00:49:53,660
only way to do that to put it out on

00:49:52,069 --> 00:49:55,910
extra share or can I publish it

00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:57,530
internally um you can publish it you can

00:49:55,910 --> 00:50:00,050
absolutely publish it internally because

00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:03,530
it outputs as HTML files so it just goes

00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:05,300
into yeah so you can load it into an ftp

00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:09,440
server to you can also by the way

00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:13,490
password protect these so let's say that

00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:15,170
you you can't share it outside of

00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:17,420
whatever your

00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:20,390
is you can actually password protect it

00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:23,059
when you send out the when you put out

00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:25,040
the prototype okay and is the only way

00:50:23,059 --> 00:50:26,960
to get comments though is to put it on

00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,819
extra share I don't believe so or I can

00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,950
publish it internally and collect the

00:50:28,819 --> 00:50:35,480
same moment yeah I believe so I have

00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:38,299
more questions about check so I've used

00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:39,740
Xers successfully in a couple client

00:50:38,299 --> 00:50:41,390
engagements but wanting you to talk

00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:43,400
about a couple things so it definitely

00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:46,250
makes your life as a PM or IA your

00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:48,440
expression a lot easier maybe talk about

00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:50,630
managing expectations though with the

00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:52,700
client now who's season one of these

00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:54,349
prototype seems like holy crap that's

00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,670
real easy would note that it assumes

00:50:54,349 --> 00:50:58,970
that they can have been the full website

00:50:55,670 --> 00:51:00,470
just that fast as well and managing

00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:01,819
expectations with a developer because

00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:03,950
you're giving them a different type of

00:51:01,819 --> 00:51:05,450
documentation now it's not a sign

00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:06,619
requirement spreadsheet it's not a use

00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:08,690
case document it's something altogether

00:51:06,619 --> 00:51:11,839
different yeah the way that I usually

00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:14,089
set expectations is you know I use a

00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:16,309
prototyping tool called actor what it

00:51:14,089 --> 00:51:18,460
allows me to do is very quickly generate

00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:20,540
these drag-and-drop prototypes but

00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:23,390
nothing you're going to see here

00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:26,180
interacts with a database nothing like

00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:27,500
there's nothing that the complexity that

00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:29,420
we're actually building the back end of

00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:32,630
the system is not being represented here

00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:35,869
so all of that stuff is going to take

00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:38,750
more time but what this is going to do

00:51:35,869 --> 00:51:41,930
is allow us to use our development time

00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:43,640
in the wisest way possible by knowing

00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:46,579
what we're going to build and settling

00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:49,130
on this is what it's going to be before

00:51:46,579 --> 00:51:51,290
we start building the other thing that I

00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:54,170
do with developers specifically is I

00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:56,299
actually show them my process while I'm

00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:58,130
in the middle of doing it so I will

00:51:56,299 --> 00:51:59,960
actually publish early and often and

00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:03,980
start getting feedback from developers

00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:05,809
as soon as I start doing stuff and say I

00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:07,369
need I need you to look at this and tell

00:52:05,809 --> 00:52:10,040
me if there are any like technical

00:52:07,369 --> 00:52:12,170
realities I'm missing here and that way

00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:14,990
they're very familiar with the prototype

00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:16,400
by the end of the process and I can hand

00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:19,930
it to them and say okay we're ready to

00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,930
go on this piece of it go for it

00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:26,380
I have two questions for you the first

00:52:24,459 --> 00:52:30,729
is why would you recommend pro so much

00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:32,349
over the basic I guess oh so that is the

00:52:30,729 --> 00:52:34,479
reason i recommend pro over basic is

00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:36,459
because outputting specifications is

00:52:34,479 --> 00:52:38,399
only available on basic is only

00:52:36,459 --> 00:52:42,069
available on pro and so is annotating

00:52:38,399 --> 00:52:45,159
and like basic you can you know you can

00:52:42,069 --> 00:52:47,499
use all the functions but really the

00:52:45,159 --> 00:52:49,749
value you get is the annotation and the

00:52:47,499 --> 00:52:51,669
ability to like discuss right in the

00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:53,949
prototype that's the value you get if

00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:55,719
what you're really just looking is for

00:52:53,949 --> 00:52:57,669
something to like create really quick

00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:59,529
mock-ups there are so many other tools

00:52:57,669 --> 00:53:01,689
that can do that even easier than this

00:52:59,529 --> 00:53:03,249
but this really the value is in the

00:53:01,689 --> 00:53:05,559
documentation that you create out of

00:53:03,249 --> 00:53:07,589
that prototype the other question I had

00:53:05,559 --> 00:53:10,869
was you said this was your second best

00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:13,029
purchase oh yes what's the first oh so

00:53:10,869 --> 00:53:15,939
the first best is so this is like

00:53:13,029 --> 00:53:20,140
incredibly nerdy but it's a software

00:53:15,939 --> 00:53:23,229
called nvivo and literally it is for

00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:26,339
analyzing qualitative data and it's like

00:53:23,229 --> 00:53:28,839
this drag-and-drop interface that you

00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:32,139
highlight text and drag it into a thing

00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:35,499
and it's like doing a card sort on your

00:53:32,139 --> 00:53:37,479
laptop with Word documents and it just

00:53:35,499 --> 00:53:42,849
makes my life filled with nerdish glee

00:53:37,479 --> 00:53:45,759
so none of you need that but I do I was

00:53:42,849 --> 00:53:47,829
just wondering on the the published

00:53:45,759 --> 00:53:49,689
online versions that you share with

00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:51,939
people when you when you create comments

00:53:49,689 --> 00:53:54,279
or when people at comments do you get to

00:53:51,939 --> 00:53:56,559
pull that back into the version on your

00:53:54,279 --> 00:53:58,659
machine so that we like is it like when

00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,309
the next time you push a new version out

00:53:58,659 --> 00:54:03,099
are you losing everything that was our

00:54:00,309 --> 00:54:04,599
now so actually so you don't it's not

00:54:03,099 --> 00:54:05,829
necessarily like a pulling it back on

00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:08,949
the machine type of thing everything

00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:11,709
stays with the the everything stays with

00:54:08,949 --> 00:54:14,979
what what was published online which is

00:54:11,709 --> 00:54:16,630
really nice so so I basically what I do

00:54:14,979 --> 00:54:19,389
is I go back to my desk and I start

00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:20,619
looking at the comments so I started

00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:23,709
looking at the comments and sort of

00:54:20,619 --> 00:54:26,799
processing them as I'm iterating and

00:54:23,709 --> 00:54:29,109
then what I might do is when something's

00:54:26,799 --> 00:54:31,899
been addressed I just get rid of the

00:54:29,109 --> 00:54:34,210
comment and I close it because it's been

00:54:31,899 --> 00:54:37,060
involved and it's in the

00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:38,680
type now but when I push up a new

00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:40,060
prototype those comments all stay there

00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:42,430
Oh critical which is really nice and

00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:45,970
just one thing to mention about pro I'm

00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:47,920
a information studies student right now

00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:51,400
and if you can prove a cure that you're

00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:53,290
an aux or design related field and

00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:56,109
currently a student you can get it for

00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:57,880
free I know I learned that after i was a

00:54:56,109 --> 00:55:02,770
student and had purchased that you're

00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:05,710
already hi my shop currently just took

00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:07,240
the dive into using envision app but

00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:09,520
she's really new for us but it is also a

00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:11,500
really robust you know prototyping app

00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,540
yeah i wanted to see if you are familiar

00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:17,020
with it and if actual provides a certain

00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:20,260
benefit / invision for prototyping with

00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:23,320
drupal sure so I would say that I mean

00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:24,910
axure like I don't know I don't know

00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:27,609
that much about envision I just heard

00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:30,940
about it from kevin o'leary a top whea

00:55:27,609 --> 00:55:35,109
um because he uses it a lot and um i

00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:37,510
think both are good okay um what I like

00:55:35,109 --> 00:55:39,430
about actor is again sort of the

00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:42,970
documentation but I think envision work

00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:45,460
what you know has some of that and one

00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:47,530
of the things that I like about actor is

00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:50,470
just again the documentation but also

00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:53,290
just how editable things are okay it's

00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:57,460
really easy to like iterate and add on

00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:59,800
things awesome thank you no problem hi

00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:03,040
Danny um I was wondering if you have any

00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:06,160
good stories about using AXA to test

00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:08,140
with real users yes actually I do as a

00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,730
matter of fact so as a matter of fact

00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:12,730
this is research that's being done at

00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:15,520
the user experience center right now one

00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:18,130
of the things that we just finished was

00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:20,320
a study for a big healthcare company who

00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:22,060
is redesigning their website and what

00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:24,040
they were trying to do was understand

00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:26,530
whether people first of all they were

00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:28,599
concept testing the website and they

00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:30,280
were also testing the information

00:56:28,599 --> 00:56:31,810
architecture navigation and trying to

00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,910
see if people could find their products

00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:38,500
on the website so the website obviously

00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:40,510
was not at all close to done yet but

00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:43,030
what we were able to do was create a

00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:46,180
really high fidelity prototype in actor

00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:46,910
that we used as the basis for our user

00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:49,940
test

00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:53,900
and we discovered a whole host of

00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:55,730
problems that were specific not to like

00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:57,530
the design of the navigation but

00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:58,940
literally to the labels that people were

00:56:57,530 --> 00:57:01,609
using in the way that content was

00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:04,280
organized through the user test and

00:57:01,609 --> 00:57:06,559
actually I would also say that in terms

00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:08,960
of the user studies that we do at the

00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:11,059
user experience center I would say like

00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,240
a good 50 of them out like a good fifty

00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:16,670
percent of them are actual prototypes

00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:19,880
and we've tested like we've tested a lot

00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:24,170
of really high fidelity prototypes but

00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:26,750
now we're doing one of our consultants

00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:32,299
is doing a research study where he is

00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:34,130
using two different levels of fidelity

00:57:32,299 --> 00:57:38,450
with axure a high fidelity and a low

00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:41,690
fidelity and the actual website to sort

00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:44,829
of test how predictive users amiss with

00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:47,930
the three different levels of fidelity

00:57:44,829 --> 00:57:51,260
so yeah it's very very robust for

00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:52,880
testing and you literally you just

00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:54,740
change the way that you generate the

00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,859
specification are the way that you

00:57:54,740 --> 00:58:00,680
generate the prototype online and you

00:57:57,859 --> 00:58:02,960
can send it up without annotations and

00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:04,190
use that for testing and then have

00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,329
another one that you have with the

00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:09,589
annotations that serves as the

00:58:05,329 --> 00:58:11,960
documentation do you run oet run rule

00:58:09,589 --> 00:58:16,010
and usability tests face to face or

00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:17,720
quite um we do no we actually do we do a

00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:21,650
fair amount of remote testing but it's

00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:25,400
usually one on one user zoom we have

00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:27,440
used but it's usually for literally like

00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:29,809
something that someone can do without

00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,089
you sitting there it's really much

00:58:29,809 --> 00:58:35,329
better for like performance testing like

00:58:32,089 --> 00:58:39,079
an the person find this thing in this

00:58:35,329 --> 00:58:40,880
much time as opposed to you know what is

00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:44,059
it you know what do this what does this

00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:46,880
person think this label means yeah it is

00:58:44,059 --> 00:58:50,170
easy to track success using extra little

00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:52,760
DF to add something else on top of it um

00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:54,619
yeah so I mean this really creates the

00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,750
prototype it doesn't create the testing

00:58:54,619 --> 00:58:57,920
environment but you could for example

00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:59,990
use user

00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,630
like you could combine user zoom for

00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:05,829
example with actor an actor prototype

00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:10,369
and track success through users ooh

00:59:05,829 --> 00:59:12,130
thanks no I'm all right so it is too

00:59:10,369 --> 00:59:15,079
which means that we get to take a break

00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:18,650
but then anyone who is interested in has

00:59:15,079 --> 00:59:21,200
their laptops the next part of the

00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:27,140
session is going to be me sort of

00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:35,119
demonstrating how I created the profile

00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:42,740
page and the drupal org in extra so stay

00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:46,339
tuned oh yes and if anyone if anyone

00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:48,950
wants a fun design for drupal postcard

00:59:46,339 --> 00:59:52,089
and submit your session to designed for

00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:52,089
