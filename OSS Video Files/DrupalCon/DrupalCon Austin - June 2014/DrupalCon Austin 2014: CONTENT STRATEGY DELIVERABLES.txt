	Speakers: Snugugsdboyer
Content strategy is the process by which content is analyzed, sorted, constructed, and placed. Users come to a site for its content first and foremost, so it is the most important part of a site. Before any discussion of design or development, an understanding of a product owner's content is imperative in order to produce not only an effective website, but lay an effective foundation for any and all future endeavors, from apps to ads to printed material. The entirety of a finished product is determined by this initial step, from what content actually is put onto pages to what components get built to what the final site looks like.

This talk will provide a high-level overview of the six items that go into creating a project's content strategy, including:

Project Vision
User Personas
Content Inventory
Content Audit
Content modeling
Information Architecture
