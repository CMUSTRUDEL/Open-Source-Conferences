Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: MASTER THE NEW CORE OF DRUPAL 8 NOW: WITH SYMFONY AND SILEX
Publication date: 2014-06-04
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: weaverryan
I'm not a Drupal developer, but I do already know *a lot* about Drupal 8, like how the event system works, what a service is, how it relates to a dependency injection container and how the deepest and darkest of Drupal's request-response workflow looks.

How? Because I use Symfony. And if you want to get a jumpstart on Drupal 8, you should to. In this talk, we'll double the number of tools you have to solve problems (Drupal + Symfony) and start to unlock all the new important concepts. We'll start with Silex (a microframework based on Symfony), graduate to Symfony, and focus on the pieces that are most interesting to a Drupal 8 developer.
