okay hey everyone this is the 215

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:10,590
session media ecosystem in Drupal 8 I

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,599
was labeled doubleheader on your on your

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,839
sessions so hope you're in the right

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:20,609
place yeah so we'll go ahead and get

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:26,010
started to do too and just kind of a

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:29,609
little bit about who we are to hear me

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:36,360
yeah you do my name is Janice I'm

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:40,140
working at examiner moment I started

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,700
with Drupal by coincidence because a

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,739
friend of mine was working at this

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,620
international tennis tournament and he

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,260
was like I need a website and you can do

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,989
it and I was like should I can but I've

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,960
never done one before and that's how i

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:57,030
found Drupal and I've been happy member

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,219
of Drupal community since then I'm also

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,070
maintaining discuss module blah blah

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:08,450
module I was a student for summer of

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:14,790
code na mentoring and yeah that's it and

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:18,960
my name is Dave Reed IRC Drupal all's my

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,549
same name if you need to find me I work

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,549
for la loba as a senior developer right

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:26,100
now and I've been involved with Drupal

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,799
for over nine years now which feels like

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,020
a really really long time I've been

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,170
involved with lots of modules and

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,520
typically noticed the module guy and I

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,619
apparently like to take on really hard

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,860
problems and not ever give up so that's

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,329
why I'm involved with Drupal media so

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,060
I've been working on this for like the

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,430
last four or five years now and it feels

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,840
like it's it's it's been a really long

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,600
fight there's been a lot of great people

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,680
helping along with this including my

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,119
co-presenter but now we're kind of taken

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,820
to starting to take a turn towards

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,509
triple eight and is what we're going to

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,509
talk about so

00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:12,240
all right um so just to kind of a brief

00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,280
why is media important in Drupal I mean

00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,050
I'm pretty sure we all kind of know this

00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,420
section just because it's a really

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,300
important feature people expect that we

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:25,110
get this done right because they want

00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:30,120
this all the time our competitors such

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:31,260
as WordPress our other systems they have

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,930
this out of the box and they do it

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,110
pretty darn well and so Drupal kind of

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,250
usually tends to take a check box when

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,390
doing in comparison to other systems

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:45,060
with this for media and asset handling

00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:46,680
and that those people are enterprise

00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,239
clients to those are big clients those

00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,880
are big people we could have under poll

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,790
I would hate for media to be the reason

00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,560
why those people don't pick Drupal so

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,640
it's why we need to keep moving forward

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,400
and get something get a good solution

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,120
knowing people use media a lot

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,070
surprisingly I don't know why this

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,890
happens but people like pictures and

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,570
video and audio so people expect to be

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,980
able to use this on their site so it's

00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:14,519
kind of a critical thing you know along

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:18,900
with content creation so we need to get

00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:20,580
it needs to happen and you know people

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,470
that actually do the content creation on

00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,239
the site you know they don't want to be

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,880
too burdened by the workflow it needs to

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,230
be an easy workflow and it needs to be

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,890
something they can understand as well

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,630
and just kind of to encompass that all

00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,549
we need to handle the media itself well

00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,459
we need to treat it like a first class

00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:40,739
citizen you know make sure we're

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:45,150
allowing some you know people to add

00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:48,209
metadata about the the media as well all

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:51,630
those kind of good things and and of

00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:53,459
course the great quote by drees if I

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,900
guess not my fingers and add one single

00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,579
feature to Drupal core it would be good

00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,590
media handling and he said that in

00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:02,420
Portland and he said it for like every

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:04,860
drupalcon before then and after them too

00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:09,600
so it's always been like high on the

00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:12,340
list yeah so drupal 8 is approaching

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,500
vita and we

00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:18,079
we should have something in Drupal 8

00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,299
right because you know features that

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,270
were edits were edit and we're basically

00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:26,320
done with that oh thanks so yeah we

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:29,780
actually have few things in Drupal 8

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:34,160
that improved in core one of them is a

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:36,110
file listing that is there by default it

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,370
looks similar to content listing it

00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:43,310
tells you which files you uploaded true

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,780
image and five fields and what are those

00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:50,510
files used so you have kind of a track

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:52,460
what's going on you can't do much more

00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:55,639
with it but it's a view so it's

00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:59,449
extendable which means we can extend it

00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:04,000
in contribute for needs of your site

00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:07,310
something like that another thing is

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,460
with the wake integration we can

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:13,280
actually add inline images to WYSIWYG

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:18,919
now it works great support captions

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:21,500
alignment and yeah but the only downside

00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:26,599
is it can only embed images you cannot

00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:30,639
embed a video or something else yeah

00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:34,280
yeah yeah because it uses this data

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:37,789
attributes and then when an entity is

00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,800
saved it checks all the body like text

00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:45,620
area fields and looks for these data

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:50,770
attributes and 13 is multi upload by

00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:54,500
default we added like bound multiple

00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:56,780
attribute to file and managed file for

00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,960
maybe I elements so you can use

00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,849
multiupload in your own forms and of

00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,700
course then we also implemented it for

00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:07,490
image and file fields if you have a

00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:10,430
multi value file field you can now just

00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:13,940
go and select more than one file and it

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:16,729
should work it uses html5 multiple

00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:19,950
attribute so it won't work on the

00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:23,220
beloved browsers of older

00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:28,770
but it still tag relates gracefully to

00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:33,630
single upload so it still works yeah so

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:37,680
a a little bit of history a Drupal com

00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:41,310
prog that happened last autumn we had a

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:45,270
conversation and sprint where we started

00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:55,710
to discuss how media in in in Drupal 8

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:57,720
should be approached so it was a more

00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:00,050
like planning sprint we didn't produce

00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:05,370
any codes we just came up with a plan

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:07,770
and like five simple bullet points of

00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:11,040
this plan would be we need to focus on

00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:13,920
user views we should support multiupload

00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:17,160
by default we should have nice wizardry

00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:21,930
integration maybe drag and drop things

00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:26,070
like that we decided to go with

00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:29,160
pluggable framework because in Drupal 7

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:32,910
now we have like several media solutions

00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,130
and none of them like integrate between

00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:37,260
each other which means that we have to

00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:40,290
re-implement a lot of code several times

00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:43,050
if we would have a pluggable framework

00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:45,860
where these different media solutions

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:49,220
could peek these components and use them

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:52,410
that would help a lot because we would

00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,930
develop like code that does something

00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:58,170
just once there would be no need to

00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:00,090
write redundant code and it seems that

00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:02,460
doing a pluggable framework of the

00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:06,720
coupled components would help us to

00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:10,770
solve that of course one of the problems

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:15,000
in t7 was that like pretty much solid

00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:18,780
solutions came out very early in the d7

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,970
life cycle so we should probably fix

00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,700
that and deliver at least basic

00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:28,400
components very soon in the eighth life

00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:31,120
cycle and actually decoupling things

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,940
should help us with that because

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,710
we will be able to bring on board all

00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,810
the developers of different solutions

00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,909
that were competing before to work on

00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:42,760
this same components and this way we

00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:47,500
will hopefully get more resources to

00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:49,960
work in this and of course API is in the

00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,920
eighth are much much more about powerful

00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,510
there than in d7 and we want to use

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,990
existing tools as much as we can because

00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:01,900
that means less work for us better

00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:07,470
integration with some other solutions

00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:10,990
that my appear during life cycle so yeah

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:14,529
and the last step it was decided in

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:19,300
Prague is that we should go with non

00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:26,170
file centric storage component if try to

00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:28,680
explain that so into this 7 we have two

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:31,240
approaches basically how we store files

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:34,510
one approach is file entity approach

00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:37,690
which takes course files which are

00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:40,630
actually entities but probably not many

00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:43,120
people know that they are and extend it

00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:45,550
to be a real entity with fields and

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:49,360
everything and the other approach which

00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:52,709
is also it is implemented right now in

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:57,339
some decent solutions is to go with some

00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:58,870
other entity that doesn't doesn't assume

00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:02,140
that everything will be local file

00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:04,980
because a file is died too far managed

00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:07,330
table and she has to use wrappers and

00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,270
some people think that this is not very

00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:13,330
convenient for remote media like YouTube

00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:17,830
videos and female and stuff like that

00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:21,730
some people some people some people so

00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:25,660
yeah this was a decision and yeah we had

00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:27,430
the points Rebecca fluted so it was kind

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,310
of interesting because i did not get to

00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:32,650
attend drupalcon prague so it was you

00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:34,150
know i had an interesting viewpoint

00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:37,330
being able to follow what kind of what's

00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:38,950
going on from the sideline and and the

00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:41,230
the team that was there can i've had

00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:43,089
this perspective of you know if we could

00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,329
start over from fresh what would we do i

00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:47,779
think that's kind of a

00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:50,059
a good perspective to take especially

00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:52,129
whenever you introduce a new Drupal

00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:54,319
major version especially if you're like

00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:58,189
on Drupal 8 which has all these new

00:10:54,319 --> 00:11:00,439
things and great things my perspective

00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:03,049
comes more along the lines of working

00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:05,360
with the file entity and media modules

00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:07,399
for such a long time I think they're a

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,389
great solution and solve all these

00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:13,579
problems and you know we wanted to we

00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:14,799
had this plan to continue porting them

00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:19,009
to Drupal 8 we didn't really have

00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:20,689
anything to well structured but we kind

00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:24,019
of wanted to go with it but we also

00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:25,489
recognize that we are not doing some

00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:26,540
things ideally so we wanted to take a

00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:30,139
look at some things that we wanted to

00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:33,559
fix and use the Drupal 8 cycle as an

00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:35,209
opportunity to fix them I mean first off

00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,730
the bat we don't have a stable 2x

00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:39,259
release of media module so like how can

00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,869
we start porting something if we don't

00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:42,949
even have it officially released yet

00:11:40,869 --> 00:11:46,790
it's just kind of a big community

00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:48,679
pressure there wysiwyg has always been

00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:51,290
kind of a big issue for media module

00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:56,119
because we have to support the WYSIWYG

00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:59,989
module or ckeditor or tiny MCE or any

00:11:56,119 --> 00:12:01,999
kind of various but you know wysiwyg

00:11:59,989 --> 00:12:04,009
that comes up or it's integrated through

00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:06,980
the WYSIWYG module and that tends to be

00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:09,649
very problematic and we're using you

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,149
know a special syntax to embed the the

00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:13,819
media which doesn't exactly work because

00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:17,540
it's not actually HTML and there's just

00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:19,339
lots of issues going on there I would

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,919
describe it as overly complex out of the

00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:24,470
box that can be seen as a good thing or

00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:25,549
a bad thing you know I think probably

00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,759
the thing that we struggle with the most

00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:30,019
is configuring how to display the files

00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,480
with the media module that's kind of our

00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:34,160
biggest step and that always seems to

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,989
get people hung up but like once you

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,509
understand that it makes it you can see

00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:40,369
how complex and powerful it is to you

00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,720
know we don't we don't know how that

00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:45,559
goes any with any other models like

00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,239
views or panels either and media tends

00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:49,850
to have an uphill battle against core

00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:51,589
assumptions like core assumes that files

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,499
are used only once they're locally

00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:55,850
uploaded files and that's it but we

00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:57,670
wanted to reuse that because it already

00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:01,030
can have provided this framework for us

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,620
extend core doesn't sometimes like to

00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:06,070
have things extend it that way so that's

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:07,690
kind of where things happen you know

00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:10,590
making sure that we have multiple

00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:13,810
uploads the multiupload workflow kind of

00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:15,970
enhanced everywhere right now it's kind

00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:18,040
of like you know it's it's single upload

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,470
but if you have the plupload module and

00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,970
the multi for module then you can do

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,430
multiple uploads and multiple editing

00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:26,980
but does it work properly all the time

00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,890
that kind of thing so like we're having

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,780
to battle two different workflows there

00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:33,370
we've had to battle accessibility making

00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:36,070
sure that we support alt and title tags

00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:39,630
properly with images and content all the

00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:42,640
time that's always a hard one to think

00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:45,400
and again it comes down to usability

00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:48,160
versus extensibility like it's a very

00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,920
very tough line to walk especially for

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,630
such a large module like this and we

00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,620
have a problem figuring out what that

00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:58,360
balance is and you know sustain maintain

00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,160
ership there are lots of really great

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,790
maintained errs for the module some of

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,350
them are in this room Devon who really

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,490
do a great job keeping it going but it's

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:09,250
really hard because it's still a

00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:11,230
volunteer effort I know ah Clea does put

00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,210
some time into it with their comments

00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:16,870
and demo teams which has been very

00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:19,720
helpful but there's no like lead driver

00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:22,600
of it and it kind of just is when people

00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,610
have the time to fix it so that is kind

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,310
of a trouble for us right now too but

00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,930
it's also been 34 years in the making

00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:33,700
and those people are kind of tired of

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:35,590
trying to fix the same thing so yeah and

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,410
there's more I make it sound really

00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:43,450
really bad but really it's a good module

00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:47,320
and I swear I'm just tend to be a

00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:49,780
pessimist that's all so I kind of put

00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,920
together this document where we'd kind

00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,330
of okay here's all the problems we're

00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,370
facing here's how we could maybe start

00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,060
tackling them for Drupal 8 and I kind of

00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,090
shared it with some of the other

00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:00,130
maintained errs you know with your boy

00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:01,690
we can kind of focus on involving this

00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,000
better workflow from day one involving

00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:06,220
accessibility from day one kind of

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,350
splitting up the file entity module so

00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,240
that maybe files don't have to be feel

00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,139
double by default it just it maybe

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,389
that's

00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:15,730
people can optionally enable if they

00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:17,309
want it it kind of has the same theme as

00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:19,509
what the Prague team did you know

00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:21,309
decoupling and kind of making sure that

00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:24,339
these features are more abstract and can

00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:26,259
be reusable where with the media module

00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:29,410
we kind of had these two big modules

00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:30,939
that did it most of the work so we

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,169
wanted to kind of split that up and so

00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:34,389
that's kind of where we were looking at

00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:36,189
and we didn't really have any progress

00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:41,649
to show for that yet but that's where we

00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:45,669
were headed so after the Prague sprint

00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:46,959
there was a GDO post put out where they

00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:49,359
are like okay here's what we want to do

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,279
we want to have this this separate media

00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:55,419
entity and it doesn't have to be a file

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:59,049
and here's our proposal and you know I'm

00:15:55,419 --> 00:16:02,139
going to be admit that as a file entity

00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:03,970
maintainer I didn't take it well we were

00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:06,459
we were respectful but we were very

00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,499
disagreeing on how that should move

00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:10,029
forward and we tend to get I think we

00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:12,100
got a little bit muddled in like the

00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:13,929
very details like no there should be

00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,089
files no they should be separate media

00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:19,959
entities and like that was really the

00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:22,779
gist of our argument huge tread and it

00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:23,980
seems stuck yeah so they kind of stuck

00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:25,209
our progress for a little bit and that's

00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,799
kind of why we have the double header

00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:30,119
right now because we were both competing

00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:33,309
offering competing core conversations

00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:38,939
but we they both got accepted because

00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:38,939
there's a nice revolution to this I

00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:46,209
think I was going to go on this one okay

00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:50,019
so we had a sprint at nice camp in New

00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:51,459
York City I was invited to come I was I

00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:52,809
was strongly encouraged to come because

00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:54,970
they were getting they really like to

00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:58,059
get members of the media group together

00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:59,860
and I'm not gonna lie I was really

00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:03,039
hesitant about going I did not want to

00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:05,919
go because we had this this conflict

00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:07,089
over storage and just I've been involved

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,919
in media so long I starting to get

00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:11,709
really frustrated and like I didn't want

00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:16,539
to help I was I was getting close to

00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:19,089
abandoning the effort but I convinced me

00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:21,129
to come and we had this great group of

00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:22,510
people here that were there and we kind

00:17:21,129 --> 00:17:24,730
of locked ourselves in a little board

00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:27,850
room in the UN

00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:29,710
for an afternoon and we're like okay it

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,960
was actually quite a good venue for

00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,309
something it was a great venue yeah it's

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,549
a good place to get locked up but there

00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:39,240
also is lots of security there yeah that

00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:41,980
wasn't no guns and stuff as interesting

00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,410
so we sat down and we grabbed a white

00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:46,059
border like a okay what are the common

00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,620
components that we need like what's

00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:49,809
let's figure out what we both need

00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,429
what's maybe just not agree about how

00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:52,809
things are stored they can be files they

00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:55,330
can be media entities maybe that's a

00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:57,669
good thing that we don't agree on that

00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:59,950
because it forces us to find where we

00:17:57,669 --> 00:18:02,710
can meet our common needs how where r UI

00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:06,850
elements intersect and we can work on

00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:08,380
those together so that's what we did

00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,299
we're going to keep working on our two

00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,400
separate storage components so it's very

00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:14,890
likely that we'll have file entity and

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,340
media entity in Drupal 8 we'll see how

00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:21,130
that goes so yeah we're in continuing

00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,410
with that but we're going to make sure

00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:26,230
that we work on these independent parts

00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:27,730
together as a common goal because if we

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,559
can get them to work for both of our

00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,480
storage parts they should work for

00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:35,080
anyone and that's kind of what we're

00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,760
Tate we're going with there and because

00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,280
we're you know going to look at it from

00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,020
files or immediate entity approach you

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,049
should be use this be able to use this

00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:46,179
approach with nodes or anything else

00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:48,040
you'd like to that's an entity like

00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:49,870
we're something kind of a lofty goal

00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,700
here like the things that we're doing we

00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:55,120
want to make available for any entity

00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:57,970
type so our embedding component where

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,470
what we're calling entity in bed you

00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,570
should be able to embed any kind of

00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:03,370
entity type in your was a big field

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:08,470
we're going to solve it for everything

00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:11,230
it's yeah we're ambitious and this is a

00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:13,450
summer of code project and sorry you

00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:17,710
want to say that no that's good and it's

00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:20,980
going very well I mean like I'm betting

00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:23,350
it already works basically we are

00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:26,559
waiting for a core patch to to be

00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:29,430
committed and it's now basically just

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:33,560
the integration with CP editor

00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:36,300
making making it look and no work nice

00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,550
like and just because we're able to take

00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,930
a look at it from the ground up now like

00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,910
all the problems that we usually have

00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:43,680
like I think one of the number one

00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:46,110
requests we get in the media issue queue

00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:49,980
is like I want to embed a link to my

00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:52,560
file in the WYSIWYG that's like use case

00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:55,020
number two and we don't really have a

00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,880
good solution for that at times we may

00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,000
have it fixed now but like it works out

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,340
a box with this new solution which is

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,320
really great I'm also going to have an

00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,500
entity browser component so that's going

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,540
to be your selection of the entities

00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,700
viewing them the kind of the tabbed

00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,500
interface for do I want to upload or do

00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,750
I want to select where do I want to use

00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,710
a file from the web that's going to be

00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:22,650
the entity browser and I kind of had a

00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:25,260
really fun revelation in New York that

00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:28,260
like these individual tabs in the

00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:30,660
browser we're doing a lot of work to

00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:33,390
make those and they're just selecting

00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,040
things there's existing core

00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:38,100
functionality that does this they're

00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,260
called widgets and why don't we just

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,970
make anything that gets used in the

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:45,360
browser tab Oh make sure it's available

00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:46,980
as a widget first and then we can just

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,950
easily bring it all together so it's

00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,710
like having a view of files you should

00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:56,250
be able to use that with a file field

00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:59,040
itself and not using media like and it

00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:01,020
folks who focuses makes us focus on the

00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:04,230
usability of each component each user

00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:05,910
interface of that so like the the upload

00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,860
or web UI where you to paste in a URL

00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:10,410
that should be a widget you can use on a

00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,360
file field and it also makes those

00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:14,300
components reusable outside of the media

00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,260
ecosystem so you could use that

00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,640
independently if you wanted to on your

00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,340
project and I think that's a really

00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,950
really great solution forward another

00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,660
interesting thing the file entity the

00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,910
way that me manage file displays you're

00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,250
like try youtube first and if that

00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:31,620
doesn't work try an html5 video player

00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:34,050
first and then if that falls back try a

00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:37,500
generic file link like it try has this

00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:39,840
fall back method we're actually

00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,240
abstracting that into its own for matter

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,909
so you have a formatter that you say

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,229
well try

00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:46,119
this first and that didn't work try this

00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:48,369
and you can manage it right from the

00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:50,919
manage display screen and anything else

00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:57,879
can use this too so that's just a really

00:21:50,919 --> 00:22:01,929
nice solution forward as well yeah so we

00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:06,460
have a roadmap we don't have like

00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:12,669
delivery dates yet but it like basically

00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:17,049
in step one we need wysiwyg embeds do

00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:21,460
the basic api's namely we need the text

00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:23,769
filter that converts like this Dom

00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:26,889
elements with data attributes to the

00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:31,119
actual rendered node or I mean any

00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:34,690
entity we need entity browser that like

00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:39,249
has basic API in a working demo storage

00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:42,309
components are crucial part and plugins

00:22:39,249 --> 00:22:45,099
system for these steps that that they've

00:22:42,309 --> 00:22:51,700
mentioned for your browser thing then in

00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:56,379
step two we have to focus on the UI UX

00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:58,690
of the embedding module and we're

00:22:56,379 --> 00:23:00,849
actually already working on that so

00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:06,129
we're on step two when it comes to

00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:08,739
embedding we hope to have like at least

00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:12,489
part of step one of entity browser done

00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:14,919
here this week and when both systems are

00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:17,320
working we have to like try to integrate

00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:20,409
those so you would be able to use entity

00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:23,019
browser to actually select entities

00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:24,549
which are supposed to be embedded away

00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:26,859
the way yeah because right now it's just

00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:28,599
like a simple what type of entity are

00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:30,639
you emitting a select box and like type

00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:31,779
in the ID which is of course not the

00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:33,909
ideal thing we want to make sure that

00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:36,549
when entity browser is available we use

00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:41,440
that to select from the entity embedding

00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:44,590
so and when entity browser is basically

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:48,840
done then we want to use it to actually

00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,840
create media library

00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:57,160
and then a step tree we do more like

00:23:54,670 --> 00:24:00,840
things that are very nice to have but

00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:03,400
not crucial for system to work like

00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,740
multiupload and the display

00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,500
configuration things like that and at

00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,240
the end we then plan to work on

00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:18,130
third-party integrations about being

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:20,020
derivatives so this all sounds like a

00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:23,679
really great plan and I can see that

00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:26,380
you're all really enthused about it but

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,360
we actually I'm going to pull out the

00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,490
pessimist part of me again we're gonna

00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,870
say hello to him yes because there's

00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:34,570
still some challenges that we face in

00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,800
Drupal 8 to make this happen you know

00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:37,780
we're feeling pretty confident we can

00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,270
get this done with this plan in place

00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:41,860
and kind of focusing on the individual

00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:44,559
parts but allowing them to work together

00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,910
really well so I just kind of sentences

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,460
a core conversation I wanted to make

00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:50,440
sure i bring up like hey what's still

00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:52,929
left in Drupal 8 that could really help

00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,370
unblock us kind of a thing so if there's

00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:56,140
any core developers in the room this is

00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:58,059
one you should really if especially pay

00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:01,929
attention to and help us out at the code

00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:04,090
sprint on Friday so kind of the big one

00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:05,380
that I think everyone should come to pay

00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:08,830
attention to is how do we manage

00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:11,020
dependencies for contribs how do we

00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:14,290
require the plupload library in our

00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:18,660
module right now there's no way for us

00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:21,250
to manage that composer is used for core

00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:29,590
but core also includes all the files

00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:31,330
that it needs is contribute we need to

00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:33,610
have those available right away and

00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:35,890
without any without any difficulty to

00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:39,400
download and set them up so we need to

00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:41,620
focus on that there's a really

00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,540
interesting problem in core I you may

00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:46,540
have heard Larry or other people talk

00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:49,750
about like we're decoupling core and all

00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:51,220
those good terms but the fact is when

00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:53,130
you actually try to use stuff that

00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,820
should be dumped decoupled it's not

00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:58,210
which is kind of an interesting

00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:01,510
situation with your point like our plan

00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:01,980
to use widgets without actually having a

00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,820
real

00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:07,820
filled in in the browser we want to make

00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:10,350
sure that that actually can is possible

00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:13,080
we've had a real struggle getting for

00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:15,330
matters to work without a field saying

00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,790
just given an entity I want to render it

00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:21,000
as the entity label entity reference for

00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:23,730
matter there's actually a lot of messy

00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,330
code to get that to work so there's

00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:29,809
actually some issues there my and stuff

00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:33,419
like the links on your node and comments

00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:35,340
if you want to hide those when you're

00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:37,770
embedding a node you can't actually do

00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:40,350
that there you can't manage them in the

00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:41,370
display they're just always visible so

00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:44,490
we want to make sure that things are

00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:48,510
just nicely done and that kind it's kind

00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:51,210
of more of a higher level 1 files in

00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:53,309
Drupal 8 this is kind of from the file

00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:57,510
entity side of things they lack a proper

00:26:53,309 --> 00:27:00,049
access controller so Drupal 8 introduced

00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:02,309
a new kind of standardized entity access

00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:04,980
method but it doesn't actually work for

00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:07,440
files so if you try and call those

00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,500
methods it just returns false which is

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,580
great because we want to see our files

00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,540
so that's an interesting one that we

00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:17,190
probably are going to be working on on

00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:18,750
Friday probably the most challenging

00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:22,440
parts I've encountered so far or typed

00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:24,750
data and plugins if you have a file with

00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,030
the space in the name it fails tours

00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:33,240
validation to be a complete file entity

00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:34,830
which is a issue and you know say if you

00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,049
have a set of plugins so like the ways

00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:39,480
that our entity is rendered using the

00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:40,950
embedding stuff you can either pick like

00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,890
you know use a view mode or use a

00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:46,590
formatter or use a file format or use an

00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:49,820
image for matter those are actually all

00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:52,890
plugins and it would be nice to have a

00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:55,080
plug-in contact system that said hey

00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:58,340
given that I've provided you a node

00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:00,510
entity which plugins could work on this

00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:02,280
and there's an issue for that in the

00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,750
core that Tim Plunkett just posted a

00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:07,590
couple days ago and that would be nice

00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:10,950
to have one of the biggest things that

00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:14,730
plagued us was one of these core

00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:15,900
assumptions that if you've uploaded a

00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,840
file to Drupal used it

00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,910
field and may be removed that file and

00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,500
swapped it out for something else six

00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:25,590
hours later Drupal will delete that old

00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,480
file for you which becomes a problem

00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:30,300
when you want to add the concept of a

00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,300
reusable media framework to Drupal once

00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:35,520
the people stuff starts to go missing

00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:38,600
when they know they uploaded it and this

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:41,670
we actually fixed in nice camp so yay

00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:46,560
we're happy about that it's no longer

00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:50,640
Chelsea I'm positive for once don't

00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:54,810
encourage me so yeah now we're going to

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:57,240
turn back positive yeah so we have a

00:28:54,810 --> 00:29:00,810
plan we hope and believe that you like

00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:05,340
it but there is obviously a lot of work

00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:08,280
to be done and we need your help if

00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:13,350
you're interested in media if you are a

00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:16,890
webshop that uses media solutions and

00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:21,650
it's not happy with them and we you want

00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:21,650
to help us improve it you should join us

00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:29,910
so we need people of all sorts of

00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:32,880
experience we will need a lot of

00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:36,120
front-end work because a lot of most of

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,920
the pub flow part is actually front-end

00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,710
a lot of JavaScript and making this

00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:43,590
things work we need user experience

00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:48,270
professionals to advise us about how to

00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:52,650
design this flows we also need back and

00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:55,380
devs project managers so there if you

00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:58,020
have interest to help there is something

00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:01,500
you we can give you or you can give us

00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:03,800
so don't say I'm not I don't have skills

00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:07,050
for that I'd actually love to point out

00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:09,750
typically Drupal core initiatives have

00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:11,460
what's called an initiative lead who's

00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,200
kind of like the project manager for

00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:16,260
that initiative that helps drive

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,060
development communicate things all those

00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:21,570
sorts of fun kind of project manager

00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:23,400
tasks I have been acting kind of in that

00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:25,440
role but I also recognize that I am a

00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:28,170
developer so I think we're probably

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,250
going to look for like someone who can

00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:32,610
be a good kind of

00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:34,170
media initiative lead so if you're

00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:35,280
interested in that or know someone who

00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:40,380
might be just than that that would be

00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:44,490
great yeah and we definitely want to

00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:48,930
hear from you last week I I was pained

00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:51,330
by web flow is a drupal developer from

00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:53,010
germany and he was like hey I'm using

00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:56,550
entity embed and a project that's going

00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:59,550
out like a few days and I was like

00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:02,340
really and we had a call and he showed

00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:05,760
me how they integrated entity in bed

00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:08,040
with WYSIWYG and and how are they

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:12,030
embedding stuff into body and I was like

00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:17,010
wow this is great and what you mean need

00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:20,850
3.8 code yeah oh okay yeah wow it's

00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:22,830
probably already released by now and I

00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:25,770
was like this is great and we can use

00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:28,110
most of your coat can you push this to

00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:30,240
github and he said yes of course and

00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:31,770
then we paying at our student that he's

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,350
working on this stuff and we said you

00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:36,330
have code there that basically does what

00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:40,380
you want implement so go there and check

00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:42,150
here then like maybe reef luxury free

00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,970
video factory it a little bit and that's

00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:47,790
it so yeah if you're doing this kind of

00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:52,800
things let us know because if you'll be

00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:54,780
hiding your coat at home then we will

00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,040
not improve this I know at least one of

00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,320
you in this room has probably written

00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,780
their own media like asset management

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:05,220
system and if you have you should

00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:08,310
probably talk to us and another thing

00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:10,470
that I that I realized by discussing

00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:14,910
with web flow was they are actually

00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:18,090
using entity embed to embed non media

00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:20,370
entities also so that proves that a

00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:23,190
generalized approach that we're taking

00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:26,190
about supporting all entities is the

00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:28,800
right way to go because I mean it works

00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:31,280
great for them I don't have stuff

00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,280
recorded

00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:40,070
yeah that with entity in bed anything is

00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:45,740
that's an entity can be embedded

00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:45,740
anything blocks users taxonomy terms

00:32:53,560 --> 00:33:00,820
from the wysiwyg standpoint yes yeah so

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,210
there are a few channels where you can

00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:06,990
get involved we have a group on GDL we

00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:11,020
have weekly scrum meetings on hang out

00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:13,830
we announce them on the gdo group so if

00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:17,410
you follow that one you should be fine

00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:19,300
there are a few projects it's entity

00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:23,580
browser entity in bed for back for

00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:26,970
matter media entities media file entity

00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:29,950
so you can go and check the issue cuse

00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:33,510
media entity is that non file Cedric

00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:38,860
storage component it's actually there is

00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:43,990
v8 code already and it's also being

00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:48,400
already used in some sites we are an IRC

00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:51,220
on bound rupal dash media you can

00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:55,930
contact us directly and we will forward

00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:59,080
you you can come help us on Friday

00:33:55,930 --> 00:34:01,990
sprint or in Amsterdam or if you want to

00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,480
organize a sprint let us know we will

00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:07,930
see if somebody from the media team can

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:10,930
help can come and help on site otherwise

00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:12,820
we can join remotely just the most

00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:15,190
important thing is communicated with us

00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:18,970
let us know what's going on so we can

00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:21,630
cooperate and use our resources in the

00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:21,630
most efficient way

00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:27,310
and yeah I think it's time for Q&A yeah

00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,780
well we'll open up the QA and then if we

00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:30,640
have a little bit of time I can just

00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:33,940
show a live demo of entity in bed if

00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:37,540
anyone wants to see it and please

00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:41,440
evaluate this session if you go to like

00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:44,470
double-headed session where both of our

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,070
sessions are listed pick the first one

00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:51,010
which is about media file entity and

00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:52,840
evaluate it as a one session and then we

00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:54,460
will share results yeah because do the

00:34:52,840 --> 00:35:04,030
order of the sessions is not at all who

00:34:54,460 --> 00:35:07,930
won so yeah thanks all right first

00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:09,850
question for just working okay first I

00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:13,000
want to thank you too and the team in

00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:14,560
general and in the past and all these

00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,880
years that the media model has been in

00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,650
existence I know it's been a rough road

00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,600
from the other side of the fence wanting

00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,770
to use the module internally it's

00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,930
interesting to hear that story so

00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:25,600
congratulations on getting through all

00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:28,600
that moving forward I'm very interested

00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:31,030
in the idea of using the whole editing

00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:33,430
embed aspect because like this gentleman

00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:35,920
here mentioned you know blocks we use

00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:37,780
field collections I'm done and with the

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,310
idea of you know we really need to be

00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:42,280
chunking data instead of blobbing

00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:44,410
blobbing content rather being able to

00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,050
define field collections and all that

00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:48,880
sorts of things including you know

00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:51,220
images and YouTube videos and all that

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,460
and being able to move it around the

00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:56,410
page within a body field is going to be

00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,180
extremely handy while still you know

00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:00,520
making it pretty simple to keep sites

00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:02,650
responsive or you know multi multi

00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:05,410
display friendly so I just wanted to

00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:06,700
echo that and wanted to understand I

00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:08,560
know that you're moving forward this on

00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:10,360
Drupal 8 won't understand what

00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,210
possibilities are still are out there

00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:15,480
for Drupal 7 to make use of some of

00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:17,830
these things you're doing 48 um well I

00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,870
that's a great question and thank you

00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:21,310
the fall back for matter is actually

00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:23,950
written for Drupal 7 right now just

00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:25,540
because I know that best but it will be

00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:29,110
ported to Drupal 8 so that could be used

00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:32,130
right now I am thinking that possibly

00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:34,810
we'll be able to backport entity in bed

00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:35,710
maybe a more just lightweight solution

00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:37,810
that doesn't use

00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:39,730
the entity browsers and that will be a

00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:43,210
much more manageable effort or much more

00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:44,710
larger effort to backport I don't see

00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:50,560
reason why we can't backport entity in

00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:53,020
bed it's a matter of time so yeah yes

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,660
guys diva I've got a question about one

00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:58,990
of the problems you highlighted the idea

00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:01,359
that field for matters can't be used for

00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:04,080
things other than fields one of the

00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:06,369
themes I've heard around Drupal 8 is

00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:08,980
encapsulating logic so the idea that

00:37:06,369 --> 00:37:12,700
page controllers should do little more

00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:14,680
than make a call to something else form

00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:17,859
submit functions should do little more

00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:19,990
than make an API call so that the logic

00:37:17,859 --> 00:37:21,940
within is not tied to this one

00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:23,680
implementation I'm thinking of this

00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,930
problem of field for matters in a

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,420
similar way that field for matters

00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:32,290
probably shouldn't contain too much

00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:36,130
logic so in the case of a file field for

00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:38,130
matter that logic for displaying a file

00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:40,900
should probably in it be in its own

00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:43,240
encapsulated area with a field for

00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:46,810
matter saying little more than I want

00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:49,720
this file entity rendered in this way do

00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:51,070
you see the problem the same way um the

00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,900
problem isn't actually in the for

00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:55,420
matters themselves those are actually

00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:57,609
pretty good like given the right

00:37:55,420 --> 00:38:00,220
information like I want to I'm i have

00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:02,380
this entity i'm giving i'm giving you it

00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:04,030
and i am giving you this array of

00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,820
configuration which corresponds to the

00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:10,300
formatter settings like that's ideally

00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:12,280
what it should work with and I that

00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:15,820
should be the ideal way but it requires

00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:18,010
like typed data listing of the entity to

00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:21,849
be passed in and a fake field to be

00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:24,430
created of the proper field type and

00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:27,940
it's mostly the underlying stuff not the

00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:30,670
formatter itself yeah yeah so I guess I

00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:33,940
see this problem as field for matters

00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:36,730
are maybe the only place where we can do

00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:40,089
that kind of configuration of display

00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:42,040
logic so is there than a need to move

00:38:40,089 --> 00:38:44,830
that configuration of display logic a

00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:47,810
layer of abstraction out so that fields

00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:51,810
are just implementing that rather than

00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:54,270
making fake fields I would hope so okay

00:38:51,810 --> 00:39:01,500
I would love that yeah okay yeah thanks

00:38:54,270 --> 00:39:04,560
hmm hey hi thanks again for the

00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,570
presentation everything y'all do what

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:12,710
the relationship between the media team

00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:15,840
and scald mm-hmm um that's kind of so

00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:17,400
I've been in touch with Scott guys a lot

00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:20,600
because just because of the fact that

00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:24,210
one of the founders of the company that

00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:27,060
works on this module is based in the

00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:29,490
same country as I am his French but he

00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:33,230
moved to Slovenia so his regularly

00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:36,180
participating our meetups and stuff and

00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:39,390
one thing that I I've been really trying

00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:43,320
to achieve for d 8 is like bringing all

00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:45,870
these people together and it always sup

00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:48,990
if it always ended up just in a

00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:51,450
discussion about this storage component

00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:53,670
which is kind of stupid right because it

00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:56,450
at the end of the day it doesn't really

00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:59,520
matter because we can probably achieve

00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:01,980
everything we want with either file

00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,110
entity or media entities it's more

00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:10,890
probably more emotional discussion than

00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:14,250
anything else and so they are happy with

00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:18,180
this a project were taken so basically

00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:21,630
media entity goes with the approach that

00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:25,830
they had in his calls for storage in the

00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:28,830
seven and they're helping on this other

00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:31,200
components so I think this breakthrough

00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:34,230
New York really helped us to come on the

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:37,110
same boat so and I'm very enthusiastic

00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:39,030
about it yeah we had one of the this

00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:42,180
called maintain errs in New York City

00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:45,480
and he's also working on the entity

00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:49,560
browser component so like it's it was

00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:51,150
kind of a really good benefit of the New

00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,040
York sprint that I didn't see coming

00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:55,440
into it was getting all these parties

00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,820
involved and unified with the same

00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,310
effort because we're wasting a lot of

00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,839
resources unlike you said kind of doing

00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:03,539
all the same thing but doing it

00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:05,609
differently just very slightly so yeah

00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:08,269
it we're glad to have them on board as

00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:11,039
long as they all look allow it so a

00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:13,170
little probably still end up having

00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,210
maybe twenty percent of redundant code

00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:21,359
but this is much better than one hundred

00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:23,999
percent right yeah hi there right now

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:27,690
I'm working on very large installation

00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:29,519
of Drupal 7 thousands of sites running

00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:32,969
on one and multi-site set up right now

00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:35,460
we're using media one point oh and I'm

00:41:32,969 --> 00:41:37,319
very wasn't watching the media blockers

00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,420
for two point oh four last about a year

00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:41,910
and a half we have a ticket into the

00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,019
let's upgrade to two points but we're

00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:45,569
not that and one of what we're talking

00:41:43,019 --> 00:41:47,969
about today whether we branching off now

00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:51,029
two or 3x media with all these changes

00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:55,229
you're making or are we still focusing

00:41:51,029 --> 00:41:56,640
on finishing the 2x blockers um I want

00:41:55,229 --> 00:41:59,609
to say that we're finishing the 2x

00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,710
blockers and maybe stopping there Devon

00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:05,099
would you kind of agree with that yeah

00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:06,150
okay yeah so the question is this this

00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:08,069
kind of new stuff that we're talking

00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:09,930
about four to play is that going to

00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:13,859
potentially be a 3x branch for media and

00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:15,539
no probably not I think by the time we

00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:19,489
would get ready to do that we should be

00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:19,489
spending it on Drupal 8 at that point so

00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:25,140
you mentioned there's at least the NT

00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:27,059
browser is right now an eight projects

00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,619
project correct a lot of work to

00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:29,999
backward to seven so that would never

00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:33,150
exist the seventh version of media

00:42:29,999 --> 00:42:35,489
probably not I don't I I mean I can't

00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:37,049
predict the future I don't think any of

00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:39,150
us will be doing it but I would

00:42:37,049 --> 00:42:40,979
encourage anyone who wanted to try to

00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:44,190
backport it would be more than free to

00:42:40,979 --> 00:42:46,289
do so because it is open source and last

00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:48,150
thing is I'm just wanting was there any

00:42:46,289 --> 00:42:50,009
plans with media to including kind of

00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:52,210
rush integration

00:42:50,009 --> 00:42:54,400
what kind of dress integration would you

00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:55,390
want well one little thing and I guess

00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,089
it's probably could be done with some

00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:59,470
kind of PHP of alcohol but with what

00:42:58,089 --> 00:43:02,769
we're working on right now we actually

00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:04,809
have about 1,600 sites about half of

00:43:02,769 --> 00:43:06,609
those are integral 5 and we're trying to

00:43:04,809 --> 00:43:09,160
get them all the way to Drupal 7 using

00:43:06,609 --> 00:43:10,660
our own migration script and one thing

00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:13,150
we have to do every time the upgraded

00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:14,880
site into the media 1x branch is you

00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:19,599
have to manually go to the site and

00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:21,369
install the media types I don't know of

00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,529
any kind of rush call to actually say

00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:25,650
just figure that out for yourself and

00:43:23,529 --> 00:43:28,809
then just put it into the command line

00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:29,920
got it yeah I think I don't think that'd

00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:32,140
be something that would be managed by

00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,329
drush i could see i could first see

00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:37,329
address command to import like existing

00:43:34,329 --> 00:43:43,539
files from the file system so that could

00:43:37,329 --> 00:43:46,839
be worthwhile yeah yep thank you so with

00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:48,460
the new release cycle for core you know

00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:49,930
and I think juries might have had like

00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:52,630
the word media on there for like five

00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:54,670
seconds in like an 8.2 well I totally

00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,920
missed it if he did oh maybe maybe I'm

00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:59,440
wrong maybe okay I was a little far away

00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:02,049
but so with the difference between the

00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,970
file entity and the mediate entity you

00:44:02,049 --> 00:44:06,039
really think that those like entity

00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:08,049
browser and entity what was the other

00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:09,640
one and the embed would be the things

00:44:08,049 --> 00:44:11,380
that would get into core rather than

00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,180
those other two components for contribs

00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:15,940
that was the approach that eventually

00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:18,549
was taken I think we could easily see

00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:21,640
that approach happening there may be a

00:44:18,549 --> 00:44:24,789
larger discussion needed for what will

00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:27,460
get approved for core but yes I could

00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:30,489
see the embedding and the browsing

00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:31,749
components being added in because if we

00:44:30,489 --> 00:44:34,420
go with this approach where it works for

00:44:31,749 --> 00:44:35,829
anything you know they could use the

00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:38,739
browser component with just the native

00:44:35,829 --> 00:44:41,380
core upload field or just a view of

00:44:38,739 --> 00:44:45,700
already uploaded files so that should be

00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:48,819
possible oh yes all right any other

00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:54,190
questions at all you just all want to

00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:56,049
see a demo where is the code sprint it

00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:58,029
should be here at the conference center

00:44:56,049 --> 00:44:59,799
I'm not exactly sure of the location

00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:01,989
they have said they have a big room for

00:44:59,799 --> 00:45:03,280
us that's as much as i know so i would

00:45:01,989 --> 00:45:05,440
check the website may be closer to

00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:09,310
friday and we'll definitely tweet out of

00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:11,140
a link from either my account or the the

00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:15,900
drupal media twitter account with the

00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:15,900
location alright one more question

00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:20,980
actually it was just going to give some

00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:23,740
more info on that so the volunteers that

00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:26,230
are going to be available on friday will

00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:29,020
help you get set up with an environment

00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:30,730
if you're new to that so if you've set

00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:33,250
up d8 before you can go right to the big

00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:36,220
room find the table with these people

00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:38,080
and that'll get you started if you've

00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:41,470
never installed d8 find somebody with a

00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:43,780
gold shirt and they will help you triage

00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:48,210
to somewhere that you can get started

00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:48,210
and set up Thanks cool thank you

00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,470
so I'll just kind of briefly show what's

00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,470
possible here

00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:14,360
hey cor all right

00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:21,920
so okay I have a test note here with a

00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:24,390
picture of me snuggling my cat Rodney

00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,160
and we have a second node where we are

00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:27,299
embedding everything so let's go and

00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:34,410
edit that because we can't really see

00:46:27,299 --> 00:46:36,440
what's going on yet it's not related to

00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:36,440
me

00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:43,200
I might need a rebuild here let's just

00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,200
see

00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:58,770
hooray let's fix live code yep that's

00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,770
what happens

00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:08,740
what did I do oh I switched to know

00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:08,740
French

00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:16,060
file field for matter

00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:20,279
there we go

00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:37,000
it's fun writing plugins and drew boy

00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:38,800
code when you don't do it very often but

00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,650
it's funny because after ever since we

00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,760
have the the sprint in New York City

00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:44,349
I've actually been really excited about

00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,869
working with the embedding stuff and

00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:48,820
it's kind of been the thing that I've

00:47:46,869 --> 00:47:50,650
been kind of wanting to make sure we

00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:53,560
really get done right and working with

00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:56,950
that summer of code student alright now

00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:59,230
that we fix that local issue so we have

00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:01,690
text above the atom embedded entity I

00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:05,740
have my embedded node rendered

00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:09,300
completely with comment form and I have

00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:09,300
two small smaller embeds

00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:19,820
a file which I have used the file link

00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:22,880
with a caption and just an image with an

00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:25,130
image style with a caption so we'll see

00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,610
how that actually gets embedded here at

00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:27,610
the actual HTML

00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:42,190
and we don't have it visible in the UI

00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:42,190
fck editor yet but if we view source

00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:52,020
so really all this is being powered by

00:48:54,540 --> 00:49:01,140
want to make sure you can see this it's

00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:05,830
just one div powering an entire embed

00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:12,040
and all it has is a data entity type

00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:20,050
node which says what entity type it is I

00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:22,240
have data entity ID for node 1 and this

00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:26,740
is an advanced example here but if I did

00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:28,119
data View mode equals teaser that would

00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:30,820
render the node with the teaser me mode

00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:35,920
and that's all you need you could also

00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:39,070
enter in a uuid for the unique ID for

00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:43,480
that note internally it finds no tidy

00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:45,670
and uses the uuid itself so and by

00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,190
default it in beds using the uuid as

00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:52,869
well I just use ID because it's easier

00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:55,869
for me and if you wanted to add a

00:49:52,869 --> 00:49:57,940
caption a Drupal core provides us out of

00:49:55,869 --> 00:50:01,390
the box if you just add a data caption

00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:04,839
attribute it embeds a little caption

00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:07,750
where you can type in text and so here

00:50:04,839 --> 00:50:10,690
we have our our file link so entity type

00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:13,570
file data entity ID equals 1 and this is

00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:15,940
the end more advanced embedding syntax

00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:19,839
that uses the plug-in type so we're

00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:24,640
saying data entity embed display it's

00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:26,349
the file entity display plugin which

00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:29,130
corresponds to file field for matters

00:50:26,349 --> 00:50:32,380
and use the file default for matter

00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:33,700
which is the link to the file and we can

00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:37,050
kind of see the same thing with the

00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:40,660
image it's saying use the image plugin

00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:44,349
for an entity embed display and use the

00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:47,619
default image for matter and then a

00:50:44,349 --> 00:50:50,950
second data attribute data data entity

00:50:47,619 --> 00:50:53,200
embed settings which is a JSON encoded

00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:55,020
string of settings saying image style

00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:58,030
use medium

00:50:55,020 --> 00:51:00,640
so that's how we encompass the entity

00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:04,510
embedding and this seems to be working

00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:07,270
extremely well I should give a plug out

00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:10,180
for Jeff eatin session battle for the

00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:14,490
body field at five today he'll probably

00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:16,600
be talking it's tomorrow tomorrow okay

00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:19,300
because he will actually be referencing

00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:23,320
this as one of the solutions that he

00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:27,340
loves so anything that makes Jeff eatin

00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:29,440
happy I'm usually okay with two so so

00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:31,360
yeah that's how you embed identity

00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:34,330
there's no actual we're working on the

00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,560
UI do select and stuff but we're mostly

00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:37,780
working on this underlying data

00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:40,210
attribute solution and it seems to be

00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:45,870
working incredibly well so any questions

00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:49,070
about that at all all just amazed

00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:49,070
