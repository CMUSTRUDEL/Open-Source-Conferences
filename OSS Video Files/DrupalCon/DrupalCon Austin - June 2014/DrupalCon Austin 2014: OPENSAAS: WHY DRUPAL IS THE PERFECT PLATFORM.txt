Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: OPENSAAS: WHY DRUPAL IS THE PERFECT PLATFORM
Publication date: 2014-06-04
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: ahoppinjoshkrobertDouglasschrisyates
A new wave of startups are basing their business model on OpenSaaS-- online applications that a customer can subscribe to as a turnkey supported software as a service, or simply download, self-host, and self-support.

OpenSaaS offers customers the best of both worlds-- the innovation potential, freedom, and control of open source, plus the simplicity, quick time to deployment, and often lower up front cost of SaaS.

Wordpress.com and Wordpress.org are perhaps the best example of OpenSaaS, and, until recently, DrupalGardens.com was the only real Drupal based OpenSaaS example. In addition to We're now starting to see a number of more focused Drupal-based OpenSaaS products take flight, including the Opigno LMS (http://opigno.org), the Jobiqo recruiting platform (http://epiqo.com/en/jobiqo), and our own NuData DKAN open data platform (http://nucivic.com/products/nudata/).

We believe that Drupal is an exceptional platform for building OpenSaaS businesses. Unlike hosted versions of typical one-off open source apps, a platform such as Drupal is truly open-- not just in software license, but also in terms of the practical sustainable ability to fire your hosting vendor and take your platform to another consultant, because of the ubiquity of the Drupal developer community. And unlike many generic content management systems, Drupal today is a powerful enough framework to build and support focused web applications that deliver an exceptional end-user experience, thanks to the maturity of the platform, and the commodity availability of Drupal Platform as a Service (PaaS) from Pantheon and Acquia.

This session will outline what OpenSaaS is, our experience with building a Drupal-based OpenSaaS business, and how you can do it too. You'll also hear Josh Koenig about why OpenSaaS may in fact be a critical for the long-term competitiveness of Drupal in the face of growing competition from proprietary SaaS platforms.

the patience of the few minute delay

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,919
here we have to slide integration

00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:10,349
technical difficulties I'm Andrew hoppin

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,420
and we're going to talk today about open

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,070
SAS which is a concept that's kicking

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,199
around in this community since about two

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:20,789
thousand nine but I feel like is having

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,529
a new seeing a new dawn today in the

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,269
Drupal community and going to go into

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:25,650
why I'm personally so excited about it

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,859
they're joined up here by some

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,830
incredible thought leaders in the

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,969
community Crusades from aquia robert

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,149
douglas from commerce guys and josh

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:40,110
Koenig from pantheon very honored to be

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:44,640
in their esteemed presence so without

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:48,140
further ado I'm going to kick it off and

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:52,170
tell you why I'm so excited about this

00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,699
so open SAS I define as the best of open

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,350
source is combined with software as a

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,730
service and when I mean open source I

00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,890
don't just mean open source and licensed

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,500
in this context I mean open source in

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,120
terms of the practical ability to

00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,400
support yourself with a code base

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,290
without needing to go to any one

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,700
particular company or without needing to

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,780
pay anybody you have the technical

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,210
skills you can have a successful

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,770
experience with it in production and you

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,450
can actually contribute to it so to me

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,830
that's the definition of a true open

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,200
source collaborative really built

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,729
software project you know different than

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,439
a company building a one-off

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:27,299
purpose-built application and throwing

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:28,979
the code up on github and the other key

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,740
piece of this I think is the ability to

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,240
deploy that application in a

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,509
software-as-a-service context that means

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,540
on a commercial cloud with support

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:43,970
turnkey so that it just works and the

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:46,560
beauty of this is that when you have

00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:49,320
customers that don't want any technology

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,540
burden they can not have that and it can

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,759
still benefit from the software on the

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,960
other hand if you want a to use the

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,840
software without having any dependency

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,460
on any company or any third party you

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,170
can do that as well so it's really the

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,969
best of both worlds of open source and

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,409
software as a service and we're going to

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,649
get into I think Drupal such a great a

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,060
great platform to do this on just a

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,069
little bit of background you know way

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,080
back when we went from managing stacks

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:13,770
of servers in air-conditioned rooms to

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,240
running virtual sir

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,120
the cloud that was great great new

00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,100
efficiency then we went to being able to

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,280
actually have lamp in the cloud you know

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,230
took it up 11 major level which added a

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,340
lot of efficiency for all of us and now

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,050
we're at the level where we can actually

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,370
just focus on the application itself you

00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,230
actually just focus on creating the

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,000
business value for the customer in the

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,390
cloud and all that other stuff is really

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,560
commoditised and taken care of for us so

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,390
that's what's so awesome about SAS

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,560
obviously but I think when you combine

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,240
that with the truly open source

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,090
collaboratively built software platform

00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,620
you have something quite special and the

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,770
seminal example of this of course is

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,270
WordPress right wordpress com makes tens

00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,580
of millions of dollars if not more for a

00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,650
company automatic every year posted

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,450
turnkey it just works you just focus on

00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,610
creating and sharing your content but

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,990
we're breast org is truly open source

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,700
you can download the code base never

00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,070
talk to automatic never pay them a dime

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,930
and it also works and is really robust

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,960
and you can contribute to making the

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,910
WordPress platform better so even though

00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,980
we're here a triple con wordpress.com

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:17,820
and org I think are truly the seminal

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:20,280
example of open SAS however Therese as

00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,630
far as I know coined the term open SAS

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,800
back in two thousand nine so we

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,709
certainly in the Drupal community

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,060
deserve some credit for that as well and

00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:29,280
the akwa Koreans were talking about it

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,170
at conferences as far back as 2009 I

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,320
came to this fairly recently you know I

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:36,870
was a former government CIO in the New

00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,310
York State Senate and I was really

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,040
frustrated I really wanted to innovate

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,410
in my institution and yet I was always

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,820
torn between getting to market fast with

00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,530
the new application that we needed to

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,760
stand up which implied software as a

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,600
service for example we were looking at

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,250
Salesforce for CRM but the realization

00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,600
that I often needed to change my mind

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,700
sometimes on technical merits because

00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,900
the world's moving very fast and a

00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,370
government institution were not all is

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,830
the most nimble and able to keep up but

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,180
also because sometimes the my legal and

00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,380
technical and political requirements

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,760
would be changed by stakeholders and

00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,590
ways of rabbit out of my control so I

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,650
was really worried about having a

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,640
dependency on a third-party proprietary

00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,930
environment even if it was quick and

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,670
efficient to get up and running a

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,859
software as a service so that led me

00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,660
towards to be biased towards open source

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:20,070
but at the time was hard for me to get

00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,600
the same kind of efficiency and the same

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,250
kind of support with open source

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,870
solutions so put them together open SAS

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,280
very exciting I think particularly for

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,500
public sector where you have

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,300
these unique unique requirements so the

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,830
value proposition for customers pretty

00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,770
obvious but no technology burden and

00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,030
software-as-a-service it just works fast

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,100
time to launch you know we're not

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,230
instead of building a custom Drupal site

00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,000
after writing an RFP and selecting a

00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:45,580
vendor and maybe you get a nap product

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,690
out the door a year after you started if

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,130
it's a really product that it really

00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,440
meets your needs you can just turn it on

00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,050
for all intents and purposes freedom to

00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,030
host anywhere so cloud portable if it's

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,020
hosted in the if it's truly open you

00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,720
ought to be able to host a

00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,980
software-as-a-service in multiple places

00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,990
no vendor lock-in inherent and that of

00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,250
course as well I'm benderson ceasing to

00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,260
provide value to me I want to be able to

00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,780
switch take my application and my data

00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,820
with me to somewhere else unlimited seat

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,350
licenses typically right none of this

00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,330
you know it's fifty dollars a month per

00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,710
user because that's the business model

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,260
of the one company that provides it to

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,770
you and then of course rapid product

00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,970
innovation I mean the whole point of

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,350
open collaborative software development

00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,880
is versus open source and license I

00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,800
think is that we're aggregating the

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,990
effort and the talent and the energy and

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,700
the creativity of tens of thousands of

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,590
people into making something that

00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,780
ideally can outpace even proprietary or

00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,040
software as a service by virtue of

00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,160
aggregating that effort across the

00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,470
global community so that's on the that's

00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,140
on the customer value proposition decide

00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,970
for us as a product company and I am a

00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,560
part of an open SAS product company now

00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,870
the reason we want to do this is because

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,330
we get higher profit margins software as

00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,490
a service we can serve each additional

00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,860
customer with our open source based

00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,080
product more efficiently than we could

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,760
by building custom one-off websites for

00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,840
them and so we can get higher profit

00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,300
margins on that we can't even charge

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,740
them ellesse and be a better value for

00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,120
the customer while making more as a

00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,860
company and so that's obviously really

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,530
attractive to us makes our business more

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,539
scalable as software-as-a-service

00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:15,340
however as I went through on the slide

00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,289
about going up the stack in terms of

00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,930
what we can commoditize an outsourced in

00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:21,310
the cloud we can commoditize all the way

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,310
to the Drupal platform as a service

00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,440
layer today so all that complexity all

00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,330
that maintenance all those security

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,650
requirements that we used to have to

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,479
handle on our own if we wanted to build

00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:34,140
the software as a service company we can

00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:37,900
outsource to companies such as these

00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:41,169
three that my friends here work for to

00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,509
my right similarly we can defray the

00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:44,979
passive rd across an entire community if

00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:47,289
we play nicely in this community if we

00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:49,749
build a Drupal based product which we've

00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:52,090
done we ideally don't have to actually

00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:53,229
innovate that much ourselves because

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,969
we're part of a community that's

00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:56,409
innovating in a global scale and then

00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:58,449
we're just translating that into a form

00:06:56,409 --> 00:07:00,009
that a customer can get as software as a

00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:01,150
service which reduces our capital

00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:02,800
expenditure to keep our products

00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:05,319
innovative and add ahead of its

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,330
proprietary competition tremendous

00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:09,099
degree and why do we want to do this

00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,360
well ultimately it's kind of that in our

00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:12,310
case that we're impact junkies we want

00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,110
to help more people we started a company

00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,150
in order to make governments work better

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,039
we can only do so many of those of erbil

00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,599
doing traditional website development

00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:20,740
and consulting and we want to help

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,210
thousands of governments and we feel

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,819
like if you know if Boston figures out

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,620
why something works well it's something

00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,580
that works well deploys it we think

00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,529
Austin should be able to take advantage

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,150
of that really quickly and really

00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:33,099
affordably and without having to

00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,499
reinvent that wheel rebuy that wheel and

00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:37,509
we think an open SAS business model and

00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:40,599
service delivery model makes that

00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:42,879
possible so just really quickly and

00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:47,949
apparently Microsoft is being kind

00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:51,699
enough to update my software speaking of

00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:53,379
open SAS or not what we've done this

00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:54,610
with there's really briefly as we found

00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:56,289
a use case that we think is really big

00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,399
and important open data management we

00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:59,770
wanted to make it easier to do that with

00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:01,270
Drupal huge market so we built the

00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,029
Drupal based distribution to do that

00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,169
called Deacon competes with two leading

00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:06,669
products in the world one is a

00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:08,949
proprietary software as a service called

00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:10,330
sacré de another is a fantastic open

00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:13,120
source project called sea camp it's

00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:15,759
based on Python and we built the DK and

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,129
distribution to provide a new Drupal

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,419
based alternative to that and why we

00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:22,629
think it's powerful is because it's got

00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:25,199
the software as a service ease of like

00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:28,120
socata but it's got the open-source

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,710
goodness of sea can and we brought those

00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,509
two together and because it's based on

00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,219
Drupal because we can commoditize a lot

00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:34,539
of the hard things in terms of Drupal

00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:36,279
platform-as-a-service hosting and

00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:38,860
support we can actually bring this to

00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:40,449
market quite quickly and affordably for

00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,740
customers so that's what we're doing

00:08:40,449 --> 00:08:42,819
there's a lot of other companies out in

00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,470
the world trying to do this now with

00:08:42,819 --> 00:08:45,730
Drupal a pig nose an interesting one in

00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,040
Switzerland doing this with a learning

00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:50,470
management system and we think that

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,990
Drupal is a phenomenal community and

00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,640
platform and culture to do this within

00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,410
and

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,050
couple reasons why first of all the

00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:01,960
distributions or just rows and install

00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,940
profiles model is really powerful it

00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,430
means that we can get together not just

00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,980
at building something up the content

00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:10,090
management system layer and saying we'll

00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,250
make this a great content management

00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:14,410
system every three or four years Drupal

00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,940
7 Drupal 8 what have you but we can

00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,680
actually go up even a further layer and

00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,840
collaborate around that at scale

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,850
effectively we can say you know at a

00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,890
product level at an application that

00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,780
does something very specific for a very

00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,310
specific use case we can actually

00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,450
aggregate the effort of hundreds or

00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,400
thousands or maybe even tens of

00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:32,500
thousands of Engineers because the

00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,030
technical model for distros and the

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,590
governance around that around that on

00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,990
drupal.org really lends itself to that

00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,580
so we built and they are lead maintainer

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,650
zondi can but we have contributions to

00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,990
it from engineers all over the world

00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,640
that never have to talk to us never pay

00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,640
us a dime but they're contributing to

00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:51,520
the project not all open source CMS

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,750
projects had that and similarly the

00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,370
scale of the contributor community

00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,590
Drupal is are so big that we can

00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,540
actually outpace much better resourced

00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:00,820
companies working on their proprietary

00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,470
products that do similar things because

00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,930
of the scale and our culture of not

00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:08,260
charging people for controls and for

00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:11,410
themes in the Drupal community so lots

00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:13,060
of focused web apps have yusuke's also

00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,070
that need content management systems so

00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,330
for a long time people didn't do open

00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,160
data with Drupal because they thought

00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:21,160
it's a special thing it's a datastore

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,870
it's api's and so they did it with other

00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,610
purpose built applications like c-can

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,580
which is all well and good but a lot of

00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:29,200
the sites that launched with the ckn

00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,400
platform as an open data store realized

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,630
they really needed a content management

00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,940
system as part of that they needed to

00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:36,070
manage user roles and permissions and

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,720
content in the context of data and

00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,730
taxonomy xand all these things that

00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,340
Drupal does so well and so we think that

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:44,170
having a CMS be the basis for products

00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,430
is a really good place to start because

00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,690
even if you're not thinking that it's

00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,280
content management that you want to do

00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,890
you need all that other stuff that

00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,740
Drupal has made so robust and really

00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:57,250
click together admin UI accessible in

00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:59,530
many many cases so in the other thing is

00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,060
that there's so many people innovating

00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:03,310
at the platform as a service level again

00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:06,370
most notably I think these three

00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:07,390
companies on my right that we are going

00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,259
to be able to stay out ahead of the

00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,729
curve not only with our

00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:11,499
product we think but also in terms of

00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:13,660
the ability to have it delivered to a

00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:16,389
very large scale delivered very securely

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,679
and what have you so we're just really

00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:19,929
grateful and fortunate to be doing this

00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,429
with Drupal for these reasons maybe a

00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:23,379
little small and hard to see so I'll

00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:25,689
invite you to check it out online later

00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:27,429
but this is just a visual representation

00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:29,350
of all the things that we found we don't

00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:30,759
have to do because we're doing this with

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,779
Drupal and because we're doing it

00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:33,939
partnership with Drupal

00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:35,529
platform-as-a-service hosting companies

00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:37,179
we really are just focusing on the

00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:39,339
things that we know best which is how to

00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:41,109
provide business value around things

00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:43,179
that we really know intimately open data

00:11:41,109 --> 00:11:45,279
for government and everything else we're

00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:46,929
able to really outsource to partners

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,389
because we know how to do this in the

00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:51,519
context of Drupal legally

00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:52,749
technologically and culturally so with

00:11:51,519 --> 00:12:02,729
that I'd like to turn it over to to

00:11:52,749 --> 00:12:05,619
Chris Yates Christopher mock me up I

00:12:02,729 --> 00:12:08,079
want to build on the point in Anders

00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:13,059
last slide which is focus on on what you

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:14,289
know and back in I think 2012 I was

00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:15,970
talking with Barry jaspin who was

00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:18,369
principal is the principal architect

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,169
Avantia cloud and he was talking about

00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:22,329
his his vision for that he had when he

00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:25,059
when we started building that product I

00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:27,939
think back in 2009 it was really that

00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:31,119
people could create their own businesses

00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:33,009
their own SAS based on these tools and

00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:34,539
that we were providing to them and he

00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:36,369
picked that something that he figured

00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:38,619
was like super nit shoes he said well

00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:40,419
you know I could you know we can enable

00:12:38,619 --> 00:12:42,819
a company that serviced dentist's office

00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:45,279
they created office you know websites

00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:47,319
for dentists and practices i Jes and

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,519
whatever and that was like the most

00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:51,009
niche thing you could think is kind of

00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:53,470
have a kind of a joke internally and I

00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:56,259
actually expanded on that idea and you

00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:58,059
know presented that as as an idea around

00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:01,359
the same topic to NATO AWS made up that

00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:02,709
year talking about how you know Drupal

00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:04,389
is the ideal platform for building those

00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:05,979
types of services because it's

00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:08,499
incredibly malleable it's a correct

00:13:05,979 --> 00:13:11,379
incredibly incredibly extensible and

00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:13,029
then we've got to the point where we've

00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:15,759
been able to abstract so many of the

00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:19,010
layers that sit below it and are a

00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:22,950
burden to a company trying to build

00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:24,690
so taking away the layers of network

00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,070
management and buying servers and

00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,840
managing their uptime and all of those

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:31,680
types of things you know you can

00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,330
purchase a subscription now what's key

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,100
to being able to build a business on top

00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:37,800
of that is one having having something

00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,680
great that you can go out and sell as a

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,960
value proposition to your customers

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,080
being able to maintain that long-term so

00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:48,480
you know making it a turn key service

00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:51,770
and being able to be really agile with

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:55,230
how you how you actually deploy that so

00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:57,480
being able to use api's and really

00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:59,670
simple tools to create new sites and

00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,830
update masses of sites and network

00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,480
content between them and drive new

00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,680
features so that you're increasing value

00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,390
year over year because that's that's

00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,970
what with SAS you have to earn the

00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:10,890
customers business every year so it was

00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,090
kind of a you know a lark we thought

00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,500
this would be an example hopefully it's

00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,210
inspirational it's a little bit funny we

00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,370
had this kind of concept which probably

00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:19,800
depends on you know whether you live in

00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:21,000
the States and grew up in a certain time

00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,470
period whether you understand what the

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,700
good dentist versus bad with dentist

00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,470
references are and these little slides

00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:29,070
that would probably like super fine

00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:31,950
print up there but then last year it

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:34,860
happened so you know a company called

00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:37,800
Heartland dental has a business serving

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:40,620
dental practices individual dentists

00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:43,560
orthodontists and they are building

00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:46,260
thousands of sites on on Drupal and on

00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,620
you know past platforms and SAS services

00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:53,190
that's it behind it so they're using

00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:56,010
subaqueous cloud services but they're

00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:57,330
delaying at you know in a way that

00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,920
allows them to create things really

00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,480
quickly so instead of being at having a

00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,670
technology bottleneck and a human

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,190
bottleneck to be able to spin up a new

00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:07,590
site and sometimes taking weeks to get a

00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,030
single dental office ons online you know

00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,320
they can just click a button and then

00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:12,960
start customizing that for the

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,930
particular dentist really quickly they

00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:18,450
have this copy I dia the ability to do

00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:20,400
updates both at the you know the feature

00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:23,640
and function layer so what we would do

00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,350
with you know updating the distro but

00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,630
also at the content layers so being able

00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,280
to say you know this office sells

00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,030
Invisalign in this office doesn't and

00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,830
being able to update you know certain

00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:36,790
products and product offerings in mass

00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:38,320
across your sites as well so it's

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,990
letting them get to market a lot faster

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,940
and increase their margins so there be

00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,440
there not you know they don't want to be

00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,360
a technology company they want to be a

00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,250
company that provides a unique service

00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,640
and this is one of those services in the

00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:54,100
portfolio they offer and I see this kind

00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,830
of breaking down into two three three

00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,780
categories of where companies can kind

00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:01,450
of enable this this ecosystem so to make

00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:03,520
more Heartland dentals and Heartland is

00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:06,070
an example of a company that's actually

00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,240
created a business that's externally

00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:09,700
focused they're going out there

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,400
marketing this product they're servicing

00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,660
this product there you know continuing

00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,450
to drive their innovation and their

00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,130
value but we have lots of customers and

00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,750
users in the Drupal community are doing

00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:21,940
this internally so you know to the

00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:24,790
largest farmers or the largest farm of

00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:29,410
the world is doing this internally they

00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:31,930
have SAS platforms to deliver campaign

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:36,340
and product websites at the same speed

00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:38,200
and agility NBCUniversal is doing this

00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:41,230
internally with a distribution called

00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:45,750
publisher seven that they deploy out in

00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:48,070
aqueous cloud so there are you know

00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,570
opportunities to engage in a couple of

00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:53,460
different levels for companies that want

00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:55,840
to be part of this ecosystem so aqua and

00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:58,780
an Theon and commerce guys have built

00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:01,000
platform as a service as some of the

00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:03,610
foundational elements so the ability to

00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,070
develop and deploy rapidly be able to

00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,210
kind of abstract those lower layers of

00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:10,090
the stack we showed at the very

00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:11,740
beginning not worry about servers and

00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:13,180
uptime and those types of things push

00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,930
that on to somebody else and some other

00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:19,480
systems there's a great opportunity for

00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:22,120
companies that you know a market no

00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,130
space to start building platforms so

00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,830
take distros and actually start

00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:29,190
delivering them as true products and

00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:32,950
continuing to deliver additional value

00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:35,380
for their end customers and then there's

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:36,910
option the opportunity to build things

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,800
at the engagement layer the top of the

00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:40,570
stack so plugging in things like

00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,150
marketing automation and the expertise

00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,680
that that's around that

00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:46,900
targeting and those types of things so

00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,480
pure SAS services that can complement

00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,670
the distro and the SAS and the past that

00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,550
sits below it and then the real key to

00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:56,320
being able to mechanize this whole thing

00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,960
is making sure that all of these things

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,650
are available through AP is so that you

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,780
can build you know custom tool sets and

00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:06,550
you know it administrative portals those

00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,110
types of things that are really suited

00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,640
to your specific workflow whether you

00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:12,130
know you have to send sites through an

00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,600
FDA regulation process or you have to

00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:16,360
send sites through you know marketing

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,340
review or whatever it is being able to

00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,560
effectively build tools around the tools

00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,940
that you're using it's a different sort

00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,300
of business though so it is you know

00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:28,030
higher margin potentially but it is a

00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,380
different type of business than pure

00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:32,530
services so it's not enough just to

00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:36,430
build the distro you know it requires an

00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:39,340
ongoing commitment to continue to you

00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:41,410
know add features and functionality you

00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:44,050
know keep everything that that comprises

00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:46,150
that that distribution and the business

00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:48,370
model up to date and then you know go

00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:51,010
out and and market and service it as

00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:53,590
well so you have to deliver that in an

00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:55,810
ongoing basis like I said there are you

00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,940
know opportunities for lots of different

00:18:55,810 --> 00:19:00,520
types of companies to be involved past

00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:03,190
providers and SAS providers and the

00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,440
vertical experts to focus on on what you

00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:11,500
know whether it's you know dentists or

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:15,870
its NGOs or it's it's what have you so

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,870
with that over to

00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:30,300
Thank You sand hi everybody my name is

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,150
robert douglas from commerce guys and a

00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:35,040
quick question how many of you build and

00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:38,850
deliver sites for clients out of

00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,770
curiosity okay how many of you would

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:49,830
consider that you sell a product of some

00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:51,720
sort okay good so back to the definition

00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:54,660
of sass when when when you talk about

00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,310
software as a service you're talking

00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,050
about software that you don't download

00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:01,320
and install but rather software that's

00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:03,360
delivered over the web and there are a

00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,030
couple of observations in that when you

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,540
talk about Drupal then that could either

00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:11,610
be a website that you build yourself and

00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,860
you maintain the website and people come

00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:16,260
and get whatever services is from the

00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:18,360
website so it could be a single website

00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,250
and all your customers go to one website

00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,680
and that would be what we'd call a

00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:26,310
multi-tenant software as a service model

00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:29,700
or it could be that you provide them a

00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:31,110
website of their own and that's the

00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,600
software that they're getting delivered

00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:35,130
as a service and that would be what I'm

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,890
going to refer to as a single-tenant

00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:39,840
model of software as a service so and I

00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:43,200
think the differentiation there is quite

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,810
fundamental to any organized thinking on

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,720
the topic so I bring it up right right

00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:50,070
away and it's also worth mentioning

00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,980
since we're inspecting software as a

00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:55,050
service that commerce guys aqua Pantheon

00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,540
all had to go through the process of

00:20:55,050 --> 00:21:00,420
building a software-as-a-service website

00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:02,670
when we launched our products and we

00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,680
took massively different approaches I've

00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:06,180
got tiny bits of insight into Pantheon

00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:11,130
and quite a bit of insight into the

00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:12,690
Acquia and commerce guys so it's it's

00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,400
quite interesting space and there's a

00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,950
lot of variety and there are no clear

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,270
rules so I'd like to talk about one

00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,430
specific model that I think is

00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:23,370
particularly interesting to a really

00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:25,140
wide number of people in the room who

00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:27,180
raised your hands when you said that you

00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,770
build websites and deliver them to

00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:31,890
clients and that's the sing

00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:33,750
tennant model where your goal is to

00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:36,450
provide somebody with a website that's

00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,190
their very own website and the reason I

00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,900
think that's particularly interesting

00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:42,110
for Drupal is because Drupal strength

00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:45,030
lies in its ability to be customized

00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:47,160
everybody likes Drupal because it can

00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:48,720
fulfill any wish that you have you just

00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,650
have to customize it the right way and

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,810
it becomes what you want it to be the

00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:57,210
limitation of a multi-tenant software as

00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:59,460
a service model where all your customers

00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:01,530
come to web one website is that it makes

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,410
it massively hard to provide that

00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:06,810
customized that customization therefore

00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:09,510
you're missing out on the unique selling

00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:11,040
value of Drupal to begin with so I'm

00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:13,560
going to focus on the single tenant

00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:18,300
model the single tenant model in its

00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:22,140
entirety is very abstractly and very

00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:23,700
naively represented on my slide now it's

00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,790
worth mentioning that I've been going

00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:28,680
around the world speaking at conferences

00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:33,180
admonishing people to build Drupal based

00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:35,040
products for quite a long time now so

00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:37,170
I've probably spoken about how you

00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,900
should be product izing your Drupal

00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:41,910
distribution concentrating your know how

00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,370
your domain of interest into a

00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:46,110
distribution and product izing it but

00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,910
what I didn't realize until I actually

00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:50,040
moved to commerce guys and went through

00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:52,380
first the process of launching my own

00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,730
software as a service site and then

00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,320
seeing some of the stuff that my

00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:57,090
colleagues at Commerce guys were working

00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,580
on is that there's a part that's missing

00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:01,380
in the thinking from that lots of people

00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,390
build distributions how many of you

00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,430
built the distribution before install

00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:07,530
profile distribution right it's a good

00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:09,330
way to encapsulate the things that you

00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:11,310
know and do over and over and over again

00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:14,700
how many of you use distributions

00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:18,000
Panthea a panoply kickstart demo

00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:21,180
framework okay there are lots of them

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,450
they're very useful how many of you sell

00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:26,940
distributions to your customers Wow

00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,410
awesome that's great do you have a

00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,010
direct sales model where they use a

00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:33,350
credit card to check out on the website

00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:37,880
raise your hand

00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:39,470
bingo missing link so in my previously

00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,140
on ieave and expanding view of

00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:44,750
software-as-a-service an actual software

00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:47,090
as a service business at least a

00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:49,850
self-serve one starts with a website and

00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:51,770
that you see that on the left-hand side

00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,720
of the screen where it says my product

00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:56,360
calm and it has little credit card logos

00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:59,000
that's where your customer goes to buy

00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,130
their software as a service product okay

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,530
that's your website that's a stand-alone

00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:05,179
website and that it mirrors the model

00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:06,740
that these three companies have followed

00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:08,480
in their software as a service product

00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:13,240
and then what happens after that is

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:16,070
magic it goes triggers some actions and

00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,470
creates hopefully based on a

00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:20,870
distribution or starting point a website

00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:24,500
for your customer that has let's say a

00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:26,840
drupal distribution in it and that comes

00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:29,539
from on the right hand side the product

00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,130
code repo so that's where you're going

00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:33,350
to want to work on your product do your

00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:35,900
product development product maintenance

00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:39,080
and that's the source from which updates

00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:41,000
and upgrades flow from but now remember

00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,330
we want to retain that flexibility and

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,280
customizability the Drupal depends on

00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:48,530
that's why I have little blue boxes on

00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:51,940
each one of those websites where it says

00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:54,880
customer one customer to and customer 30

00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:56,900
well you've made my next one's red I

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,059
apologize for making Robert slides look

00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:06,980
awful okay he turned all my Venn

00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:09,230
diagrams red be did it so to make that

00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,909
work you actually need three things okay

00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:13,039
I'm going to leave the Drupal

00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:14,809
distribution aspect to your imagination

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,580
because you're probably experts on that

00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:18,169
if you've ever built the same sort of

00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,150
website two or three times already

00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:22,100
you're probably ready to go and make

00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:24,140
that distribution right now imagine

00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,400
that's in that code repository in the

00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,159
upper right-hand corner where you do

00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,720
your product development now on the left

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,850
hand side of the Venn diagram here is

00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,100
something called commerce licensing and

00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:36,500
I'm here to tell you that there are open

00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,390
source tools that handle the recurring

00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,370
billing the usage-based billing the

00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,260
metered billing the prorated billing the

00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:44,210
plan based billing that you would want

00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,950
to do if you have a

00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,149
software-as-a-service model now if you

00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,950
think about the different models

00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:52,369
out there there are lots of them let's

00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:54,229
take a flicker where it's like one size

00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:57,889
fits all you pay 35 bucks a month and

00:25:54,229 --> 00:25:59,960
you get everything or let's take AWS

00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,969
Amazon Web Services is another software

00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,799
as a service model there you don't pay

00:26:01,969 --> 00:26:05,479
until you use anything and they've got a

00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:08,029
hundred and fifty different products you

00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:09,710
can use at different sizes and they

00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:11,779
charge you for how much you use in the

00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:13,249
month and if you use it for five minutes

00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:14,450
they charge you five minutes worth and

00:26:13,249 --> 00:26:16,580
if you don't use anything they don't

00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:18,919
charge you anything etc etc to

00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:21,019
completely diametric models all of which

00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:22,879
can be modeled with commerce license

00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:24,979
billing and then finally at the bottom

00:26:22,879 --> 00:26:27,379
layer represented by the gentleman at

00:26:24,979 --> 00:26:29,779
this table you need a Drupal specific

00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:34,039
hosting platform that can do a number of

00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:35,690
things so I'm going to talk about that

00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:37,969
right now the things that you want your

00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,749
Drupal specific hosting platform to do

00:26:37,969 --> 00:26:40,190
if you're going to build a

00:26:38,749 --> 00:26:42,710
software-as-a-service model like I just

00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:45,769
demonstrated are you need to be able to

00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:48,169
launch a distribution okay it's no good

00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:49,879
if you have to check in the code for

00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:51,830
your distribution at the gate command

00:26:49,879 --> 00:26:53,359
line when you launch the site you need

00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,979
to be able to actually build the site

00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:57,820
from the distribution to start with

00:26:54,979 --> 00:27:01,429
drush make files or dot profile files

00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:03,440
are the best methods for doing that

00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:05,839
because it relies on underlying tools

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,779
that you already know like drush so look

00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:11,269
for that when you look for your hosting

00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:14,029
platform furthermore you want to be able

00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:16,580
to separate the code that's coming from

00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:17,719
the upstream repository from the code

00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:20,269
that you're actually going to do the

00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:21,139
customization with why let's say you're

00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:23,119
doing restaurant sites

00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:25,580
software-as-a-service restaurant signs

00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:28,460
up they get their website they go and

00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:30,409
they make their menu and put the map in

00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,369
their contact details the next thing

00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:33,200
they're going to want to do is they're

00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:34,969
going to want to theme their site you're

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,249
not going to want them messing around

00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:38,570
with the upstream code distribution

00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:40,820
because that's the part that you

00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:42,799
maintain that's your product if they get

00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,889
their hands on that not only do you have

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:49,190
no more IP that you then you have to

00:27:45,889 --> 00:27:50,619
release everything as the GPL and they

00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:53,509
can bring your server to its knees by

00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:55,519
stupidity so you don't want that so you

00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:57,440
want a way to segregate the code that

00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:59,200
they can edit and run in their

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,480
repositories from the code that

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,240
provide and smush the two together in a

00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,649
way that's safe for everybody to run and

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,200
finally you want it to be cheap enough

00:28:05,649 --> 00:28:10,840
to spin up a new site one at a time so

00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,510
that you've got a suitably low entry to

00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,830
the market for your customers so that

00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:16,750
you're not priced out of the market by

00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:18,760
your hosting company so those are your

00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:21,490
evaluation points on choosing hosting

00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:23,470
company now in terms of commerce license

00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:25,330
I'm not going to go into this slide in

00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:29,860
detail you can look it up at drupal.org

00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:36,010
project commerce license com not calm

00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:37,450
what a habit that is dot de so the model

00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:39,190
of that is that you can basically put a

00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,990
license on anything I could put a

00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:42,760
license on access to the website I could

00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:44,679
put a license on downloading a file I

00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:48,070
could put a license on a user role and

00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:51,220
then I can charge with the card on file

00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:53,559
with the commerce license billing I

00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:55,630
could charge any of the payment plans

00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:57,279
that you can imagine for your sass you

00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:58,840
know whether it's a package based

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,370
payment plan whether it's a metered

00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,960
payment plan where they need to do

00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:03,549
prorating or not that's the difference

00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,860
if you like built everybody on the first

00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:08,260
of the month or bill everybody 30 days

00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,490
after they start right so like if I bill

00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,659
everybody on the first of the month and

00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:12,429
you start on the fifteenth of the month

00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:14,409
what are they owe me half a month you

00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:16,480
know how do you figure that out that

00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:18,279
software which is available on that link

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,690
can help you with all of that and you

00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:22,299
can make any business model you want

00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:24,639
it's kind of like wreaker Lee only in

00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:25,690
Drupal and you've got the software in

00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:29,919
your hands and you don't have to pay to

00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:34,000
use it and then that's you know then you

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:36,940
sell licenses to those products so right

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,669
there are a couple other fine details

00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:41,860
and running a software-as-a-service one

00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:44,049
of them is that you need to do invoicing

00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:46,690
so anytime you do commerce of any kind

00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:48,100
you need to do invoicing so look at the

00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:50,740
Billy module that's what commerce guys

00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:53,080
uses you also need to do what's called

00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,789
dunning management that's when a credit

00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,320
card goes delinquent you need to start

00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:58,690
pestering the people that they need to

00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,460
pay you with either hard declines where

00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:03,010
the card was stolen they changed the

00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,600
number or soft declines where they just

00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,649
didn't have enough balance or they're

00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,200
behind on their payments but they've

00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:10,059
caught up so now they can pay you all of

00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,610
that is in this world of commerce of

00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:13,090
license billing and you can find lots of

00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,490
links

00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:18,400
online if you just follow the first one

00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:23,140
that i gave you can i have two more

00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:26,050
minutes yes I want to briefly branch out

00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:28,030
into how Drupal 8 is going to help with

00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,560
Drupal or with software as a service in

00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:32,050
Drupal there are three major reasons

00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,550
Drupal 8 s godsend for these models the

00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:35,410
first is configuration management

00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:37,690
configuration management is going to

00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:40,150
give you up sell possibilities in terms

00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:42,880
of packaged features that you can just

00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:45,820
tick a box on your provisioning website

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,290
and have the cmi configuration put into

00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,090
the customers site in a way that

00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:50,440
activates a feature you can put a

00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,030
license on that configuration with

00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,820
commerce license billing and when they

00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:58,090
don't pay for it goes away with REST API

00:30:54,820 --> 00:31:01,120
is in Drupal 8 you can actually monetize

00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:02,650
or you can do all sorts of things like

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,690
you could monetize your api's you could

00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:07,990
build apps that help your customers

00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:09,670
manage their products just suffice to

00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:12,310
say that Drupal 8 is going to have

00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:13,960
superior REST API s and Twitter wouldn't

00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:15,820
have ever grown to what it is if it had

00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,100
just been a website so stop thinking

00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,350
about building websites and build api's

00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,660
first build the website around that

00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:25,450
that's my advice there and finally most

00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:27,550
importantly twig twig in Drupal 8 is a

00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:29,620
game changer for that separation of the

00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:31,120
code you maintain versus the code that

00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,760
you'd let your customers get their hands

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,620
on now I was around when they built

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,790
Drupal gardens and if they had had twig

00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,520
back then they would have done it

00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:40,600
totally differently because right now in

00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,240
Drupal gardens as far as I know you

00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:46,240
can't go in and edit any template files

00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,980
because they're in PHP you'd hack all of

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,080
the other customers with the PHP and

00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,270
bring the servers to its knees but with

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,090
twig you could actually let the customer

00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:57,010
go in and change the theme files like

00:31:55,090 --> 00:32:00,130
they really want to and not have to do

00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:02,170
browser-based theming and deploy it

00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:03,970
without bringing the server in any

00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,830
danger at all so your software as a

00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:07,810
service model is going to heavily depend

00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:09,670
on twig for that restaurant that wants

00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:11,350
their own look and feel you can just

00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,370
give them the twig files let them do

00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:14,650
whatever they want they can't break a

00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:16,860
thing and with that I'll hand it over to

00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:16,860
Josh

00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:28,790
alright i'm rounding home so i'm going

00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:31,130
to speak to contextually why this

00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:34,280
matters for the universe this is the

00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:37,429
software CMS market this is website

00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:39,559
technology none runs most of the

00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:41,360
internet it's not being run by any

00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:43,400
wordpress drupal or other content

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,200
management system who here develops

00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:48,230
websites for living is like a website

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,910
developer PHP person I asked before you

00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,410
came to Drupal how many of you put your

00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:56,179
hands up had written your own content

00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:58,100
management system in Java not none runs

00:32:56,179 --> 00:32:59,690
most of the internet like we don't have

00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,010
most of the world developers coming to

00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,450
Drupal cons most of the world's

00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:04,669
developers are still banging it out

00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:07,370
reinventing the wheel and for

00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:09,200
open-source to really achieve its

00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:10,549
destiny which I believe Drupal's

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,110
Destiny's run a double-digit percentage

00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:14,179
of the internet and I think in toto all

00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:16,429
open source content management systems

00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:18,820
should exceed fifty percent perhaps even

00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:20,960
approaching eighty percent of websites

00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,600
we're not going to get there if we're

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,100
building every website from scratch

00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,960
certainly not starting with blank slate

00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,669
and writing your own user forgot their

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,500
password system but also not if you're

00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:32,929
just installing Drupal vanilla and

00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,270
building it up from there it's too much

00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:36,919
work it takes too much time and it

00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,870
requires people to make too many choices

00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:41,870
that they fundamentally don't really

00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:45,010
have the time or expertise to make the

00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:47,540
role for us as experts is to marry our

00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:48,650
technical expertise with our domain

00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,330
knowledge that all these guys have

00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,820
talked about and I have analogy that I

00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:55,190
like to use when describing this inside

00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:57,350
of Drupal we see our tools as this like

00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:59,000
powerful building block system you know

00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,590
it's like Legos you can just lump things

00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,120
together one piece on top of the other

00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:04,010
and you build amazing and beautiful

00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,740
things the problem is that for the

00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:08,149
uninitiated for most of the universe the

00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,399
experience of attempting to pick up a

00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:12,740
new scruple is closer to this it's a

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,409
giant mess you're stepping on things

00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:18,020
that hurt your feet and it doesn't work

00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:20,570
for a well if Lego incorporated sold

00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:22,879
only a giant plastic sack full of a

00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:23,750
bunch of Legos in the toy store that

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,399
would be out of business tomorrow

00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,560
because no one would choose that as

00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:28,970
their first time experience now after we

00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,669
have ten LEGO sets and you've got them

00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:31,079
all in the plastic

00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:32,429
don't mount to play with that's what you

00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:34,440
and that's what you're doing but but

00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:38,369
that's not where you start you start

00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:41,669
with something like this right there's a

00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:43,649
description of the product it comes in a

00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:45,690
box there's a reasonable expectation

00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:47,730
that everything you need to construct

00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:49,679
the thing in the picture is in the box

00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:51,960
and there are instructions on how to do

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,879
so there's an even a label on the blocks

00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,710
that gives you an idea of who it's for

00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:57,270
this is not for teenagers it's for

00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:59,849
little kids so I know if this is right

00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:01,559
for my audience being able to this is

00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:03,839
what we this is the concept of product

00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:06,720
ization writing it or quit it involves

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:09,359
us as technical and domain expertise

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,040
experts making decisions for other

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:13,109
people and it's very different than the

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,579
consulting model where by and large

00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:15,960
you're looking listening to what other

00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:18,630
people are desiring and figuring out

00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,150
whether it's possible to do but I would

00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:22,890
really suggest that more of you probably

00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:24,809
have more expertise than you think about

00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:26,970
what your customers need like if you

00:35:24,809 --> 00:35:28,920
serve as particular type of market you

00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:30,780
know the dentist market is a good one or

00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,490
i know someone who's done this for four

00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,530
lawyers right once you've built the

00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:36,450
fifth lawyer website you have more

00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:38,250
expertise on what lawyers need for

00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:40,140
websites that any lawyer because you've

00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:42,030
seen across five different organizations

00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:44,609
what's worked what hasn't how they're

00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:47,190
working and you can marry that domain

00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:49,109
expertise on their type of business with

00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:50,849
your technical expertise on how to build

00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:52,950
an illiterate amazing website and for

00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:55,020
the sixth lawyer suddenly there's not

00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:57,150
this long discovery process because you

00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:59,490
already have all the answers and there

00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:00,869
might even be some cases like oh I would

00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,549
have never thought of that but you're so

00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:04,020
right i totally need that feature or i

00:36:02,549 --> 00:36:05,160
thought i needed this other feature but

00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,540
you know what it never came up and

00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,130
that's what i mean by bringing together

00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,680
the expertise to make it happen we need

00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:13,650
to figure out how to turn at a product

00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:15,510
level something that is purely a pile of

00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:17,280
legos into something that comes in a box

00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,809
and people want to pick up and use and i

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,180
believe this is possibly because i got

00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:23,430
involved in drupal by doing this my

00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,660
experience was working on a presidential

00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:27,359
campaign trying to take over the

00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:29,160
government as I say and having that fail

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,069
but taking the expertise that we use

00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,859
their and driving a very rapidly growing

00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:38,609
campaign and turning it into a general

00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:40,230
purpose product for nonprofits this is

00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:41,849
before Drupal head installation profiles

00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:43,360
this is before a lot of things exist is

00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:47,050
very early days for Drupal to

00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:48,130
for 2005 but you know it was amazing to

00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:49,750
see what would happen when you took

00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:51,520
Drupal you made it so that on

00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:53,410
installation it had a bunch of content

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,330
and configuration already in it that

00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:57,100
made it like a cause based website and

00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:59,410
you put up a website explaining what it

00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,940
was in that language to that audience

00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:02,320
and you went out and talked to them and

00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:04,270
said hey I've got this great solution

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,890
for you and at the time nonprofits were

00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:08,680
married to these like terrible

00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:10,570
proprietary sass monstrosities they were

00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,280
like leftover relics of the 90s that

00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:14,080
weren't being updated and were just they

00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,010
kind of they had all their caller data

00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,630
in there and they were just sort of

00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:18,730
squeezing them honestly what's he was a

00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:20,680
bad and we went and broke that open with

00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:22,240
open source and civic space and only

00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,040
later on today realized they actually

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,170
had Drupal and then they would try to

00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,760
hire a drupal developer to extend their

00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:29,530
platform it was kind of fun and at the

00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,320
time we never had we didn't have the

00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:34,540
automation technology necessary to

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,850
deliver civic space as a service it was

00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:38,230
just a product eyes tarball that you

00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:41,470
have to download kind of like how open

00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:43,290
atrium was but the future is now in

00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:45,460
terms of how we're doing this I mean I'm

00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:47,140
building this stuff every day and it

00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:49,420
works it totally works and we can make

00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:51,820
it even better than it is now so I would

00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:53,860
say if anybody is thinking about this or

00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:56,290
has dreams of doing this start thinking

00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:57,940
about what your Lego boxes and start

00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:59,740
thinking about you know who might be

00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,390
willing to pay how much for it how you

00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:03,760
would service it whether you want that

00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:04,990
type of long-term commitment and and

00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,850
start investigating the potential

00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:09,760
because we have all the pieces we need

00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:17,380
to put together open source software as

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:18,850
a service open sass nobody open sass and

00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,320
and being illiterate and that's what

00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:21,760
it's going to take for us to get to that

00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,340
broad reach of the mark and that's I'm

00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,440
terribly excited to be an enabling force

00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:27,730
in that equation because I really do

00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,440
believe that the Internet itself will

00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:33,870
get much much better as we're able to

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,870
drive none out of business zoo thanks

00:38:37,059 --> 00:38:44,569
that okay so I want to give one shout

00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:49,490
out one point of disambiguation and then

00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:51,980
ask a question to each of y'all and then

00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:53,450
open it up shout out is that we've never

00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,829
be able to do what we're doing today

00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:56,359
with our new data software service

00:38:54,829 --> 00:38:58,609
without the kinds of platform of service

00:38:56,359 --> 00:39:00,650
that these folks have are investing and

00:38:58,609 --> 00:39:01,849
making so we're very grateful as a very

00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:05,299
small company that we can do very big

00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:07,420
things thanks to that Drupal platform as

00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:09,759
a service is just an amazing amazing

00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:12,230
efficiency gaining thing for us

00:39:09,759 --> 00:39:17,180
disambiguation I'm talking about open

00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:18,920
SAS as something where some customers of

00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,990
ours subscribe to our software as a

00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,940
service it's turnkey for them but others

00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:24,349
in the world never talk to us and never

00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,970
pay us and are essentially getting the

00:39:24,349 --> 00:39:28,220
same thing it's just they're doing more

00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:29,569
work to self support in self rely and

00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:31,279
that ability to go back and forth

00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:33,890
between a software-as-a-service context

00:39:31,279 --> 00:39:35,569
or a self-service context using the

00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:37,700
open-source underlying distribution is

00:39:35,569 --> 00:39:40,099
really what's key in terms of our value

00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:41,809
proposition to our customers and the

00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:43,700
lack of vendor lock-in that we offer two

00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:45,440
in particular public sector customers we

00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,970
were paying for the stuff with tax

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,650
dollars in the first place so that's

00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,819
what I mean by open SAS and I think it's

00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:52,279
worth pointing out that i think what

00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:53,930
robert is speaking about more with your

00:39:52,279 --> 00:39:55,670
charging people with with credit cards

00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:58,940
for a service that they sign up for and

00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:00,279
subscribe to online may not have that

00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:02,690
same dynamic it mates

00:40:00,279 --> 00:40:04,460
software-as-a-service that's easy easy

00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:06,349
to build and maintain and affordable and

00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:08,240
powerful for the company because it's

00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:10,210
built on open source tools and those

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,349
open source tools are themselves

00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:14,119
affordable and robust because they're

00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:15,799
contributed to by a number of developers

00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:17,539
all around the world but there's not

00:40:15,799 --> 00:40:18,740
necessarily the same context of the

00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:21,799
person paying with a credit card this

00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:23,599
month is then going to go download the

00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:26,119
same code that they're getting in the

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,950
service context and self support so a

00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:29,299
subtle point but i think it's it's

00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:30,859
really interesting that there's so much

00:40:29,299 --> 00:40:33,769
that we could talk about in the universe

00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:36,259
of open SAS and in the universe of how

00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:38,660
to do that well with Drupal so that's my

00:40:36,259 --> 00:40:40,309
point of disambiguation questions and

00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:43,130
going to ask you to get a little

00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:44,420
commercial and competitive here and i

00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,829
can do that because i'm not in the

00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,310
drupal platform the service business but

00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:50,340
like to ask each of you

00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:52,470
about your you know your your company's

00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,670
best product offering for people drupal

00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:55,950
developers considering building software

00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:57,030
service based on drupal and why it's

00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:58,140
awesome you know what to say bad things

00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:00,450
about others but why yours is

00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,800
particularly awesome so Chris your site

00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:04,620
factory product you mind just giving us

00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,690
a minute on why you think that's an

00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:09,630
awesome offering for software as a

00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:12,120
service and open SAS sure site factory

00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:13,860
is closer than yeah select factory is a

00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,710
product that that came out of our

00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:18,660
original open SAS in some ways which was

00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:21,150
Drupal gardens dribble gardens was a

00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:22,830
tool that was very much in the vein of

00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:24,450
what what Robert was talking about where

00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:25,980
you go with your credit card you sign up

00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:27,450
for a year and you build you know your

00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,760
individual website and it was a

00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:32,340
general-purpose thing what site factory

00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,440
is enable us to do is to allow you know

00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:37,020
folks like Heartland and folks like you

00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:39,450
know water music and other large

00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:41,700
enterprises to go take you know a

00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:43,470
specific distribution not not a

00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,090
general-purpose one that's you know

00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:46,650
supposed to meet you know every sin

00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:48,180
every conceivable use case even though

00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:51,270
it is quite malleable you know

00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:53,370
everything you know from you know your

00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:56,040
your dentist site to your insurance or

00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:58,020
broker site to your soccer team's

00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,150
website can be built in a Drupal garden

00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:01,530
sort of way it allows site factory

00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,880
allows you to be much more specific in

00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:04,440
terms of the use cases you're going

00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,760
after because it allows you to plug your

00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,860
own distro into it and it gives you all

00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,410
of the tools to actually manage the

00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:13,230
updates across a really large network of

00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:14,730
sites so out to potentially you know and

00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,710
most of our customer implementations

00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:18,540
thousands of sites you know in the

00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:23,730
underlying technology runs you know tens

00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:25,950
of thousands of sites and our wider SAS

00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:29,100
product and all these things intersect

00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:31,230
with some of the engagement layer

00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:33,020
services that were also rolling out so

00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:36,030
it's it's also important to note that

00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:38,760
it's great to have a platform to you

00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:40,500
know create and run the site but there's

00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,510
a lot of added value that you can give

00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:45,420
to customers on top of that by you know

00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:47,250
in through instrumentation or products

00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,620
like aqua tail lift that give you tools

00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:50,700
for adaptive personalization user

00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:53,790
management and those types of things

00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:56,310
awesome Robert a new kid on the block

00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:59,960
platform sh

00:42:56,310 --> 00:43:02,910
that's right awesome it's awesome

00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:05,310
particularly in this context because to

00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:09,450
build it like I mentioned we first built

00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:12,000
a SAS site you know the our platform SH

00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:13,950
site with all the credit card taking

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,040
details and the site launching details

00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:19,140
and we coupled that with you know system

00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,090
where you sign up for and it launches as

00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:23,010
a you know a platform as a service it

00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:27,020
launches a cluster for you where you can

00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:31,020
develop a Drupal site and it's only a

00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:33,450
slight twist on that story that makes

00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:35,970
what we've built actually a business in

00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:39,030
a box for somebody who wants to make a

00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:41,340
distribution based software as a service

00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:44,520
business so if you have a distribution

00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:46,620
that you want to launch as a

00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,540
software-as-a-service all those parts

00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:52,260
that you're not supposed to worry about

00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:54,270
the payment taking the invoicing the

00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:57,210
dunning management and of course the

00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:59,160
hosting can be provided by this business

00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:00,930
in a box because you'd use the same

00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:04,200
infrastructure that we use to take

00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:05,490
payments and manage the customer

00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,770
relationships so you've got the

00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:10,500
monetization model built directly into

00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:12,900
it and instead of launching a platform

00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:15,780
as a service cluster you actually launch

00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,940
a website for your end customer but it

00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:20,610
retains the platform of a sort as a

00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:22,770
service flexibility so in the case of

00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:25,620
restaurant site they can hand they can

00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:27,830
hire like a an agency or their cousin to

00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:30,630
come in and actually work on the theme

00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:32,160
maybe customize it a little bit so it

00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:34,410
retains the best of both worlds it

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,420
retains the link to the upstream code

00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:38,880
repository where you're maintaining your

00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,560
distribution that they can't touch but

00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,780
it gives them a space where they can add

00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,490
modules at themes at libraries to

00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:47,880
customize it the way that they want to

00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:49,260
and they just see the customer just sees

00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,820
that they've got their own website they

00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,010
can hire an agency that come talk to us

00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:54,750
they get access to repo and then they

00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:56,640
can do that and it's nicely encapsulated

00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:59,250
nicely isolated and you've got

00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:03,140
everything you need to build a business

00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:03,140
around your distribution in one place

00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:09,670
pantheon one to rule them all uh 11

00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:12,880
dashboard to rule them all

00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:16,390
alright uh so what's good about our tech

00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:19,660
for this market is our infrastructure

00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:21,849
model is different and we don't need to

00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:25,480
launch servers or clusters to support

00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:27,160
new customers we have a highly agile

00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,720
infrastructure that we've got other

00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,770
talks at rubicon on but the the

00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,510
important thing is that we're able to

00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:34,000
create partitioning and isolation

00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:35,530
between sites between environments for

00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,910
sites so if you want to a staging in a

00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:38,980
development environment for a site and

00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:42,119
not just work in live we encourage that

00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:46,799
and and this this enables you to build

00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:48,579
highly efficient a site network style

00:45:46,799 --> 00:45:50,799
architectures without having to deal

00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:52,660
with multi-site it allows you to cleanly

00:45:50,799 --> 00:45:55,210
integrate changes that come from your

00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:56,650
upstream as robert douglas explained as

00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:58,720
well as changes that are specific to a

00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:00,790
site whether those those are things that

00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,559
you're doing as an extra value added

00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:04,329
service to a customer or whether you're

00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:06,040
enabling the customer to use pin the

00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:09,400
Pantheon dashboard or tool set or just

00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:12,510
get repository directly themselves and I

00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:17,290
think that we have a the ability to

00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:20,500
deliver stability for large site

00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:22,299
networks in a way that is is somewhat

00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,579
unique because we were able to isolate

00:46:22,299 --> 00:46:26,400
and partition each site without creating

00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:29,140
a bunch of busy work for anyone to do

00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,250
you can have one site get really big

00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:31,690
without having to worry about what's

00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:33,220
going to happen to the other sites you

00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:34,780
could have one site be attacked by

00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:36,130
Russian hackers without having to worry

00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:38,650
about what happens to the other sites

00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:39,970
you could have one site decided to

00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:42,040
become once to become very very

00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:43,180
customized along a certain line without

00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,770
having to worry about how that will

00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:48,099
impact the other sites and I think that

00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:50,589
flexibility and agility is key as we're

00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:52,359
in the next say three to five years as

00:46:50,589 --> 00:46:53,799
we are figuring out exactly what the

00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:56,140
right models are and what the right

00:46:53,799 --> 00:47:00,280
products are in the world of open sass

00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:02,079
and into Andrews point we would make it

00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,839
our assistant would make it relatively

00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:07,359
easy for you to do sort of the best of

00:47:04,839 --> 00:47:09,010
both worlds where you could have turnkey

00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:11,170
you know getting it from company X

00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:12,910
that's you the site provider this thing

00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:14,500
directly on pantheon and you're kind of

00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:15,609
managing all of that and they're just

00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,920
getting the website at the end of the

00:47:15,609 --> 00:47:19,270
day or you could also say but if you

00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,730
want to do it yourself here you can

00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:23,109
launch it on Pantheon and have a SAS ish

00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:26,499
experience but you're in

00:47:23,109 --> 00:47:28,749
control of the of the development of the

00:47:26,499 --> 00:47:29,980
site I'm ability to offer hybrid models

00:47:28,749 --> 00:47:33,339
like that is something i think we bring

00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:35,499
to the table can we all agree everybody

00:47:33,339 --> 00:47:40,299
at the table that drupal multi-site can

00:47:35,499 --> 00:47:43,029
die in burn in hell no no no no you

00:47:40,299 --> 00:47:45,369
cannot agree on that john pugh is

00:47:43,029 --> 00:47:48,249
moderating a discussion on the

00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:51,789
multi-site question oh really okay the

00:47:48,249 --> 00:47:57,789
debate the great multi-site debate yeah

00:47:51,789 --> 00:48:01,660
yeah so it's okay 1045 Tamar do we know

00:47:57,789 --> 00:48:03,130
what room is 8a bathroom 8a if you want

00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,960
to see some like developers throw down

00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:07,239
on the merits and cons of multi-site and

00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,999
other gloves really come off yeah it's

00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:12,279
AB off its like off not off the record

00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:15,579
so we've got 10 minutes for questions

00:48:12,279 --> 00:48:17,829
but while we get that cued up please

00:48:15,579 --> 00:48:20,470
please please go to austin 2014

00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:21,279
drupal.org / schedule and say that we're

00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:22,839
awesome because that's the only reason

00:48:21,279 --> 00:48:24,960
we get to do this and might if we're

00:48:22,839 --> 00:48:27,670
lucky get to do it at a future drupalcon

00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,559
meantime left open up the floor to

00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:32,920
questions and john feel free to lead ask

00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:34,960
a leading and provocative question do

00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:38,440
you about multi-site I don't have no

00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:43,569
opinion on that I'm an impartial

00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:44,619
moderator so I'm involved in the ager

00:48:43,569 --> 00:48:47,440
project and so something I'm very

00:48:44,619 --> 00:48:50,920
interested in is the possibility of open

00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:53,170
paths and the the idea of how we all

00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,690
have these software tools like chef and

00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:59,619
puppet and etc to have our configuration

00:48:55,690 --> 00:49:01,930
and servers as actual software the

00:48:59,619 --> 00:49:03,999
concept of open sourcing that is very

00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:05,859
very appealing to me and I know everyone

00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:08,170
a lot of people are doing this now and

00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:09,309
with independent you know repose and

00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:11,230
vagrant tools and all sorts of stuff

00:49:09,309 --> 00:49:14,529
like that so I guess I'm just curious

00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:16,480
how like what you your companies are

00:49:14,529 --> 00:49:18,759
thinking about that and how we might be

00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,650
able to kind of open up some of these

00:49:18,759 --> 00:49:23,079
things because so much of what you have

00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:24,789
is basically standard open configuration

00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:27,099
things you know like whether it's

00:49:24,789 --> 00:49:29,289
varnish or certain configurations like I

00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:31,690
feel like your business models are

00:49:29,289 --> 00:49:34,509
amazing and I've ton of respect for you

00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:35,930
bad but the the value is really coming

00:49:34,509 --> 00:49:37,520
from like you know yours

00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:39,140
sauce or whatever makes you unique you

00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,210
know I mean so I feel like I'm just

00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:42,650
curious what if any thoughts are where

00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:45,320
are you guys companies might be going in

00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:49,250
terms of maybe like releasing more or at

00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:51,560
least opening up how it how you know you

00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:54,110
can have a good standard more standard

00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:58,580
or at least less chaotic suggested

00:49:54,110 --> 00:50:01,160
configuration for Drupal so I'll take my

00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:03,860
answer that question yeah so most of

00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:08,210
what we we do is open source and we're

00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:10,760
actively trying to get less secret sauce

00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:13,070
and we look at secret sauce as it comes

00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,600
in two flavors we're ninety-nine percent

00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:17,120
of your secret sauce is actually like

00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:19,070
rotten vinegar and it's not so much the

00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,660
secret sauce that drives a fitness is

00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:22,310
business as it is the technical debt

00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:24,500
because you had to hack up some solution

00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:26,810
to get your your stuff to work at a

00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,980
certain point in time and one percent of

00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:29,450
your secret sauce is actually something

00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,370
that you figure out this very unique and

00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:32,330
you've got a particular insight around

00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:34,910
and that's kind of what you're building

00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:36,200
your business on and in our case we've

00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:39,110
already pushed most of the stuff that

00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:41,210
lets us do our platform work upstream

00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:42,740
into systemd and that's going to be on

00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:44,900
every blue new server and every rail

00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:46,520
server so it's kind of cool that our

00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:48,290
codes going to run on a lot of servers

00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,940
that don't having to do with Drupal so

00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:52,040
look at the core of all the stuff that

00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:53,450
we did low level that makes what we did

00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,040
possible it's already open source and

00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,570
that's intentional on our part like

00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,270
where we're actively looking to get more

00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:02,450
of our container solution built on that

00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:04,460
out of our custom thing and use

00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:06,080
something more commodity like a like an

00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:09,020
open shift or a docker we're not sure

00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:10,820
yet but it's when we do that it's less

00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:12,920
us throwing our stuff over the wall and

00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:14,660
more working with upstream because we

00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,880
want to make sure really for us the

00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:18,440
value is that we don't not that it's

00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,030
nice to open source things but if you

00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:21,860
like I don't not a fan of companies that

00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:23,360
just throw code over the wall like

00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:25,580
really what you want is you want to work

00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,780
with an upstream broader community so

00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:28,310
that you get something that's supported

00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:29,750
and that has value to us as a business

00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:31,880
too because then it means we can stop

00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:34,070
supporting things internally like any

00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,960
all your all your poison secret sauce is

00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:37,250
work that you have to do every six

00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,860
months or every three months to keep

00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:41,270
keep going and then beyond that like the

00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:43,280
the real value that we bring it's all

00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:45,710
just orchestration and you've already

00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:49,130
cloned like ninety-nine percent of what

00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:50,690
we do so and the truth is it's it's not

00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:52,099
we could there's code that could be

00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,450
released but it's actually you could

00:51:52,099 --> 00:51:55,519
just like use the product for an

00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:58,700
afternoon and figure it out but it's not

00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:00,259
really it's not really I don't feel like

00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,910
there's and people have different

00:52:00,259 --> 00:52:03,500
opinions about the particulars of how

00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:05,269
they want to do that so I don't know how

00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:07,579
much value there is and saying we

00:52:05,269 --> 00:52:09,019
synchronize database by using my sequel

00:52:07,579 --> 00:52:10,430
dump and then loading it into the other

00:52:09,019 --> 00:52:12,710
database like that's what anyone would

00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:16,250
do like do I need to open source my gist

00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:18,380
I don't know so so some of the stuff is

00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:19,819
is a my answer is there's a little bit

00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:22,039
of stuff that will always keep you know

00:52:19,819 --> 00:52:23,029
to ourselves there's a lot of stuff that

00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:25,609
we're actually trying to push out

00:52:23,029 --> 00:52:26,720
upstream as an intentional act and then

00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:29,539
there's other stuff that kind of seems

00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:31,880
too obvious to figure out how or why we

00:52:29,539 --> 00:52:35,000
would open source it you covered it

00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:37,579
perfect for me yeah the only other thing

00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,529
I'd add is that there are other aspects

00:52:37,579 --> 00:52:41,539
of what we're doing that we're also

00:52:39,529 --> 00:52:43,609
trying to push hard on getting back into

00:52:41,539 --> 00:52:46,069
various open source communities so it

00:52:43,609 --> 00:52:48,980
might not be you know the core of how we

00:52:46,069 --> 00:52:50,650
orchestrate you know servers and sites

00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:53,329
on servers and those types of things but

00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:55,309
there's a lot of value that you know

00:52:53,329 --> 00:52:57,259
companies that are managing tools like

00:52:55,309 --> 00:52:58,490
this whether it's a sore pass can

00:52:57,259 --> 00:53:00,349
contribute back to all the stuff that

00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:01,849
this these things are built on top of so

00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:04,569
whether it's contributing back to

00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:06,259
tungsten or to STATS tea or graphite

00:53:04,569 --> 00:53:08,269
trying to move other open source

00:53:06,259 --> 00:53:14,900
projects for at the same time it's

00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:18,650
important yeah other questions oh come

00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:20,509
on really all right let me ask you guys

00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:23,859
a question who in the audience actually

00:53:20,509 --> 00:53:29,359
wants to run a product based business

00:53:23,859 --> 00:53:30,529
okay Bravo um who like of those people

00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,940
who showed their hands how many people

00:53:30,529 --> 00:53:35,750
are thinking that's like an automated

00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:38,150
subscription-based thing okay

00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:39,500
interesting okay yeah I'm just curious

00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:40,849
like what people are thinking in terms

00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,950
of how they want to be able to leverage

00:53:40,849 --> 00:53:45,680
this stuff because you know we're in the

00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:46,819
room for a reason and I think that

00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,799
reason is that we're interested in

00:53:46,819 --> 00:53:51,380
exploring alternative ways of delivering

00:53:48,799 --> 00:53:55,480
service to people and making us and them

00:53:51,380 --> 00:54:02,950
happier at greater scale so

00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:04,869
I have so interestingly enough so the

00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:06,910
question was what vertical to serve

00:54:04,869 --> 00:54:09,900
dreese was asked that question on reddit

00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:13,750
during ama ask me anything and he said

00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:17,980
he identified sess as the highest margin

00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:20,560
biggest opportunity model to go into as

00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:23,830
opposed to customized hosting or digital

00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:26,260
agency and he in particular thought that

00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:28,720
ecommerce and marketing tools were the

00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:31,030
hot spots and since that so completely

00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:34,930
conformed with my view of the world then

00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:36,580
I stole his AMA as the beginning of my

00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:40,420
larger presentation which you just saw

00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:46,000
the 10 minute version of I would just

00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:47,920
add one there's a tendency when thinking

00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,020
about this to think try to think too big

00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,880
I think that actually going more niche

00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:54,550
like having been a consumer of many

00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,990
marketing marketing SAS tools over the

00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:58,359
past few years I can tell you that most

00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:59,380
of them suck and it's because they're

00:54:58,359 --> 00:55:01,900
trying to be all things to all people

00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:04,000
and that I think there's an incredible

00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:05,650
opportunity as more and more marketing

00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,170
moves to the internet and people need to

00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:11,470
be smarter and smarter about it to say I

00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:13,570
know not how to do all internet

00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:15,070
marketing but rather I have a good idea

00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:17,200
of how to do internet marketing in a

00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:19,210
specific context for a certain audience

00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,350
for a certain type of product so if

00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:21,970
that's something where you feel like you

00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:24,730
have expertise that's probably a solid

00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:26,290
gold it's about audiences yeah it's

00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:28,180
really about an audience I would think

00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:30,640
of it who do you know whose problems do

00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:32,619
you understand very well and as long as

00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,390
they are have a budget to address those

00:55:32,619 --> 00:55:35,980
problems that's potentially a good

00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:37,450
vertical and I would look for not the

00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:39,460
biggest market but where you think your

00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:41,230
expertise is the deepest you see people

00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:43,780
doing things like building linkedin for

00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:46,060
doctors and having great success so what

00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:47,740
group of people do you know really well

00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:50,080
that you can build for and what are they

00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:55,510
missing in specialized tools that's a

00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:57,850
good way to do the analysis hi I'm

00:55:55,510 --> 00:56:00,340
Sheldon up to my work with Andrew but I

00:55:57,850 --> 00:56:02,170
seen since I see some of you guys here

00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:04,060
who I've encountered in the past to a

00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:06,550
really smart I thought I'd like to ask

00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:08,080
questions and if answer or one question

00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:09,570
if Andrew wants answered to that's fine

00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:12,580
but

00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:15,600
the weather you guys are ones that I'm

00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:19,230
can and I just occurs to me that the

00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:23,350
idea of selling software as a service is

00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:25,180
kind of probably the hottest new idea in

00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:26,380
terms of ways of product izing Drupal

00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:28,990
but there have been a number of other

00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:30,700
efforts for example the Drupal app straw

00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:34,330
that people are trying to embed into

00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:36,880
distros and some others and I'm and I

00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:38,740
know that I remember hearing Robert talk

00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,840
a little bit about that and challenges

00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:43,210
with that if I drupalcamp once and I'm

00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:45,640
wondering are there lessons from other

00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:48,520
attempts to productize Drupal both good

00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:49,570
and bad that you think we should think

00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:54,940
about as we think about how to

00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:56,680
productize sass and open sass so since

00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:59,260
since you attended that session whenever

00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:00,730
long ago thank you what I've learned

00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:04,600
since then is that the missing element

00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:06,820
has always been payment models and you

00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:09,750
know the the business model behind it so

00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:11,980
nobody has actually taken the dive too

00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:15,940
well very few people have taken the dive

00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:17,890
to actually charge at money to access an

00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:20,230
installation of a distribution online

00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:22,180
for example it seems really obvious but

00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:24,850
I don't think that the toolset has

00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:27,520
supported it so the you know it's just

00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:28,840
been hard and if you know how to build a

00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,030
Drupal distribution you don't

00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:33,400
necessarily know how to make it an

00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:34,840
online product that's why I'm really

00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,300
excited about the commerce license

00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:40,590
building modules that you can get the

00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:43,720
other thing that that we found is that

00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:44,830
building a pure SAS where you're you

00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,870
know you're you're trying to attract

00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:49,240
people to come to a website and then buy

00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:51,130
you no access to that site or access to

00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,660
that service with a credit card and you

00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:55,570
know not engage with them personally

00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:57,730
it's really hard you know that it takes

00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:59,650
a lot of resources so we've we put a lot

00:57:57,730 --> 00:58:01,000
of resources behind it with with Drupal

00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:02,680
Gardens over the years because that was

00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,500
the focus at the beginning was going out

00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:08,170
and engaging individuals and very small

00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:10,600
organizations so I think you know where

00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:12,690
we've seen more success commercially is

00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:14,890
where we've been able to cultivate

00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:17,710
deeper relationships with a customer

00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:18,910
based around really strong expertise you

00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:20,740
know whether it's it's companies like

00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:21,730
Andrews or its companies like Heartland

00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:23,980
dental

00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:25,990
they already have a business plan in

00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:28,690
mind and they can they have a plan for

00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:30,250
attacking a deeper relationship with

00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:31,990
more of kind of a you know an outside

00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:33,730
sales model so we're actually you know

00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:35,380
people are interfacing with people so

00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:37,180
we're not you know they're not going out

00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:39,369
people dentist aren't going on heartland

00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,660
dental and swiping a credit card you

00:58:39,369 --> 00:58:43,270
know that's part of a comprehensive

00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:45,369
service and that's gaining a lot of

00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:47,530
traction and you know these are the

00:58:45,369 --> 00:58:49,150
types of services that we can we can

00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:51,130
support now and these are when you look

00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:53,020
at talked about you know finding a

00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:55,450
finding a market finding a vertical or a

00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:57,280
niche you know those are the types of

00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:59,830
relationships you can create you don't

00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:01,930
have to to set yourself up for being the

00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:04,690
