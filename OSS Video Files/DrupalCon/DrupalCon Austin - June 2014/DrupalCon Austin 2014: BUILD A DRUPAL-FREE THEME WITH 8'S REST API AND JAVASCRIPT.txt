Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: BUILD A DRUPAL-FREE THEME WITH 8'S REST API AND JAVASCRIPT
Publication date: 2014-06-04
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: rcaracaus
Could the future of the Drupal theme layer be using RESTful Web Services and external Javascript frameworks instead of a sometimes bloated core theming system?

REST has made its way into core in Drupal 8 and it is now easier than ever to POST, PUT, DELETE, and simply GET data from Drupal. Pretty much everything in Drupal 8 is an entity and thus follows a similar exportable format. With Javascript, data from REST API's can be manipulated into clean and flexible templates free from the divitis that Morten talks about. Using this approach also draws a bolder line between the display layer and business logic, allowing Drupal to focus on being CMS, not a DMS (Display Management System).

This session will give a basic introduction to REST and Angular.JS then walk through the still experimental steps of creating the tenants of a basic Drupal theme using these technologies. This will include using Drupal 8 core modules to expose API's and the basic usage of Angular.JS and a few of its plugins to work with and massage data into a basic Drupal theme structure on an external site.

We will look at some of the quick wins this way of theming gives us but also examine some of the things that still need to be done to make this process a worthy contender to the existing Drupal theming methodology.

*This session will include recorded screencasts to avoid the common mishaps of live coding.

you might need a block TPL to start

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,180
adding some classes around the block or

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,670
take some markup away you might need to

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,960
use TPL I might need a views row TPL

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,549
node feel and it gets ya pretty

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,100
repetitive if you want to make that mini

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,830
markup changes usually we just say screw

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,750
it and leave the divs because it's

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,949
faster and the client doesn't look at

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:28,189
the ball sometimes they do and they

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:33,469
don't like it wouldn't it be nice if

00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:38,100
whoa wouldn't it be nice if we could

00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:41,520
write lien markup and CSS that actually

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:46,200
reflected display rather than just a

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:49,100
bunch of Trooper drupal logic and you

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:53,460
know maybe use some more semantic HTML 5

00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:57,390
elements I don't know just have oh there

00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:00,750
we go nice just have some markup that's

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:04,830
cleaner you know and then kind of put

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:07,020
our data in later and not necessarily

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,950
base it around what template file we're

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:14,549
using or yeah or maybe even in the

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:17,400
future when like web components come out

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:20,310
you could have more semantic classes

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,600
your own custom classes say you know you

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,549
wanted to put a recipe you could just

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,549
say recipe it makes a lot more sense of

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:32,610
an article or div or whatever element

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:37,619
we're forced to use now you can kind of

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:43,490
do that stuff now kind of but angular

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:43,490
kind of gives us a way for us to woah

00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:46,829
that's cool that's my slides this is

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,149
cool

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:53,670
reveal j/s kind of lets you have all

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,880
your stuff here anyway I don't eat my

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,770
notes yeah angular basically lets you

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,799
kind of do some of this stuff now if you

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:05,189
want to go and create some of this lean

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:09,929
markup and stuff angular is just

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:12,110
basically a file that you include in

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:14,750
your in your

00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:20,120
in your project it's a it's a JavaScript

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:24,500
library JavaScript framework that will

00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:29,270
let you do some some I mean it's like an

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:33,560
application it's kind of like a let's

00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:35,960
use kind of extends HTML let's use new

00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,610
tags and stuff to do kind of application

00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,480
logic and stuff but we're not going to

00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:42,800
we're not going to look at add a lot of

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,770
that what we're going to do is look at

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,370
some of the the ability for it to to

00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:54,530
take data and put it into a template on

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:57,860
the client side so we can't just take

00:02:54,530 --> 00:03:00,800
data from Drupal as it is like we can't

00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:07,820
go to some node page or some Drupal

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:09,650
theme and take data and and with its

00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:12,230
with it already being marked up with

00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,240
tags around it and just put it into a

00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:18,110
site we'd we need raw data angular

00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:21,910
doesn't really like you know decorated

00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:26,570
data so how do we get raw data out of

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:28,340
Drupal that's where what web services

00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:32,150
come in now when I first heard of web

00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:37,850
services a couple years ago services

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:40,519
mobbed module Drupal 7 yeah with app

00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,720
developers phone app developers I didn't

00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:47,900
really think I would ever use it as a

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:49,310
theme ER but um you can what is a web

00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,489
service and we can get into some long

00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:57,500
definitions but basically a web service

00:03:52,489 --> 00:04:01,310
is a URL that you expose on your website

00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:04,160
and you expose some raw data or an

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,630
endpoint you can think of and you go to

00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,220
it and there's no there's no markup or

00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:10,959
anything all there is is some data

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,959
that's output

00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:20,479
what about rest so Web Services and rest

00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:22,430
rest you could go to this link it's Roy

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,319
fielding

00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,180
dissertation on rest you could read that

00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:31,099
and get really confused like I did or

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:32,300
you can just think of rest as an

00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:34,400
architectural pattern

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,659
I had a philosophy but I chose something

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,599
in this slides and he's in that's an

00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:39,949
architectural pattern okay that's the

00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:41,659
kind of conversations that happen around

00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:45,139
rest people are still arguing this is

00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:47,210
restful this isn't restful yeah it's

00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:50,300
basically a philosophy dictating or

00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:53,569
architectural powder suggesting ways

00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:56,419
that we can better interact with those

00:04:53,569 --> 00:05:00,770
endpoints that data that's being exposed

00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:04,069
via reps web services there's a link

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:07,759
here to Lin Clark and Klaus E's

00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:10,490
presentation from Drupal con Prague and

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:14,419
Europe and they do a really good job

00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:15,680
talking up extending on on what a little

00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:18,620
bit when I'm gonna be talking about of

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:23,810
how to get data out of Drupal using rest

00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:26,210
in Drupal 8 this is a Drupal 7

00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,639
distribution called We the People this

00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,259
is the kind of this kind of got me gave

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,110
me my fried to do a presentation at

00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:34,879
Drupal gov in Australia that's run by

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:38,210
the way that's where my companies from

00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:40,190
and I did it on We the People I

00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,379
downloaded the petitions distribution

00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,849
and they have an API like out-of-the-box

00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:45,500
I was amazed you download it and you

00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:50,029
have all these endpoints and stuff that

00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:55,699
you can access some some petitions and

00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:59,810
some Drupal information Drupal 8 has an

00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:03,440
API out of the box as well so you

00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:05,409
install some of these modules or enable

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,310
some of these modules already in core

00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:13,159
and and that's these four up here and

00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:14,960
yeah you have an API of the box we could

00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:17,270
go into if you go look at that

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,839
presentation by Len Clark and classy

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,190
they really go into a lot of this stuff

00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,500
I'm not going to go super into it but

00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:27,199
just quickly how is hypertext

00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,080
application language it makes maybe our

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,759
output are our data that we're

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,270
outputting via our web services more

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,139
rich

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,220
HTTP basic authentication just add some

00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:40,590
authentication around getting that data

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:44,069
out so we can start having permission

00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:46,830
and different levels of authentication

00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:49,650
yeah restful Web Services adds a kind of

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:52,590
arrest framework around exposing that

00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:56,699
data and serialization is taking the

00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:59,039
Drupal data and serializing and turning

00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,289
into a format that we can extract and

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,110
there's different formats XML JSON and

00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:06,720
actually the Drupal data that we the one

00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:09,150
that Drupal 8 uses a format kind of by

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,789
default is like how Plus JSON so it's a

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,840
form of JSON called how JSON and we'll

00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:16,259
use that later just so you're familiar

00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,240
um don't worry too much if you not so if

00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:20,759
you don't understand I didn't and this

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,830
rest UI you need this contra it's a

00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,860
contract module you download it install

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:27,449
and Drupal a and like you can see all

00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,099
the rest stuff and I'll show you in just

00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:32,520
a second and this rest blocks is

00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:34,620
actually a module that I made and if I

00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,940
can do it well actually it was it was

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,830
actually quite tough I had to get help

00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:44,070
but yeah we'll talk about it towards the

00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:50,370
end it's a contrib module or a custom

00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:53,940
module yeah so configuring Drupal 8 rest

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:55,919
how do we get well first off I don't

00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,020
know if any you know and Reese's keynote

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:03,650
yesterday he talked about how a lot of

00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:07,139
the data in Drupal 8 is more structured

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:09,090
in Drupal in Drupal 7 it was a big deal

00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:11,159
like nodes were entities now and and

00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:13,229
taxonomy terms are kind of entities but

00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:16,080
like in Drupal 8 this is more so where a

00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:19,020
lot of this data is extended from entity

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,500
class and it's all kind of done in the

00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:24,360
same way it's all config there's

00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,280
conflict entities and there's content

00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,610
entities in there extended in the same

00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:33,659
way so it's easier to kind of like

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:35,310
provide a service that hooks into all of

00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:43,110
these entities in a similar way and

00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:45,329
therefore exposing these these entities

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,170
so if we go down to the rest you are the

00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:48,120
one I was talking about

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,930
you enable that and here here's the rest

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,399
UI all of these entities are kind of

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:57,260
you're able and some of them might look

00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:59,790
familiar field comment you're able to

00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:02,399
extract all of this stuff out of Drupal

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:05,940
and this is in core by default which is

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,260
really cool and you can you know use for

00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,350
that data and we're going to use it to

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,790
build a theme but the one that's enabled

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,649
by it wasn't enabled by default before

00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,899
but recently I reinstalled it and this

00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:17,699
is enabled by default now is the node

00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:20,370
entity that's like the most common thing

00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:22,380
in Drupal you know the node and the way

00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,149
you can kind of configure this you want

00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,670
to turn like all right so there's get

00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:29,310
post delete these are all actions you

00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,870
can take for our purposes for feening

00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:34,649
purposes right you know we're gonna

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:36,510
we're gonna just use get we want to get

00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:38,820
information out of Drupal you know to

00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:41,459
kind of integrate it with our clean

00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,320
markup and we'll have you we're gonna

00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:45,660
and this is by defaults already enabled

00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,579
how jae-sung enable that and we're gonna

00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:51,709
have we want to enable cookie

00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:55,199
authentication basically that just says

00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:56,699
allows an anonymous anonymous user to we

00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:01,199
read the cookie of anonymous user and

00:09:56,699 --> 00:10:04,890
allow them to access the data so back to

00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:06,660
that's coming later back to our side so

00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,399
we configured Drupal a we've enabled

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:12,510
it's enabled by default a node is

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:15,089
enabled by by default so how are we

00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:17,100
gonna get this data out like start

00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:20,390
seeing some of this data start seeing

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,680
some of this data come out of Drupal

00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:25,550
this is a really good app it's called

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:29,310
postman it's a chrome Chrome extension

00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,630
and you download it just like any Chrome

00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,990
extension and it kind of looks like this

00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,880
so yeah I have this Drupal site it's

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:40,350
called this is local right now it's got

00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:43,279
at this URL and we're going to go to

00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:48,510
node 1 and we're gonna extract the data

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:51,540
and you say get oh here we go send this

00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:54,779
is why I'm pointing mines my face at the

00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,610
screen so I can see and you get all this

00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:59,020
data you can't if you've ever done a

00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:01,810
print are like a DSM and

00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:04,630
and Drupal like you know this kind of

00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:07,150
looks like PHP output a data bits JSON

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,620
and you take these little variables and

00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,810
you route you can wrap markup around

00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,550
them it's kind of the gist of it but in

00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,590
order to get this data out what you got

00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:18,460
to do and this is confusing at first is

00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:20,740
you need to have an accept header Ferg

00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:23,530
forget forget requests and you want to

00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,240
say it's format you want to specify

00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:27,580
which format you want to get this data

00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,110
out the reason we're doing this you

00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,760
might say well why can't you just get it

00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:39,340
the reason you can't do that because if

00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:41,440
you go to node one one yeah like this is

00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:46,180
this is a recipe site obviously there's

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:49,090
some tacos and yeah node one is HTML SIA

00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:54,250
or plain text HTML and if you were to

00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:55,420
get that and in postman and I'm not

00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,800
gonna get rid of it now but if you were

00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,680
to get it it would just give you HTML

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,620
down down here so we need to specify

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,500
that we want to get JSON our Hal JSON

00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:09,100
which provides these links how specifies

00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:17,650
some of these links here ok let's keep

00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:20,350
going so when I did this I wanted to do

00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:23,290
it with different URLs so I when I get

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:25,270
this data out of Drupal you can do it

00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,990
from if you do it if you get the data

00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:28,180
out of Drupal

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:32,170
on the current site that you're on then

00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:33,700
it doesn't matter you don't need to do

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,500
anything special but if you want to get

00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,470
some of this data from a different URL

00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,480
and travel across URLs you need to and

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:43,240
do this things call and you know you

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,860
have to enable cores basically the gist

00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,750
of it is you you put this little piece

00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,490
of code on the top of your website or in

00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,560
a module somewhere and there's actually

00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,750
a cores module in Drupal 7 and

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,170
previous/next some of the guys that work

00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:58,120
with that we kind of just we made a

00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:03,700
Drupal 8 version of it and you just

00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:07,060
enable it sort of psr-4 broke it you

00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:12,340
just you just enable it and you

00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:18,220
and you can now access make requests

00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:20,410
through separate URLs so if so what are

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:24,700
we going to do here we have our Drupal 8

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:27,340
server which is basically this our

00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:30,850
little recipe site right we have a

00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:33,490
Drupal 8 server and we have some

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:35,950
endpoints so we've already enabled like

00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:38,140
node an end point where we can extract

00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:43,890
nodes out and we saw through postman

00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:43,890
that we can extract that data out and we

00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,920
we're going to enable there's another

00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,540
way if you want it you can also enable

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,190
views as well so we're gonna have a use

00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,740
endpoint that we're going to enable and

00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:56,980
then we're gonna have a kind of whole

00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,330
separate client side beam so our theme

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,250
is not going to be usually when we have

00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,530
a theme it's inside of Drupal right and

00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,510
it's running through PHP and stuff but

00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,940
what I want to do is have a client-side

00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,620
theme that sits outside of Drupal on a

00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:12,820
separate URL that's why we're having

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:15,250
cores we enable cores and that has just

00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,500
for purposes of demonstrating like the

00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,330
basic tenants of a Drupal theme we want

00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,180
to have a node detail page it's really

00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:23,890
common in Drupal a Drupal theme and and

00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,740
just a home page with like a views

00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:28,990
listing on it and the reason I put other

00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,330
you know this endpoint foo or whatever

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,430
you can have any it doesn't you're not

00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:35,110
limited to one pulling from one data

00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:38,260
source when you have a client-side theme

00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:40,090
you can have multiple you know you could

00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,860
pull from multiple Drupal endpoints and

00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:43,860
display different data on one page

00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:58,170
you can hear next door okay so angular

00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:00,600
directives now angers of angular was

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:02,910
built for designers in the beginning but

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,250
since then it's morphed into more of a

00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:07,259
it's a development tool so it's it's a

00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:13,410
little bit complicated it's pretty

00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:16,199
complicated but I'm gonna try to explain

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:17,610
it in this in the scope is the basic

00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:22,709
stuff that we're gonna use in this

00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:25,680
session so when you have a client-side

00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:27,240
theme the difference is is you know you

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,670
only need a couple files you don't need

00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,620
to setup a lamp stack you don't need you

00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:33,120
don't need map you don't need to down

00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,670
even download Drupal as long as those

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,720
endpoints are enabled you can do start

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:43,649
doing some theming with three files or

00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,449
two files the index.html file and you

00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:46,560
have to include angular just just like

00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:48,149
you would have to include jQuery

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,730
something if you're gonna use jQuery and

00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:52,889
an app Jess you can do it in a separate

00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,750
file or in the same file it's just a

00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:57,779
included file that has some of the logic

00:15:54,750 --> 00:16:01,610
around what we want our client side be

00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:01,610
more our client side application to do

00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:08,459
basically some of the code here you you

00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:10,560
bootstrap your app so you tell angular

00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:13,620
you want startup you bootstrap your app

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,790
and then inside of so you say you you

00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,740
boot strap your app by using these

00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:21,300
what's called directives and that's

00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:25,800
these these tags are attributes that get

00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:28,230
attached to to HTML and you can just you

00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,839
could just you bootstrap your app and

00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:34,800
you can have then you can start using

00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:36,209
angular stuff inside of wherever your

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,589
bootstrapped it's usually bootstrapping

00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:39,689
on the HTML so you can start using

00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:44,819
angular stuff inside and now your HTML

00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:46,980
inside is extended you then so angular

00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:49,529
provides these these directives which

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,449
basically do stuff right like they point

00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:53,160
to JavaScript functions that do cool

00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:56,699
stuff around your site so in this

00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,529
instance ng ng click ng show fees Jake

00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:59,699
where it's pretty simple the similar

00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:01,260
sort of thing where it's a click

00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:02,360
function and show function the

00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,579
difference is

00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,240
the difference difference difference is

00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:11,750
is that you're doing it you're declaring

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,419
it inside of your actual HTML rather

00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,490
than doing it pointing to HTML that's in

00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:20,799
a separate file and it kind of makes

00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:25,880
more sense yeah so in this instance

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:30,289
we're just we're just we're just showing

00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:32,029
a form or removing a hiding form and I

00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:34,039
have these these clunkers I don't know

00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:35,360
it's kind of like a jsfiddle or

00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:37,250
something and through this whole

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,990
presentation because I realize I

00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,389
probably am NOT gonna it's really hard

00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:44,029
to explain code and words I have these

00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:46,730
plunker set up to kind of save me where

00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:49,840
I've done little examples of and luckily

00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:52,279
the internet works little examples of

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,679
all the little things I'm gonna show so

00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:56,870
that's we were able to just like do a

00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:58,730
hide show sort of thing but like I said

00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,679
we're not gonna focus on some of this

00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:05,750
functional stuff we're just gonna kind

00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:08,659
of focus on the ability the the theming

00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:10,370
and and and kind of how what we would do

00:18:08,659 --> 00:18:11,990
in Drupal how would theme something in

00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:18,080
Drupal right with template files and

00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:19,519
stuff yeah so we're we're angular has a

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,049
directive and it's one of the only

00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:26,899
directives that deal with kind of

00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:30,970
putting data into into an HTML file and

00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:34,899
that directive is called ng-controller

00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:38,929
okay so basically you you have a

00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:42,139
function that lives in your app KS or

00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:44,269
whatever javascript file and just like

00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:45,860
Drupal it's very similar this this

00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:48,460
functions very similar like a pre

00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:52,220
process function or you're putting

00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:54,139
you're putting data or you're declaring

00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,120
kind of variables so you have your

00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:59,000
recipe title and we've said burrito

00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,070
recipe body barium and it gets attached

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,919
to this don't don't worry about the

00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:05,389
JavaScript like syntax or anything if

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,639
you play with this a while you'll get it

00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:09,019
so I'm just going to explain what it's

00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:13,340
doing so it's just like attaching it to

00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:15,480
scope which kind of helps us feed our

00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:20,070
data into our HTML

00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:22,560
then you with this ng-controller you if

00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:25,170
you attach it to a div or any element

00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,330
doesn't have to be a div and within that

00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:29,940
div you basically have a template file

00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:33,270
within that div you have a you have a

00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:35,160
scoped amount of data that you can you

00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:38,970
can start you could start using the data

00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,770
that you declared inside of that did but

00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,590
if you try to use that data outside of

00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:45,990
the div it won't understand so basically

00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:49,200
this data gets attached to this Dom

00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,550
element and you can start using it

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,450
inside and start templating so if we

00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:56,070
were to do this so if we were to just do

00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,840
this stuff we would have recipe title

00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,780
recipe body and it would print this out

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,040
you have body very young and italics you

00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,080
know just template and this is all

00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:10,080
remember we're not using PHP we're not

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:13,890
doing this is all in JavaScript so what

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:19,290
if we had a file that had some data in

00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:22,050
it and we wanted to beam that data just

00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:24,150
put a lies around it right that's just a

00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:27,000
lies and then we have the ID and then we

00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:30,990
have the the title how do we do that

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,670
kind of with angular or the client or

00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,280
client side theme so we have a local

00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:37,890
data file that lives in our root

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:42,300
directory right we need to get that

00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:44,070
local data file somehow so what we could

00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:46,160
do is use a service that's provided by

00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:49,620
angular called

00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,190
HTTP it just basically does a HTTP XML

00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:54,090
request

00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:56,520
it's a wrapper around that and get which

00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:58,230
is a kind of rest action that you can

00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:05,010
get something and we're going to get a

00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:09,390
file recipes JSON so we we could say

00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:11,760
scope dot recipes get this file recipes

00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:14,400
JSON and it will load it into the recipe

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,410
scope and so yeah basically it's

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,450
attaching all that file stuff all that

00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:23,730
stuff in our file all those recipes to

00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:27,140
this recipe recipes which is which is

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,140
like just an array of recipes and

00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,780
yeah and then we do the same thing we

00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:34,030
did in our previous example where we

00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:38,020
attach a controller and now we can start

00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:39,670
using recipes inside of this div or if

00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,920
we were declaring another day inside of

00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:43,210
that div or if we had a different set of

00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:48,490
data we could include it onto another

00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:50,860
another div but like this is a cup this

00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:53,470
is like a bunch of recipes you can't

00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:56,710
just wrap HTML bunch around a bunch of

00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:58,750
recipes in Drupal's field dot TPL you

00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,610
would it has a loop function in there

00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:04,390
and you do that with PHP or in twig you

00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:07,030
can do similar sort of thing but angular

00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,830
has has a directive and you can kind of

00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:13,780
start to feel how this is starting to

00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:16,060
work that lets you loop through the

00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:20,230
different recipes so we're gonna put the

00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:21,550
recipe ID - recipe name and this is all

00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:31,630
happening this is all happening

00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:39,700
client-side so yeah so you can yeah here

00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:41,350
we go so yeah so you can do this on like

00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,960
jsfiddle you can do this anywhere you

00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:47,740
can do that on plunker you can basically

00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:54,490
do some like live templating you know

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:58,620
wrap wrap tags around you know our let's

00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,620
see yeah this is dangerous to do this

00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:05,770
yeah so yeah that's the can't really see

00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:08,050
but that's italicized now which is cool

00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:10,210
it's kind of like CSS live reload CSS

00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:13,950
live templating I mean you know just

00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:16,450
live live template I think it's cool

00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,280
yeah and you can see all these punkers

00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:23,230
all these links are here go through and

00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:26,049
play with them and kind of it evolves so

00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:27,820
yes what we did is we use this HTTP

00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:29,049
service the main the main thing that you

00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,710
you're getting here is that we've used

00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:34,720
this service to connect to a local file

00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:39,510
and grab this local file data and we

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:42,970
themed it right but angular wants you to

00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:45,159
put create services so you might in a

00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:47,620
ticular typical theme or a typical

00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:49,539
angular app you're gonna go out and grab

00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,950
a bunch of data from different places so

00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:54,309
you want to organize that data in a

00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:58,389
certain way and angular wants you to do

00:23:54,309 --> 00:24:00,549
it like this yeah so you just declare

00:23:58,389 --> 00:24:03,399
service we're calling it recipe service

00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:04,929
get recipes and you'll see why we do

00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:06,909
this later but we're just extracting

00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:09,429
extracting it a little bit and wrapping

00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:13,480
this this this this get request and

00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:16,710
service our own custom service then our

00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:19,990
controller will then call this service

00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:23,500
to fetch the data basically and feed it

00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:31,919
into our template or our HTML file which

00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:35,620
is our template so remember though that

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:44,799
if we're gonna get some data from a

00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:46,630
Drupal installation Hal JSON and I

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:54,039
showed you with postman that you had to

00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:55,990
actually specify a header how JSON so we

00:24:54,039 --> 00:25:02,559
you can do this manually in your your

00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:06,100
get in your HTTP service but it'd be

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:08,500
nice if every HTTP every get requests

00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,570
that we did used the same header because

00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,490
we know we're going to be connecting to

00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:13,510
if we want to pull data from a Drupal

00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,250
site we're going to be connecting to a

00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:17,620
Drupal site so this is a way you can do

00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,059
that you can just say you know just

00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,950
follow this sort of function this is

00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:23,260
beta this sort of syntax this is

00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:25,450
basically how you how you would do that

00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:28,210
and yeah this HTTP writer provides the

00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:32,630
HTTP service and you're just setting the

00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:36,290
header across it and this is just

00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:39,170
this is depending on which version of

00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:41,710
angular use this is like a little gotcha

00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:46,220
that you may or may not have to include

00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:50,420
I'm not gonna go into it too much let me

00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:54,140
just see it when I'm at time okay yeah

00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:57,760
so here's the cool part in my opinion

00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:00,350
like getting so we can get a local file

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,900
and get some data from a local file but

00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:08,870
what if we want to get a Drupal node we

00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:12,770
want to get information from Drupal I'll

00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:14,210
let that load here we need to go instead

00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:15,620
of going to a local file we need to go

00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:17,510
to our Drupal site and we need to

00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,010
specify a node ID so here's where the

00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,600
service comes in handy because now we

00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:23,780
can wrap a service around it and we can

00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:29,270
specify a node ID as a argument

00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:35,240
basically and yeah and fetch our troop

00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:41,750
both fetch our Drupal data so I'm gonna

00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:46,370
lost here punk or hell okay so here I

00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:51,530
set up a Acquia which wasn't easy I set

00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:56,570
up Acquia Drupal 8 site and yeah so this

00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:58,340
should work yeah so there we go I have

00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:00,920
if you go to this Drupal it's just a

00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:04,370
vanilla Bartok triple Eight's ID if you

00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:08,840
go here and it's basically gone to node

00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:13,430
1 and or a node whatever no dice no to

00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:20,680
leaven and it's loaded up some data into

00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:23,630
a template alright which is pretty cool

00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:27,590
and if you follow that plunker you can

00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:30,530
close these so we don't have to deal

00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:34,280
with them they don't get lost later yeah

00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:38,180
and I can't believe any show you this

00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:41,230
this is my little little site that

00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:43,310
connects to a Drupal site and basically

00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:45,440
it's doing the same sort of sort of

00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:52,519
thing it's going to the Drupal site

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:56,539
and yeah getting each node yeah so

00:27:52,519 --> 00:28:03,139
routing this is this is this is cool

00:27:56,539 --> 00:28:07,009
about these JavaScript and EC frameworks

00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:09,889
like you think like how did that how did

00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:13,370
how do you have different URLs on these

00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:15,110
on these um it's they're called like

00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:16,279
single page app so you think you go and

00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:20,570
there's just going to be one page but

00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:23,480
actually if we're going we have we have

00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:25,820
different pages so look at the URL the

00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,610
URL is changing and this is all powered

00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:30,769
by JavaScript how do how do we handle

00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:32,120
this how do you how do you do that in

00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:40,759
just JavaScript without having a server

00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:43,070
that renders it so this is how we do it

00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:44,840
there's a little module that you include

00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:46,100
so angular has these little modules that

00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:50,350
you can include that do different things

00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:55,009
one of them is called angular route you

00:28:50,350 --> 00:29:01,009
include angular route on your in your

00:28:55,009 --> 00:29:03,470
HTML file and you go to a different you

00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:08,000
go to a route and you click on 'contact

00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:08,750
you click on about and the data from

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,990
that route

00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:13,970
however the logic might be will appear

00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:15,769
just like you could think of page TPL

00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:18,529
like how you have a content variable and

00:29:15,769 --> 00:29:21,019
page about TPL the data will appear in

00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:25,490
this ng view so you can think this is ng

00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:27,679
view as content the content variable and

00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:30,169
page the TPL so how do we specify a

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:33,529
route in our app j s and the place where

00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:36,529
we put our logic this is our index

00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:39,049
obviously and look at this you can use

00:29:36,529 --> 00:29:40,220
external templates and then you feed it

00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:46,639
the controller and the controller

00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:48,440
remember specifies the data so we have

00:29:46,639 --> 00:29:50,899
contact about us and each one of these

00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:54,649
might specify different data sets you

00:29:50,899 --> 00:29:57,590
could imagine having you could imagine

00:29:54,649 --> 00:30:01,320
having different

00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:02,640
different you are different URLs doesn't

00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,220
work it doesn't matter you can imagine

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,970
having different URLs this is local so

00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,970
it's not gonna kill me

00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:18,540
based on whatever you specify contact

00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:21,180
about a submitter recipe arguments so

00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:23,870
one of the key thing that we doing like

00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:28,460
Drupal theming a Drupal site building is

00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:31,200
arguments and use contextual filters

00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:34,650
yeah and angular the note is just route

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,890
params pretty pretty basic kind of makes

00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,890
sense

00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:46,800
basically you specify you could specify

00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:48,240
a wild-card similar in our route similar

00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,120
to like the percentage sign that you

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:56,490
might use in tokens or and in Drupal

00:30:51,120 --> 00:31:00,830
views to to kind of do this let's let's

00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:03,180
in this code here so here's our wildcard

00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:07,470
when you specify your route before we're

00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:09,090
specifying like slash no order or about

00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:12,720
us but we're gonna actually specify a

00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:13,620
variable here and call it note ID and

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,820
then we're gonna link it up to a

00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,340
template let's see if this thing's

00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:19,380
loaded yet so yeah you have it you can

00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,910
have these external templates that you

00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,560
can mark up data and it doesn't you

00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:24,780
don't have to do it all in one file and

00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:30,290
it just goes to that template and marks

00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:33,540
up your data so we have this node HTML

00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:38,100
which might template the node in a

00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:39,600
certain way just like no TPL and we have

00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:43,440
our no control which is going to load

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:48,000
the data into this template so we can

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:51,720
theme it and in our controller for this

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,050
example it's just feeding it a node ID

00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:57,090
so we can say node 1 node 2 but if we

00:31:55,050 --> 00:32:03,600
tie all this stuff together we can

00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:07,679
create no detail pages so remember this

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:11,799
service we used the node ID

00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:13,419
we can tie it together feet we and

00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:16,089
angular you have to feed in dependencies

00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:17,409
I want to get caught too much um you can

00:32:16,089 --> 00:32:21,489
look at the plonkers and learn how to do

00:32:17,409 --> 00:32:23,320
this stuff but we have a route params

00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:25,179
you feeling your route params and we can

00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:31,419
use this service because it accepts a

00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:34,179
note ID and feed the node ID to the

00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:39,599
service and actually as we hit different

00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:48,489
URLs or different node 1 node 2 node 3

00:32:39,599 --> 00:33:03,729
we load in different nodes data how am i

00:32:48,489 --> 00:33:05,229
doing on time here so let's let's look

00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:09,549
at our home page so on our home page we

00:33:05,229 --> 00:33:11,019
have a view of of data and each one of

00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:12,700
these views links to our node details

00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:17,619
page so we've done our no detail page

00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:20,710
but now we need to get a view on the

00:33:17,619 --> 00:33:23,109
home page of this data and then link it

00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:25,629
off to the node detail page and this is

00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:27,639
really cool about like Drupal and Drupal

00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:30,719
7 has this stuff too but it's contrib

00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:36,580
the stuffs in core so views has rest

00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:40,559
support in core and Drupal 8 infuses in

00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:44,369
core obviously too if you go to views

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,369
let's go to a recipe

00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:53,110
yeah so in this example I mean you could

00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:55,630
render the view as a as as a rendered

00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:56,920
entity and it would kind of come out in

00:33:55,630 --> 00:34:00,850
that way but if you want some clean

00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:03,850
output you could just render some fields

00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:05,700
a title image tag body and I've got some

00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:10,120
of this stuff as metadata that I'm using

00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:12,010
and you so you select so you can add a

00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:16,240
rest export just like you could add a

00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:18,429
page or add a feed or or add a block you

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,590
add a rest export and what I've also

00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:25,210
done is I've also added a page because

00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:30,070
the way I understand it rests likes to

00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:32,950
have one resource and then use accept

00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:36,429
headers to go to different ones so if

00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:38,050
you go to recipes slash recipes cuz

00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:40,659
that's what we're using here for a page

00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:44,590
this is just basic triple gives you a

00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:46,179
listing of recipes right um but if you

00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:55,270
go to our postman and we go to the same

00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:57,640
URL it's outputting some data that we

00:34:55,270 --> 00:35:00,610
can beam that might look familiar that

00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:04,390
you can specify and and just and beam it

00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:07,300
out wrap tags around it and we've

00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:08,440
already done well we know how to phim

00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,100
this because we already did it remember

00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:14,070
when we pulled our local our local

00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:17,620
recipes JSON they had a list of recipes

00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:20,200
we're doing that same thing here we've

00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:22,930
pulled our list of recipes and we just

00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:30,300
wrapped h2 around it and you know themed

00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:32,740
it then what we had to do to theme it so

00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,690
filtering sorting and searching so this

00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,550
is some of the application style stuff

00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:38,680
some of the cool stuff angular does and

00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:44,940
one thing that lets you do is like

00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:47,560
specify a filter so in Drupal in Drupal

00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:50,410
we might if we're theming in Drupal we

00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:52,150
might like have Ajax views or something

00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:56,950
like that to do some cool on-the-fly

00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:58,090
sorting but since in angular the data is

00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:02,950
actually bound to the

00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:05,800
URL I mean to the markup we can do some

00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:08,560
sorting and it actually pulls the markup

00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,670
off the page if I inspect this you can

00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,010
just take my word for it but if I

00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:14,530
inspect it the markup just actually gets

00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:16,510
pulled rather than then hidden or you

00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:18,100
know having it to fire a new request

00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:21,420
every time and you can you can you can

00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,420
make it fire any request as well

00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:32,020
yeah which is pretty cool so and I'm not

00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:37,960
going to get into the code that it takes

00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:39,520
to do that I have you can download my if

00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,070
you're really interested in this in this

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,200
particular filter you can download my

00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:48,550
repo that I've specified in the

00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:54,400
beginning so this is this is pretty cool

00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:56,230
too a custom block what if you have some

00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:05,680
data that you want to get out of Drupal

00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:07,930
that is not specified in the rest UI or

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,820
it's not it hasn't been by default it's

00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:11,380
not exportable you have some custom data

00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:14,430
maybe it's not wrapped in an entity you

00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:16,780
want to get some data you can actually

00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:22,260
well what I've done is I've created my

00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:27,730
own endpoint by creating a custom module

00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:30,970
and let's see here I'll show you some

00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:37,050
example here that's this right one here

00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:37,050
it is whoa that's not working

00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:44,150
oh is this fullscreen that's why

00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,150
fullscreen that's why

00:37:47,620 --> 00:38:01,720
here we go come on sorry guys here we go

00:37:54,970 --> 00:38:01,720
okay so that's my review yes

00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:27,619
sorry yeah yeah so I'm just gonna show

00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:31,039
you the file structure really yeah

00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:34,189
so basically created you know rest box

00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:39,459
file a rest blocks module that kind of

00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:42,079
extends it follows DB blog resource so

00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:43,939
if you look at DB log resource I'm like

00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,619
it would get too advanced kind of if

00:38:43,939 --> 00:38:48,289
you're extending classes and stuff go

00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:50,299
look at like functional program is crazy

00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:51,979
for me to get get this stuff but I

00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:54,709
figured it out somehow if you look at

00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:56,599
this DB log resource it's in core it's

00:38:54,709 --> 00:38:59,059
in the rest module you can look on how

00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:00,799
to extend and get your own custom data

00:38:59,059 --> 00:39:04,279
but basically what I've done is I've

00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:08,799
been it created the ability to get a

00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:16,999
block out of Drupal so if you go into

00:39:08,799 --> 00:39:19,189
our Drupal site and you go to if I've

00:39:16,999 --> 00:39:20,809
just linked it up with this feature I

00:39:19,189 --> 00:39:22,130
didn't go and create a new theme you

00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:24,679
could create a new theme that mirrors

00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:26,869
your your old theme that your your

00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:28,819
client-side theme but if I were to take

00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:32,469
this block out of feature because it's

00:39:28,819 --> 00:39:36,019
linked up and save it then it should

00:39:32,469 --> 00:39:37,869
just go away and if I put it back oh no

00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:44,349
it doesn't I'm terrible

00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:48,229
that's because it's connected to my my

00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:51,829
internet theme cool anyway it goes away

00:39:48,229 --> 00:39:53,959
trust me if you if you move it out so

00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:55,249
you can you can create a theme that does

00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:57,289
that you can create some service that

00:39:55,249 --> 00:39:59,319
does that anyway it's so some more stuff

00:39:57,289 --> 00:40:02,059
around your Drupal client side stuff

00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:04,069
posting editing and authentication so I

00:40:02,059 --> 00:40:05,719
didn't do it you can do some post stuff

00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:08,419
so you can actually post data back if

00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:11,150
you look at if you look at cloud C and

00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:13,699
Link Clark's being a presentation you

00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:15,650
can actually post nodes back so you can

00:40:13,699 --> 00:40:16,610
have people do add some editing in your

00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:18,440
theme

00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:21,920
or your app and you can post actually

00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:25,580
post data back into Drupal there's some

00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:30,920
cool angular modules that lead you some

00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:33,260
live editing and stuff so I've really

00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:35,450
talked up this client-side beam like I

00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:37,760
don't know if I you know I need y'all's

00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:39,680
client-side theming and stuff I wouldn't

00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:44,420
actually use any of this stuff in

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:48,770
production this is just so you can get

00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:51,790
an idea around how you might want to do

00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:54,770
some of this theming on the client-side

00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:58,490
if you go to this link here you can see

00:40:54,770 --> 00:41:03,590
a reason a company that had a very

00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:06,380
content heavy website and they didn't

00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:09,320
want to use they had listed some reasons

00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,370
why they didn't want to use angular for

00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,810
the content of your website if you have

00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:13,700
an app if you're building some sort of

00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:15,290
JavaScript app it might make more sense

00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,390
or if you're building a really simple

00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:21,170
theme I'm going to you know definitely

00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:22,760
try to try to do it I'll use it so

00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:25,430
routing remember when we were changing

00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:28,630
all the URLs and stuff now I'm not

00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:28,630
looking code I can look at all of you

00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:36,680
SEO like how does Google go to the

00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:40,160
website and like crawl these different

00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:42,830
URLs in the past they used what was

00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,290
called like hashbang urls which was like

00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:47,660
anchors and made them appear in a way

00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:49,610
that was that looked like it was going

00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:54,070
to different pages but with html5

00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:56,420
history API they were able to kind of

00:41:54,070 --> 00:42:01,030
make it look like you're going to

00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:04,640
different URLs by messing with that

00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:07,130
Google is now reading some of these URLs

00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:11,690
I think discourse which is an ember app

00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:14,780
which is similar to angular their site

00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:16,400
is being crawled by Google without

00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:18,260
having to do anything extra but Google

00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,600
has a whole page on how you might want

00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:22,340
to implement an SEO strategy there's

00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,950
also service called pre-rendered IO

00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,870
which will like look at your Drupal free

00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:28,430
theme that's what I call it for themers

00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:30,170
you know but it's your app your

00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:33,890
JavaScript app

00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:35,390
and and kind of make SEO sense out of it

00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:37,250
but you could also what about Google

00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:39,830
Analytics I mean how does Google

00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:41,630
Analytics know know which URL people are

00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:43,490
going to and what have you and it's kind

00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:45,230
of funny because Google's behind angular

00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:49,670
you think they would have some solutions

00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:51,260
for that learning curve so there's you

00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:56,360
beat some learning curves by not having

00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:58,910
to install Drupal not having to yeah not

00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:00,860
having to do not having to install lamp

00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,030
and having to do any all this stuff but

00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:03,470
you there's more learning curves

00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:04,460
obviously some of that JavaScript if

00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:06,110
you're not familiar with JavaScript

00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:09,230
might be a little bit too much for

00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:12,380
people to understand might be a little

00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:13,700
bit crazy I don't know I'm not a

00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:17,000
JavaScript guy as you could probably

00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:18,410
tell and I kind of figured it out all

00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,090
those plonkers and you should be able to

00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:24,500
to figure out as far as I got

00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:29,300
yeah as far as the client-side

00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:31,400
templating is concerned like yeah Drupal

00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,660
all those classes and markup that Drupal

00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,080
puts in there they put in there for a

00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,780
reason

00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:37,970
it's contrib code people we have the in

00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,500
there so we can map mark our classes to

00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:41,840
Drupal logic and a lot of times it makes

00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,590
sense and it helps us and a lot of times

00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,450
they put stuff in there for

00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:45,980
accessibility that maybe if you're not a

00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:50,750
front-end developer you might not know

00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:53,120
and it might be yeah you might you might

00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:55,580
not want to strip all of the Drupal

00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,720
markup out of out of out of your site

00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:59,000
and that's what you do when you do this

00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,920
client-side theme say goodbye to twigs

00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,510
they goodbye to all of Drupal steam

00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,940
layer stuff you're getting the data out

00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:07,880
raw and there's no help there

00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:10,130
by any and hopefully maybe one day they

00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,420
have some more contrib stuff that helps

00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:13,850
you deal with some of the Drupal data

00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,840
you might get out of out of a Drupal

00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:18,470
site and there's a whole like

00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:22,160
client-side movement as well for this

00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:24,550
sort of stuff but not now so thanks

00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:27,980
everyone

00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:30,470
Twitter that's my Twitter you can get

00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:32,180
the slides there's a client repo if you

00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:34,040
want to download any of the examples

00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:35,030
sorry I wasn't facing you I didn't

00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,070
realize that that wouldn't have been a

00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:38,600
problem that was gonna be a problem but

00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:40,670
I'm glad I got to kind of highlight code

00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,240
and stuff and show you um thank you

00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:43,720
everyone

00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,720
appreciate it

00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:50,610
any any any questions you can come up or

00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:56,430
if you want actually probably have time

00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:58,500
if you want to ask them you can go or

00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:11,120
you can yeah you ask me and I'll repeat

00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:11,120
it hooks so this guy I think he's here

00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:17,270
Vladimir from technocrat he did this in

00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:19,380
in Drupal South he did a session on

00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:21,510
bootstrap and stuff and at the end he

00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,280
had this angular site and I thought it

00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:25,290
was cool and that's why I wanted to do

00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,510
it wasn't like a business use case or

00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:31,220
anything but I'm sure there is around

00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:34,710
that any anybody else yeah yes sir

00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:36,750
so that was my use case yeah you can

00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:38,930
yell it out or I'll repeat or come over

00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,930
here

00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:56,490
so I think their main objection was oh

00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:58,960
yes sorry sorry first time speaker here

00:45:56,490 --> 00:46:03,150
he wanted to know what some of the

00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:06,730
objections were from the site that

00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:11,470
wanted to use angular on and on the

00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:13,089
cheat here on on what we're using

00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:15,070
angular on a content heavy site so one

00:46:13,089 --> 00:46:16,599
thing was SEO obviously which face

00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:18,250
beginning to solve this was written a

00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:20,380
little while ago and that Twitter

00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:21,700
previews like you can't pull in some of

00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,710
the social networking previous which you

00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:27,040
can you can specify mated metadata and

00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:28,660
do that so I don't agree with this yes

00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,970
that's in monitoring analytics I kind of

00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:33,550
dressed that the build tools around

00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:35,410
front-end I think they're easier to use

00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:37,780
than the build tools around back-end

00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:41,800
stuff we're using thing at work and I go

00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:43,480
crazy yeah and then testing which I

00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,190
didn't do angular is really big on

00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:47,260
testing I didn't do any testing with us

00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:48,609
which is bad but hopefully if you're

00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:50,380
using something like angular there's a

00:46:48,609 --> 00:46:52,240
whole - you're abstracting everything

00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:54,579
and we can as front-end developers maybe

00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,740
can start writing tests because I don't

00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:58,510
write I mean I'm I don't write Ted -

00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:00,190
saying who writes tester I'm sure there

00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:00,550
are people who do it really good but I

00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:03,640
don't

00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:06,430
so unfortunately maybe if I start

00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:13,329
writing apps and cool themes and stuff I

00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:16,660
will anybody else yeah thank you for the

00:47:13,329 --> 00:47:19,540
talk yeah yes so my question is you made

00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:21,700
a custom module that has a rest endpoint

00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:23,410
yeah I can show I could show you that

00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:25,210
yeah and the question is how do you make

00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:27,490
that appear on the list of rest

00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:29,680
resources it does it so you extend the

00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:32,170
cool thing like this is me learning like

00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,839
I'm not I'm a front-end developer but I

00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:36,400
did it challenge myself it's it's all

00:47:34,839 --> 00:47:38,410
the entities are kind of done in the

00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:42,220
same way so the way the serialization

00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:45,099
and the rest stuff happens you can

00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:46,900
extend the entity in a similar sort of

00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:48,310
way and it just creates it for you

00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,020
specified in the docs I could show you

00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:51,760
the code it's it's pretty

00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,829
straightforward if you look at DB log

00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,690
resource and that's a guy at work told

00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:58,060
me to do that lis role ensues really

00:47:55,690 --> 00:48:00,250
he's a good Drupal contributor he told

00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:01,100
me you DB log research check that out

00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:03,920
and he won't

00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:07,010
you'll be able to do it for sure anyone

00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,550
else answered my question but I've got a

00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:09,200
quick comment

00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:11,060
Brian Hirsch from the White House web

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,070
team yep I maintain the petitions

00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:15,950
Disraeli you yeah yeah

00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:17,480
so you mentioned rest and yeah you know

00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:19,910
for people who are trying to get into

00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:22,220
stuff and learn rest Roy Fielding's

00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:25,850
dissertation on rest is not really easy

00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:26,690
to read and you know we have found more

00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:29,480
and more as we're dealing with these

00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:31,160
api's the you know restful interfaces

00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,440
are just super important for user

00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:35,560
experience and developer experience so

00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,400
we made a two pager that's sort of like

00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:39,290
accessible for project managers and

00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,930
non-technical people on rest if it's

00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:45,260
helpful for other folks github.com slash

00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:47,330
White House / API standards I'll put it

00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:49,910
in my slides and uploaded I actually saw

00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:52,160
that when I was checking that out yeah

00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:53,570
cool because it's really hard like if

00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,060
you start say we start building sites

00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:58,610
like this it's like where does a lot

00:48:56,060 --> 00:49:00,260
like how is the data coming out like it

00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:01,730
how is it separated it's a lot of stuff

00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:03,830
that back-end developers how they are

00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:07,010
gonna have to have to think about and I

00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:08,180
mean but that that web that standards

00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:10,820
he's talking about actually has some

00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:12,010
good ideas around how to do that thank

00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:15,970
you

00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:18,410
all right so I know your theme ur so you

00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:20,300
wondering how authentication is handled

00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:21,950
as far as in this particular example you

00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,510
know the user was anonymous so you just

00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:25,820
went and grabbed it yeah no no issues

00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:28,130
but what about protected data where only

00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:29,900
certain roles or permissions you know

00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:32,050
would be able to see these recipes how

00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:35,240
do you on the angular side yeah then

00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:36,460
authenticate that person to see the so

00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:38,390
there's different levels of

00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:39,530
authentication you straight if you start

00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:40,880
if you try to set this up you'll

00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:43,730
struggle with it and we'll force you to

00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,920
learn how to do it right so the first

00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:47,570
step is the cookie authentication which

00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,030
basically just checks your Drupal cookie

00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:52,910
similar and then lets you pull based on

00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:54,860
what what cookie you have and that's not

00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:56,420
on the client-side they would have had

00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:58,430
you wouldn't be able to see the node on

00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:00,590
the client-side but if you can't see the

00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:02,750
node then you can kind of access that

00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:04,910
data but if you're pulling it from from

00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:06,350
a client-side beam it it might not make

00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:08,240
sense but there's basic authentication

00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:09,770
what I think hashes the password or

00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,900
something and then there's ooofff

00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:15,080
now OAuth is a way that you know

00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:16,940
applications you know do it and so but

00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:21,950
yeah like I see I'm off on the femur so

00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:23,810
I haven't okay and it's a good there's a

00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:25,610
trooper contrary there's a good contrib

00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:27,500
modules that makes dealing with OAuth

00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:28,910
easy but basically you just select oh

00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,280
and then on your client theme you would

00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:33,500
just put some some passwords and some

00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,300
keys in and then then when you make the

00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:41,650
request from the client nobody else

00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:45,560
would be able to do it I've yet to play

00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:47,960
um you know on this topic of not using

00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,820
it for really big sites it seems like

00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,370
accessibility would be one of the major

00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:54,470
issues with it too because you know the

00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:56,770
big thing for the responsive community

00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:58,850
is making sure that you know if

00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:00,170
JavaScript breaks you should still be

00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:01,970
able to access the content does this

00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:05,390
kind of wipe all that it seems like it

00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:08,630
would I mean once the content has been

00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:10,880
rendered I mean you can see I watched I

00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:13,700
went to j/s conf in Melbourne and they

00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:15,470
had web components and accessibility and

00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,900
accessibility and the shadow DOM and

00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:22,070
stuff and the main takeaway I got from

00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:24,050
that is that yeah like you that that

00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:26,000
stuff will be accessible once the HTML

00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:28,250
has been rendered on the page you can

00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:34,000
there's keyboard accessibility and your

00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:36,110
markup stays you know it's is is

00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,970
accessible basically what do you have

00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:39,740
any particular accessibility concerns

00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:41,810
besides like keyboard accessibility or

00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:43,910
yeah like JavaScript breaking it's

00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:45,230
usually not javascript is not turned on

00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:48,020
be able to do that anymore

00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:50,420
yeah there's a big is not an exact thats

00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:53,480
not an X I build government sites and if

00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:55,430
you look at WIC hag JavaScript not being

00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,650
turned on is no longer I mean as far as

00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:59,750
tell me if I'm wrong but it so easily it

00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:01,580
JavaScript breaks or the external script

00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:03,950
breaks so you need to have testing I

00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:05,950
would think if you're gonna be doing a

00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:08,050
lot of JavaScript heavy stuff and you

00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:10,000
make sure that your test is have a test

00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:11,800
that tests if you JavaScript's broken

00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,570
that way you don't push code that breaks

00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,570
okay cool that's what I would imagine

00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:28,030
else thank ya

00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:32,050
yes is that good

00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:38,339
alright and was me facing the screen

00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:38,339
really bad or was it good fine cool

00:52:38,349 --> 00:52:45,280
you can speaker assessment give me give

00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:49,470
me a you know give me ease because it's

00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,470
