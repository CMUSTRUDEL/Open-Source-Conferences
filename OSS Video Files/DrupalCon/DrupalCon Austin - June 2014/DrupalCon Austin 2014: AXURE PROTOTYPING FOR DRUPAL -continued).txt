Title: DrupalCon Austin 2014: AXURE PROTOTYPING FOR DRUPAL -continued)
Publication date: 2014-06-03
Playlist: DrupalCon Austin - June 2014
Description: 
	Speakers: danigrrl

When working on relatively simple sites, there's a lot you can do directly in Drupal to show clients how content and functionality will work together. But as functionality gets more complex and more stakeholders get involved in decisions about how the site will work, it's easy to lose development hours on code that will end up thrown out as the stakeholders rip apart your ideas.

Wireframes only tell part of the story. To really get buy-in from stakeholders, you need to show them more than what's on a page—you need to show them how something will WORK.

Enter Axure RP. A common tool used by UX practitioners, it allows you to create site maps, user flows and wireframes quickly, within a single application—and makes it easy to add interactive elements, annotate your work, and export working HTML prototypes with the click of a button. In this session, UX Designer and Drupal for Designers author Dani Nordin will share how she uses Axure to prototype complex functionality and get stakeholder buy-in on projects while saving her team development time.

What question(s) does this session answer?

How do I ensure my project is going in the right direction before spending time on development?
How do I manage projects with many stakeholders without losing my mind?
How can I turn my team's ideas into something we can test quickly?
In addition, you'll learn practical techniques for working with Axure to create prototypes that not only give you something testable—without spending days or weeks on Drupal code—but that can also be used to directly communicate important specifications to the development team.

the opening screen

00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:22,699
ooh nice I'm not going to do that now

00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:25,100
okay so this is how I set up this is how

00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:28,220
actor looks when you set it up now what

00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:35,900
I can show you here and I'll go through

00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:39,710
this again for you so you can see these

00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:41,570
words like these little icons here they

00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:46,129
might be a little hard to see but this

00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:51,039
says base then this one says 32768 1024

00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:56,780
1200 so if I pull that out a little bit

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:58,670
base is essentially my it's sort of

00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,190
where all my stuff goes it's my home

00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:05,300
base all right and I keep my base at

00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:08,090
1200 and if i go here i can actually

00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,569
create my grit my grid here so i can

00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:14,630
actually work with a grid system and

00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:16,490
then all i do is click on 1024 and it

00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,200
shows me what it looks like on a 1024

00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:24,190
screen and then I could just nudge

00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:27,020
things over and same thing with 768 and

00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,849
you can see I basically am using the

00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,679
same content and just reflowing it

00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:32,679
similar to what you would do in any

00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:39,170
design exercise and this I haven't

00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:41,599
gotten a chance to do yet but oh that

00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,920
explains why it looked so weird yes so

00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,720
this I haven't gotten a chance to finish

00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:50,890
yet so let me show you how I set this up

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:53,149
so i'm going to create a new document

00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,520
there's a couple of things that i want

00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:58,160
to make sure i have before i start one

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,709
of the things i want to have is the

00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,979
widget libraries that i normally use so

00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:07,039
the widget libraries like i said they

00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:09,770
basically give you a bunch of widgets

00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,319
like rectangles and buttons and links

00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,270
that you can essentially drag and drop

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,280
into your frame so this is similar to

00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:19,460
balsamic if you've ever used it it's the

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:23,930
same basic theory the one that I

00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:27,380
make font awesome is one of the ones

00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,660
that I use constantly and this one

00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,270
called flat widgets is another one that

00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:38,900
I use constantly so i'm going to show

00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:43,270
you where to find them if i go to actor

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:51,050
calm / i want to say it's downloads

00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:54,770
download widget libraries yes so if i go

00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:57,530
here asher com community / community /

00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:03,230
widget libraries I actually can find a

00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:08,060
whole bunch of different libraries that

00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:10,100
I can download most of them are free the

00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:17,300
one that I use that's called flat

00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:20,180
widgets is actually where are you right

00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:25,730
here it's called web widgets so there's

00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:28,640
also bootstrap as a widget library I've

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:31,130
also used sketchy widgets here but

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,100
honestly it's a little limited from what

00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:36,490
i've seen so i stick with flat widgets

00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:41,140
but i'm going to try this common-sense

00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:41,140
UX library

00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:56,680
or you know I'm gonna wait because I

00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:58,210
don't want to how do I get it okay by

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:04,810
now I'm not going to buy something right

00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:07,150
now all right let's say that I was going

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:10,900
to load a library in here what i would

00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:13,270
do is hit this button here and load the

00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:17,260
library okay and then i'm looking for

00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:22,930
something called an RP li be file and i

00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:25,720
actually have those in my dropbox ux

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:29,110
templates i have you here alright so

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:36,120
this right here this RPL I be filed that

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:36,120
is a widget library okay so I'll just

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:45,060
let's do this one because i don't think

00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:45,060
i have it so this one actually has a

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,660
slider that I can use so let's say that

00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,830
I want a slider on the homepage of

00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:55,810
drupal.org so I just drag one in there

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:59,890
and now what I'm going to do is I'm

00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:05,730
going to create a rectangle I'm going to

00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:05,730
use my flat widgets library and here

00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:16,840
I can actually change my default style

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:27,100
here I can use this widget style editor

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:29,920
to actually create a new style and I'm

00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:35,890
doing that because I can create a linear

00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:42,040
gradient and I'll just make it two

00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:44,080
shades of blue and then i can select

00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:50,470
this again and give it that new style

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:52,210
and now i have a blue box and so if i

00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,900
wanted was in a meeting with a

00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:58,620
stakeholder and I wanted to make that

00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,620
gray scale

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,430
I will know in one second how to do that

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:20,210
yeah Oh had it I'm going to get to that

00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,500
in one second actually all right so

00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:27,170
we're not going to do this we're not

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:28,430
going to do that alright so the first

00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,410
thing I need to do is set out my

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,760
adaptive use in my grits right because

00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:38,800
that's going to give me the base to work

00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:38,800
with so I'm going to start by going to

00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:48,070
hold on let me look at my slide deck I

00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,960
loved one I know how to do this as soon

00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,850
as I'm in the middle of doing it and

00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:00,860
then the minute I get to my slide deck i

00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:03,070
forget what i did you ever had those

00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,070
days

00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,800
because I had all the commands here

00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:20,550
okay project adapted these okay so the

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,700
first thing I'm going to do is go to

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:27,000
file project on a project and then

00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:29,550
adaptive views okay and then the

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,140
adaptive views pretty much everything

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,420
that I'm adding to this project I'm

00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,820
going to hit this little plus icon when

00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,010
i get to a dialogue screen and I can

00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:41,010
hear I can actually select one of my

00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:45,870
presets so the first preset i'm going to

00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:49,940
choose is a large display and then i'm

00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:53,630
going to have another one for a

00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,630
landscape tablet ooh

00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:09,669
I'm going to have another one for

00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:13,050
portrait tablet wait okay and then

00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:13,050
another one for portrait tablet

00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,950
another one for portrait phone

00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:31,970
so with that should be able to do is

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:35,020
give me the ability to now set up grid

00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:40,160
and guides by right-clicking and saying

00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:41,750
create guides and now I can chat I can

00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:47,620
decide that I'm going to use a 12 column

00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:50,570
grid on 1200 so that's going to give me

00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:53,920
guides that I can now use to say okay

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,920
this is how I'm creating

00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:08,970
my document ok so here I've got a header

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:16,350
and I'm going to go ahead and just copy

00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:18,870
the Drupal logo from the pages just

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,880
showed you so I'm going to make sure

00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:32,160
that base is selected every time I'm

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:37,500
working so if i go here and then I want

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:40,940
to have a couple of say I want to have a

00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,940
couple of images here

00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:51,000
okay so this is a pretty simple

00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:53,400
drag-and-drop layout and what I'm going

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,880
to see is if i go to 1200 it's going to

00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,350
look like this if i go to 320 it's going

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,790
to look like this but it's going to show

00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:05,310
me it's actually going to show me this

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:08,610
pink line here that tells me where

00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:11,490
everything is going to get cut off so i

00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:16,470
can actually decide on the 320 view only

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:24,960
i'm actually going to delete this move

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:27,330
this up and move this up and then if I

00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:32,790
go back to base everything's still the

00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:39,240
same and same thing with 1200 same thing

00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:40,650
with 1024 so 1024 again is also going to

00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,840
show me where things are going to get

00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:44,310
cut off and so I could just decide okay

00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:48,830
well here that kind of looks like it

00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:53,160
will be good there and here I can also

00:10:48,830 --> 00:11:00,210
set up my grid and guides so this is a

00:10:53,160 --> 00:11:03,590
12 column 960 so this again is going to

00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,590
give me a place to work with

00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:17,520
and then here what I'm going to say is

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,860
this is like really not fitting my my

00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:23,700
drupal association logo is like half off

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:27,350
so i'm going to decide here that this is

00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,350
going to be like this

00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:46,749
and again if i go back to base and 1200

00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:49,929
1024 768 and i can see how all of these

00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:57,279
things are going to change as people are

00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:59,199
looking at them now the other thing i

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,420
want to do is put these buttons in here

00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:05,110
and i'll just copy and and you'll notice

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:08,199
when i select these guys do you see the

00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,879
red dashed line that's around that

00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:12,279
that's because i've created a master

00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:17,160
here okay so i'm going to show you how I

00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:17,160
did that what I'm going to do here is

00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:23,230
I'm in my flat widgets library and I'm

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:27,910
going to find a tab so this is my in

00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:33,209
active tab this is my active tab and

00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:37,899
these are just styled differently and

00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:40,379
for right now i'll keep them at the same

00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:40,379
default

00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:50,220
so we'll keep them as the default styles

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:58,259
for right now because what I really want

00:12:50,220 --> 00:13:04,319
to do is I want to turn this into a

00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:05,699
master so it's always going to be so

00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:10,170
it's always going to be in the same

00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:13,350
location on every page so what I'm going

00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:15,120
to do is take these two along with this

00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:18,089
rectangle in this Drupal logo I'm going

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:22,110
to right-click and I'm going to convert

00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:28,079
to master I'm going to name it drupal

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:31,050
header and so now if I do that I can

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:36,060
actually see it in this masters menu

00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:38,970
here and i can add it i can add a new

00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:41,430
master here but i can also right-click

00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:46,019
and i can add it to every page in my

00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:50,610
document which is what i'm going to do

00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:53,959
right now so now if I go to page 1 i've

00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,959
already got a header

00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:06,940
page to page three the next thing I'm

00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:13,480
going to do is I'm going to do that top

00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:20,560
nav that we have on drupal.org which I

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:22,300
think I had where did I have you which

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,110
is right here get started community

00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:30,279
documentation support download extend

00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:33,160
alright so that's going to be a top menu

00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:41,589
which is a horizontal menu menu

00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:48,610
horizontal and again I'm going to keep

00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:52,740
this white for now get started community

00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,740
documentation so let's just have three

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:10,660
so let's say this is my menu and I want

00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:14,890
this to stay the same here but I want it

00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:18,700
to move in different locations depending

00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:20,800
on where i am in the experience so I'm

00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,380
going to keep this here in my base layer

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,300
and then i'm also going to convert this

00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:31,210
to a master and the reason i want to

00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:34,060
convert this to a master is because if i

00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:35,680
change or add a piece to this menu i

00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,870
want to make sure that it actually

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,160
reflect on all of the pages it's going

00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,700
to be on and this is going to be on

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,700
every page

00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:59,029
alright so this one again I want to look

00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:04,160
at my base layers say okay so on 1024

00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:11,959
it's over here so i need to move this

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:16,759
over here I'm 768 I need to move it over

00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:19,690
here and I might need to now move these

00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:19,690
down a little bit

00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:32,750
and then here I might need to figure out

00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:36,010
an entirely different option for this

00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,010
because it's just not going to fit

00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:50,689
and now when i go back to base i can

00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:56,859
actually edit my top navigation which is

00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:56,859
not what I this also happens sometimes

00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,640
any

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,809
not important right now so if I publish

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,760
this now to actor share what you'll see

00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:39,520
here is I can create an account or it

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,860
can use my existing account and I have

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,210
an existing account but the thing that I

00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:49,809
want to do here is I want to make sure

00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:51,190
that i'm using a generator that's going

00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:52,559
to actually generate all of the

00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:55,650
different adaptive views that i'm using

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,790
so i can actually edit this generator

00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:00,190
it's going to give me all of the pages

00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:02,290
it's going to generate any page notes i

00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:04,540
want to put in it's going to give me all

00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:08,890
of my widget notes my interactions which

00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:10,780
I'll show you in a minute it's also

00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:13,419
going to include any web fonts i'm using

00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:16,770
and this is where we would have for

00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:16,770
example fun awesome

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:28,059
and this is where you would actually

00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:28,059
linked to the CSS file for font awesome

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:37,330
and then I can also give this a password

00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:37,330
but I want right now

00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:00,330
and now we can see the demo

00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:13,099
and we can actually see how it responds

00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:24,310
and it's really that simple it's a very

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,930
traditional process basically what I do

00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:28,630
is I go and I create all of the

00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:35,830
different widgets and I add them to my

00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:40,480
process I add them to my page and as I'm

00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:43,000
going what I might do and I'll show you

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,270
now a different one that I'm going to do

00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,020
so now what I want to do here so we're

00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:52,090
going to work on the dashboard now all

00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,860
right and what I want to do let's say

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:56,080
here what I want to do is I want to

00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,250
actually show in the settings widget I

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:03,130
want to make one of those little

00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:06,310
contextual widgets so what I'm going to

00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:08,290
do that's what we call it dynamic panel

00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,550
so what I'm going to do there is i'm

00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,910
actually going to put this little menu

00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,910
there

00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:21,879
I'm going to put a couple of links in

00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,879
that menu

00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,710
so now I'm going to group all of these

00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:49,900
I'm going to right-click and i'm going

00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:53,160
to convert that to a dynamic panel i'm

00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,160
going to name it configure

00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:07,150
and then I need to set up an interaction

00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:07,150
so that on click I am toggling

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,210
config

00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:36,309
and then I can also set this to hidden

00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:44,620
and what I should see if I preview this

00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:54,340
is that if I click on this it shows and

00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:58,120
so the thing that it didn't do is push

00:21:54,340 --> 00:22:01,600
it to the front so that's a mistake also

00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:03,220
a pretty typical process but obviously

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,850
it's pretty boring to sit here and watch

00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:08,470
me do things so what questions do you

00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:30,670
have in terms of things you'd want to do

00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:33,520
with actor yeah no yeah it's

00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:35,740
specifically it's specifically for just

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,360
generating like I couldn't take we

00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:39,790
couldn't take this and put it into blue

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,100
cheese the reason I created this as

00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:46,929
close to blue cheese as possible was

00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:49,420
because I wanted to be able to not only

00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:55,420
sort of show what it might look like on

00:22:49,420 --> 00:23:04,750
drupal.org but also to to help the

00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:10,690
developers a little bit but that yeah

00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:11,890
that was pretty much it but the biggest

00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,630
things that you want to learn here are

00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,070
dynamic panels and the adaptive views

00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:18,130
other than that it's really pretty easy

00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:20,500
and then the biggest thing that I want

00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:23,350
to do here is because I'm doing this I

00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:31,300
want to create a note that says that

00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:33,580
says contextual menu something there and

00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,940
then I also project i can have page

00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,940
notes

00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:48,040
are there any other and here if you look

00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:50,800
at page style so I can actually decide

00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:59,080
right now that I don't want people to

00:23:50,800 --> 00:24:01,750
look at this in color and want them to

00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:05,070
see it in grayscale and I can also

00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,070
change the font

00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:17,250
so I can decide I want it to be a weird

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:20,640
chalk for key for a 40 font and I can

00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:23,270
make it really sketchy so that way if I

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,270
preview it

00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,240
should give me

00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,120
given me

00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,780
hmm

00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:13,080
okay that didn't work that's strange

00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:37,190
okay so what other things might you need

00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:41,690
to do in a pro in a prototype yeah yeah

00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:49,460
yeah so for example like name like an

00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:52,640
interaction okay so there's two ways

00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:56,360
that you can do navigation if I do that

00:25:52,640 --> 00:26:03,140
menu that I showed you so that

00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:07,909
horizontal menu so this horizontal menu

00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:09,860
I can actually add sub items so i can

00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:15,470
add this item and then i can actually

00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:17,380
add sub menus and so in that case all of

00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:19,760
the interaction is built into the menu

00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,650
so you don't need to even worry about it

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:26,570
you just use this and you're and you're

00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:31,100
done if I'm trying to do more of like a

00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:32,809
drop-down fly out kind of menu yeah like

00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,210
what I did with the gear that's the kind

00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:41,870
of panel that you have to use and I want

00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:45,590
to I want to see how I can and I want to

00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:49,270
fix the interaction there because that

00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:49,270
wasn't quite the right way

00:26:53,460 --> 00:27:01,799
so yes interactions are basically the

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:04,529
way that you are basically the way that

00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:06,149
you actually configure the different

00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:08,190
dynamic panels and one of the things

00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:10,710
that gets really complicated is you can

00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:13,169
actually nest dynamic panels inside

00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:15,390
other dynamic panels and the same way

00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:18,149
you can dine you can nest masters inside

00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:19,830
of other masters so the biggest thing

00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:22,140
and this is like if you've used

00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:26,880
photoshop for web design is exactly the

00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:28,860
same thing name your elements name them

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,690
and annotate them as you go because

00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:36,510
otherwise you give yourself a huge

00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:38,549
headache yeah so see now it works and so

00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:45,059
that interaction was actually a toggle

00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:50,010
and then if I want I can go in and move

00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:53,029
this down a little bit and so I can

00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:58,830
actually now make this a master and

00:27:53,029 --> 00:28:03,440
actually even make more of them if I

00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:05,909
wanted to or I could do like some kinda

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,220
miss I could actually make this entire

00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:12,539
thing and I probably would make this

00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:16,289
entire thing a dynamic panel because

00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:18,630
this button this little X actually

00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:25,500
closes the box and makes it disappear so

00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:27,210
then I would actually take this I forget

00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,679
exactly how i do it I would take this

00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:32,220
box and I would convert this to a

00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:35,210
dynamic panel and then create an

00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:39,090
interaction on the X that closes the box

00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:42,539
and makes the whole thing hide does that

00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:44,490
make sense so so a like it takes a

00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:46,409
little bit of working out to figure out

00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:49,559
but no different than you would coding

00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:52,710
it in JavaScript and the entire point of

00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:57,720
this block is that I'm actually able to

00:28:52,710 --> 00:29:02,309
take my notes and I can make actual

00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,539
suggestions on how we should treat this

00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:06,309
box

00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:08,230
so the team and I can actually discuss

00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:09,970
what so what is it that happens with

00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:11,379
this element what is it that happens

00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:14,320
with this box and then if I really

00:29:11,379 --> 00:29:18,029
wanted to you know create some

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:23,019
discussion I can use my call-out library

00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:25,419
which is right here and i can say okay

00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:27,730
well this is number one so every comment

00:29:25,419 --> 00:29:32,860
you have about this box preface it with

00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:35,169
the number one alright so that's adding

00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:37,269
a second layer of annotation because you

00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:40,240
can't necessarily respond for example to

00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:43,029
this note but you have to make comments

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,100
on this so how is it that we make sure

00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:46,720
that they're going to be able to add the

00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,369
comments that they need to and I'm going

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,350
to be able to organize all the comments

00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:53,799
especially when we have a ton of people

00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:55,419
commenting on typically when I'm

00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:58,769
designing this it's like me and a couple

00:29:55,419 --> 00:30:02,289
of people in a room so it's not a huge

00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:04,240
volume of comments but I can just

00:30:02,289 --> 00:30:06,190
imagine when i'm posting something like

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,129
this that's for the entire community to

00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,840
comment on that being able to sort of

00:30:09,129 --> 00:30:12,690
filter through the comments and figuring

00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:16,990
out exactly what they're talking about

00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:18,940
is going to be really important so the

00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:21,039
workflow once you get used to it is

00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,200
really easy but dynamic panels are the

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,999
majority of what you're doing and so is

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,759
creating notes and annotations and

00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:30,820
interactions but once you do that you

00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:33,639
can also create an interaction like this

00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:37,210
for example we could actually make link

00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:43,389
to another page that goes to the issue

00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:46,509
queue as an example so i could

00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:50,889
conceivably build this entire thing out

00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:53,379
so profile to all of the different

00:30:50,889 --> 00:30:55,990
spaces that you're going through we can

00:30:53,379 --> 00:31:01,470
see how those screens might look when

00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:03,610
you're on GDL or or on or on dido

00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:07,119
because i'm going to be doing this for g

00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:10,749
do too so you can see how this might add

00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:12,879
some efficiency to your workflow and how

00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:15,759
it might be sometimes difficult to

00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:16,310
figure out you know when to give this to

00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:18,650
develop

00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:22,280
but the thing I love about this is you

00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:25,250
could ping someone in IRC with a link to

00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:30,110
a page and say hey look at this and give

00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:31,790
me feedback or you could ping someone

00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:34,370
over skype on your team and say I need

00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:36,020
feedback on this can you you know and

00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:38,930
you can do it just as much as you would

00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:41,060
in you know just as much as you would if

00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,320
you're building something in Drupal but

00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:46,460
you're able to whip this out in like

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:50,330
half an hour as opposed to you know who

00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:54,920
knows sometimes if you're not like a

00:31:50,330 --> 00:32:00,080
hardcore command line developer are

00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:01,700
there any other questions is there

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:12,290
anything else that you'd like to see in

00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:16,160
terms of how this is used yeah yeah oh

00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:26,510
yeah absolutely so let's say that we

00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:29,650
wanted to do a persona persona so let's

00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:29,650
say I want to do a persona

00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,300
so I'm going to go back to my flat

00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:45,030
widget so I'm going to pull out an image

00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:45,030
and I'm going to

00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:04,619
alright so let's say that this is my

00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:04,619
persona

00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:40,200
so this is exactly like you would do any

00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:40,200
other any other document

00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,920
you just put in your text you put in

00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:57,160
your heading one you're heading to same

00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,160
thing

00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:16,629
and you can just grab this and start

00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:16,629
creating a bulleted list

00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:39,580
and then when you preview it it's

00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:39,580
exactly the same and you can click on it

00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:48,040
now if i want to create a site map

00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:58,520
let's say I want to have the homepage be

00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:05,170
a site map of all of the different pages

00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:05,170
on here I can actually drag these pages

00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:10,210
into here

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:26,980
and I can use this little guy to connect

00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:26,980
here to here

00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:36,190
and when I preview this I now see that

00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:38,979
there's these little links here these

00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:41,849
little boxes here and I can actually go

00:35:38,979 --> 00:35:41,849
to any of those pages

00:35:54,370 --> 00:36:02,230
and I could conceivably put this

00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:05,010
anywhere in my sight I could even make

00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:05,010
that the bread crumbs

00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,670
any other examples

00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:26,609
alright so I mean that's a pretty basic

00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,890
overview obviously it was relatively

00:36:26,609 --> 00:36:31,319
quick but hopefully it gave you enough

00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:32,880
to sort of get started and get your own

00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:35,670
ideas on how you can play with this

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,710
stuff I'll actually be around and I'll

00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:40,290
stay here so if you guys want at like

00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,910
come up and ask me questions and have me

00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:45,540
show you how to do stuff I'm totally

00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:47,609
happy to do that and thank you guys so

00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:49,700
much for your time this has been really

00:36:47,609 --> 00:36:49,700
