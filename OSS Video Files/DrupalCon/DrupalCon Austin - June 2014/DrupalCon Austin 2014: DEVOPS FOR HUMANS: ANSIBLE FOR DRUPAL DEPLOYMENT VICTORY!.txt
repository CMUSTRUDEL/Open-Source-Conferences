Everyone knows it's a Good Idea™ to use a configuration management system (e.g. Puppet, Chef) to manage your Drupal infrastructure. But many people (myself included) have run into a wall of #wtfmoments when trying to learn the vagaries of traditional CM systems and their vendor-specific syntaxes.

In 2012, Ansible was released, enabling normal human beings to manage their servers with an easy, but powerful, CM system that uses YAML (just like Drupal 8!) to define configuration and Jinja2 (very much like Twig!) for templates. Not only that, but Ansible is also an incredibly simple and very flexible Drupal deployment and continuous delivery tool.

Learn how you can use Ansible to manage your infrastructure—including local development environments—and stop letting servers and deployments get in the way of development.

Most of the examples in this presentation will come from real-world examples of Drupal sites running on varying types of infrastructure (AWS, Digital Ocean, etc.), as well as local development environments managed with Vagrant and VirtualBox. For some simple examples, check out geerlingguy's Ansible Vagrant Examples on GitHub, and see how simple it is to build servers running LAMP, GitLab, Jenkins, Solr, etc.

Jeff Geerling (geerlingguy on Drupal.org) has been working with Drupal since 2005, and is writing a book on Ansible, Ansible for DevOps: Server and configuration management for humans. You can find him on Twitter: @geerlingguy.
