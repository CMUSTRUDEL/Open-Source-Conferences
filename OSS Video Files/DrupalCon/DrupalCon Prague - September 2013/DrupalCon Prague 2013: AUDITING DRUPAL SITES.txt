Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: AUDITING DRUPAL SITES
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	We're doing a lot of audits for Drupal sites. What do we look for when doing an audit? What should your Drupal installation take care of to pass the audit with flying colors? Why are clients contracting us to audit sites and why does that make a difference in what we're looking for?

In this session we'll go through different perspectives for doing Drupal audits. We'll look at the different purposes of an audit and try to show enough case examples for the audience to get a comprehensive view on the whole business of Drupal auditing.

The session will be held by Kalle Varisvirta, Technology Director at Exove and also the main responsible person in doing Drupal audits in the company.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
my name is calabar espÃ­rita i'm from

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,650
finland working for a company called

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:18,330
excel i'm here to talk to you about all

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:21,980
thing to pull sides some things that i

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:24,840
just want to say is that i'm going to be

00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:29,580
going in and out of drupal in the

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:32,730
technical matter as well so some parts

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,190
might be difficult to understand if

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,920
you're not a technical person then some

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:46,350
parts might be boring if you are so

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:48,480
hopefully i bore all also some

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:53,820
understanding of the business involving

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:58,680
dribble should be useful all listening

00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:08,790
to me so um let's get a hands up first

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:11,659
for technical people ok and then drupal

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,659
businesspeople okay

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:25,520
our fair share both what hmm what I'm

00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:27,410
going to talk about here is that why our

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,600
duple audits done in the first place

00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:34,460
there are several different reasons for

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,260
those how they are done and I'm going to

00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:40,370
include some technical details as i said

00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:42,170
earlier and then i'm going to go briefly

00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,270
into the business of triple audits there

00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,610
are some challenges that needs to be

00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:56,030
taken into account when doing audits as

00:01:46,610 --> 00:02:12,800
a business so let's start what's an

00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:17,110
audit audit yep that's I'd wonder if I

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:29,060
can switch off the lights from somehow

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:30,830
anybody okay better okay good atlas for

00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:35,180
that for the light switching guy thank

00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:37,700
you okay so all it is a run to of an

00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,640
implementation of a site that means that

00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:46,730
an experienced developer goes to a site

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:48,920
in and out all aspects of it it doesn't

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:52,780
mean that he reads every role of code

00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:57,080
but it's a very thorough thing usually

00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:59,900
and as I said all its I've done for many

00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:04,340
different reasons and the process of

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:09,709
doing in our it varies a lot we'll get

00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:14,480
to that next but so how many of you have

00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:17,530
done an audit okay

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:24,590
how many of you had your work

00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:26,629
scrutinized by an audit less people we

00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:30,530
have more auditory system to get the

00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:37,060
people getting audited okay good one all

00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:41,230
right why are why are all it's done so

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:43,160
we have four categories of audits

00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,409
acquisition audit implementation

00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,120
verification audit vendor management

00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:49,280
audit and support or these are not

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,519
official categorizations of audits this

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:58,329
is just my hunch of how I would divide

00:03:52,519 --> 00:04:06,079
them into groups acquisition on it

00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:09,980
that's part of a well it's usually done

00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:13,849
before making the decision to buy a

00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:16,400
business that means that it's part of

00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:17,630
the due diligence process and some of

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,490
you might know what that means but that

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:25,310
means a investigation of a company

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:28,669
before signing a contract usually to buy

00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:31,130
it so that's for acquisitions that that

00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:33,260
means obviously due diligence means also

00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:37,630
the financial side and all the others

00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:43,099
but when the company's business involves

00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:45,979
web or the site in really key aspect of

00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:47,630
it then it's usually a really key aspect

00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:54,190
of the whole due diligence to do the

00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:57,979
audit for the side usually they are done

00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:03,820
obviously the smallest startups anyone

00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:03,820
who base their whole business online and

00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:14,120
it's a very in depth and focuses on kind

00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:17,120
of a hidden agenda usually the company

00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,960
that's buying the other company the

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:25,100
boiler has plans for the site and they

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,290
don't tell the target of the of

00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,240
of the deal what those plans are but

00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,860
they audit the auditor needs to know

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,300
what what those plants are so you need

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,770
to know what what they want to do with

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:40,040
the site so you can actually audit it in

00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:41,660
a proper way the next category is the

00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,640
implementation of verification or it I

00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:47,750
would say that's just to verify an

00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:49,640
implementation of a site that's more

00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,800
like an insurance policy the customer

00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,880
just wants to pay to do not have any

00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:59,960
problems they're not expecting a lot of

00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,660
problems these are usually pretty brief

00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:06,550
done in collaboration with the with the

00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:10,760
vendor was working with the site and

00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:13,130
shouldn't ever be done to a system

00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,840
that's not finished by the way when you

00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,280
see those lines that shouldn't something

00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,100
shouldn't dump that's that's something

00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,590
that I've done and then I feel bad for

00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,680
doing it so it's something that I

00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:29,590
learned so don't do it for unfinished

00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,590
systems because you that's just stupid

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,040
then there's the vendor management audit

00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:41,570
and this is a bit complicated one that

00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:43,730
means that your customer who's buying

00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:48,800
the audit is wanting to switch their

00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:53,960
vendors not necessarily to you but to

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,490
something else and they usually have

00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,450
some problems with the current vendor

00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:01,700
and that makes it a bit difficult

00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:03,770
because usually they don't tell the

00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,980
current vendor that this is happening so

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,360
you'll have to do it without any help

00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,820
for the curve from the current vendor

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:18,620
and that makes an audit a bit harder

00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:23,540
we'll come to that also this might be

00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:27,350
very brief but usually it's it's a bit

00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:29,660
longer audit my long I started that I've

00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,910
ever done was a vendor management or it

00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,910
took about more than 30 million days to

00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:37,510
do that wasn't the Drupal though was it

00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:42,340
was custom code a lot of it

00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:45,040
and this time the client expects to find

00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:47,140
something that taken based on their

00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,620
their decision to switch vendors they

00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,000
might just have a personality clash with

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,370
the current vendor but they still want

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,740
something to base their decisions on and

00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:59,500
you shouldn't go into that trap we can

00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,180
we come to that later as well then

00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:05,080
there's the support audit this is when

00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:13,570
it happens when you move an existing

00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:16,210
system to to your support unfortunately

00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:18,730
this very important order to you but not

00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:21,790
very important to anyone else so you

00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:25,210
won't probably get get paid a lot or

00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:27,880
paid at all doing this but you should

00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:30,690
still do it this means that you'll be

00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,680
getting someone else's code into your

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,890
support and you'll have to support it

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:42,280
later on and then you should do an audit

00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:43,690
at least a brief one and this is also

00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,450
the type of audit where you can learn

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:49,450
from the experience because in the long

00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:51,910
run if you take an existing side to

00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:54,100
support you'll find you'll find out all

00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:57,010
the problems with the side you'll also

00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:00,000
learn what you missed in the audit so

00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:03,010
this is a really learning experience

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,940
unfortunately this it's also when it's

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,590
when it's a really good learning

00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,970
experience also have been pretty nasty

00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,250
one because you have a really broken

00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:15,850
site in your support that happens every

00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:23,920
once in a while so going to how it's

00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:27,990
actually done tip 1 you always need the

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,990
source code always

00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,630
first and foremost okay start taking

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,610
notes from day one you need you need

00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,860
those notes to back your memory up

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,710
you'll forget everything and remember

00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:45,410
stuff wrong later on then you'll have to

00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:47,960
go back and recheck and even though it's

00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:53,300
fun it's kind of exhilarating together

00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:54,650
get a USB stick of some code you never

00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,720
seen before and you want to just

00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:58,970
investigate go through everything once

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,220
you should write notes while doing that

00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,779
because you'll forget to do that and

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,430
you'll forget everything you saw and

00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:07,040
you'll just remember that it might have

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:09,440
had this in this file and this directory

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,720
somewhere and then you have to recheck

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,140
and how to do your work twice or three

00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,830
times secure the source code as I said

00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:22,150
you always need to search source code

00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:25,820
ask for a dumb from the of the database

00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:28,730
now there's the whole concept of having

00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:31,730
private data in the database and which

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:35,510
is kind of problematic sometimes it's

00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:37,339
possible to obfuscate the most private

00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,410
parts of it Social Security numbers or

00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:40,820
something like that in the database so

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,740
you can actually get the data because

00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,630
you need the data as well because you

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,390
have to see how how the system works

00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:53,540
with data without data it's kind of a

00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:56,180
shell the obfuscation is done by the

00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:59,690
current vendor or or the your customer

00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:02,089
if they can they can do that it's

00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:09,500
sometimes very hard sometimes even

00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:11,270
impossible and well you just need it so

00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:15,110
you'll just have to figure out a way to

00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:17,780
do that do it somehow and don't ever

00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:20,900
settle for for partial source code now

00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:24,890
this is a really typical thing I keep

00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:27,470
hearing will just give you um the custom

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,360
modules that's not enough you need all

00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,640
the modules you need all the source code

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,339
there might be hacks in core there might

00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,290
be hacks in the content modules and

00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:37,940
there might be stuff in the wrong places

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:42,110
all around and there might be some

00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:43,130
really odd configurations in in a non

00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:49,460
hacked core

00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:52,880
well you need the whole Drupal I've been

00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:56,270
hit with this once we had a really juicy

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,160
big customer and I tried to persuade

00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:01,250
them give me everything but they didn't

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,490
they only gave gave us the custom custom

00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:08,780
custom modules and when we finally got

00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:11,740
the whole site into our support it had

00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:14,540
two cores running different versions

00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:19,700
side by side you can imagine what kind

00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:23,710
of a mess that was well is unfortunately

00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:33,110
still is totally impossible to update

00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:34,730
well let's try forget that anyway then

00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:38,270
the next thing you should do is to

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:40,700
install the site now this might sound a

00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:42,350
bit odd they have an existing site

00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,030
installation somewhere but but

00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:46,790
installing a site gives you a lot of

00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:48,470
insight into the holes Oh thing have you

00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:51,530
ever have you ever done your custom

00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:54,500
modules and done a lot of update hooks

00:12:51,530 --> 00:13:01,640
there and forget to update the install

00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:03,500
hook yeah that's why so you'll learn

00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,410
what's missing from the system and

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,380
what's not documented or what tweaks

00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:11,750
need to be done that that's not supposed

00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:15,040
to be there and you'll probably have to

00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:17,900
stop several times getting more data

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,660
code varnish vc else i've actually

00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:24,260
rewrites api definitions to create dummy

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:30,530
api's we serve enough calendar time for

00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:34,760
this and it's still worth the time next

00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:37,300
thing you must understand the

00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,300
architecture

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:44,810
once you have installed the site look at

00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:46,580
the architecture if your Drupal sites

00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:50,450
are based on different combinations of

00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:57,080
modules certain combinations of conjured

00:13:50,450 --> 00:14:00,230
modules you can do blocks with context

00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:04,660
or panels you can search with Search API

00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:07,310
maybe Apache sorts or search integration

00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,470
translates ten translations you can use

00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:13,640
internationalisation you can use field

00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:16,820
translations translate blocks use a

00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:20,570
multi-site maybe you can control access

00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:23,530
by domain access taxonomy access so

00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:26,210
plenty of options you have your favorite

00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:29,200
option obviously you have your favorite

00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:33,590
comb combination you know them by heart

00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:35,360
don't be biased they're probably not the

00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:38,840
only way to do it and it's it might be

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,940
just equally proper way to do stuff even

00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,400
though it's not the way you do stuff so

00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:47,260
don't don't get biased by your own

00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,260
opinions on which contracts to use

00:14:53,200 --> 00:15:01,150
next on architecture does it fit its

00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:03,540
purpose if you see a Drupal and all the

00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:07,840
custom code in the triple is just

00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:11,380
circumventing the shortcomings or or

00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:13,960
drupal's practices because it doesn't

00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:17,230
fit the bill then it's not right tool

00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:19,120
for doing that and I know this might get

00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:22,080
me killed same double Conda to go isn't

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,630
suitable for everything but it isn't so

00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:29,260
in some cases you have to see that it

00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:31,060
this is not just not the right tool it's

00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:35,110
the site using Drupal as it should I've

00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:38,200
seen a lot of well several sites using

00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:40,810
Drupal in a way that it has like three

00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:44,110
pages out of tuple and then everything

00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:45,880
else goes to a custom module to some

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,520
custom back-end and pushes data from

00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,280
there just an empty shell with some

00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:54,430
theming on it that's not a proper way to

00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,350
use tuple usually the customers are

00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,210
asking that why does why doesn't any

00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:00,040
contracts do anything to my site that's

00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:05,970
because your site isn't on Drupal

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,970
relates somewhere else that happens all

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,390
the custom parts somewhere I want

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,630
whether it's a while working contrib

00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:16,360
available the custom parts might be

00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:22,240
built well and all and they might be

00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:25,720
even good for the purpose but if there's

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,900
a contrib available you have to judge by

00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,580
looking at the contribs possibilities

00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:34,750
and the custom code that which one would

00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:37,810
be better at least have an opinion about

00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,520
it and you write the report and then you

00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:43,060
have to look at if it's already

00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,560
complicated obviously triple sites can

00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,690
be already complicated and they can be

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,760
for various different reasons or really

00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:51,330
complicated but you'll have to report

00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,330
that as well

00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:02,690
so make sure you understand the

00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:05,660
architecture it might take you a long

00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:08,170
time and it's it's really easy to fall

00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,610
in the trap of just writing the report

00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:13,370
without understanding the whole thing

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:14,810
but you really really really need to

00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:16,490
understand how the architecture works

00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,380
what were they thinking when they were

00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:21,050
doing it because if you write your

00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,970
document and report your audit report

00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:25,040
without understanding the whole

00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:30,080
architecture it's just going to be a bad

00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:33,170
report and it might it might take days

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:37,070
to go to the code and go to the modules

00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:40,060
and wonder why is this done why is this

00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:42,770
done what is this why is it here but

00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,960
when you finally realize why it was done

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:48,080
didn't actually write an intelligent

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,670
document saying what what what should

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:55,520
have been done on what should be done

00:17:49,670 --> 00:18:00,710
next best then there's the whole concept

00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:02,990
of reading code remember reading cold

00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:08,090
isn't the main purpose of an audit it's

00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:10,120
not a code review but reading code isn't

00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:13,340
a big problem in Drupal audits and

00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:18,740
there's usually relatively little custom

00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:20,420
code to be read and if you can if you

00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:26,000
have trouble finding it for instance

00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:31,010
it's if it's not in modules / custom and

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:35,990
you might find it with hacked if it's in

00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:39,920
totally wrong place and when there's a

00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:42,920
lot of code as sometimes is remember you

00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:46,010
can't read it all being cold wrote about

00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:50,960
row by row doesn't make doesn't benefit

00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:54,580
anyone so when you're going to be

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,580
reading code and there's a lot of it

00:18:54,670 --> 00:19:01,100
focus on the parts that make that make a

00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:04,300
difference in the end result look at

00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:06,950
security holes look at beginner mistakes

00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,929
look at performance problems these are

00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,309
the typical ones you want to list on

00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:14,440
your

00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:17,110
our findings report when you're looking

00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:21,190
for security holes well here's just a

00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:24,100
checklist this is totally not exhaustive

00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:25,720
list so there's plenty of more stuff to

00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,830
look but I'm just listening a couple of

00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,830
things here just to give you an idea

00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:31,539
what you would be doing check for SSL

00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:38,129
log in check for all condoms without

00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:41,350
patches checks check for abstractions

00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:44,769
unclean inputs in the UI JavaScript love

00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:47,110
XSS available their API calls without

00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:49,179
HTTPS to the backend systems this is

00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:52,330
something that happens ever so often

00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:55,629
that we connect to a CRM back there

00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:58,809
somewhere and there is love leads gets

00:19:55,629 --> 00:20:01,320
left on the development settings and

00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:04,179
then data is going to http without any

00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:08,350
protection and there's personal personal

00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:11,019
information there begin your mistakes on

00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,850
clean access to Drupal that's what

00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:16,200
happens when beginners start with Drupal

00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:21,759
and they don't really know how to do it

00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:24,970
look for unnecessary custom modules well

00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:27,220
obviously have to think that also the

00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:29,889
time span where the concepts available

00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:32,110
when the custom code was made Britain or

00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:38,159
is it doing exactly the same thing as

00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:41,200
the content modules look for wrong hooks

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,759
that's something also that happens every

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,190
once in a while that people just use a

00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:46,659
hook they find first and that's probably

00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:50,950
not the hope that they should be using

00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:54,850
so they might run stuff too frequently

00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:57,730
for instance performance problems static

00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:59,740
cash is time-consuming functions check

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:03,360
out the amount amount of processing in

00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:05,230
it hooks look for slow back and AP ice

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,990
that's something that you can't do

00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:10,809
anything about but you might want to

00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:12,879
list that on your report check out the

00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:16,149
caching strategy there are plenty of

00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:19,289
different crafts and strategies but you

00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:21,850
should definitely have one at least well

00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:22,570
we don't cache anything is a caching

00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:28,440
strategy

00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:31,419
as long as it works look for unnecessary

00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,850
so but where it's low country muscle use

00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:36,610
or misuse of contrib modules I've seen

00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:38,110
that as well site crashes every once in

00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,580
a while it uses a contract module for

00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:45,340
something that it definitely shouldn't

00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:47,919
be used then there's the whole social

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:51,130
engineering side side off of the whole

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,840
audit you'll be talking not in all

00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:55,860
audits but but most audits you'll be

00:21:52,840 --> 00:22:00,100
talking with the original developers and

00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:01,600
it's very important don't miss that

00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:05,799
opportunity if you have an opportunity

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:10,059
to interview the original developers do

00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:13,570
please do that they'll tell you not only

00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:16,720
how it works but why it works in a in a

00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:19,090
certain way they might even tell you

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,980
that this in this part is totally wrong

00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,450
and we had to do it like this because we

00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:26,190
retire on time or something like that

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,190
they'll point you straight to problems

00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:35,620
just be polite and friendly um I I wrote

00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:37,539
a blog post about the social aspect so

00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:42,639
far it's just a couple of weeks back I

00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:44,110
had a couple of lines there what you

00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:47,169
should do when talking with the original

00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:49,409
developers they were first introduced

00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:52,509
yourself your background and your

00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:54,639
expertise you get there respecting that

00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:56,379
in that way explain what your task is

00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:58,870
and what is what it will what it's not

00:22:56,379 --> 00:23:00,580
what it what what is not your task so

00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,750
your task is not to blame anyone or

00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:05,799
something like that you're just trying

00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:10,389
to find kind of a understanding of how

00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:13,419
the system is right now don't speak any

00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:15,370
of your findings out loud when you're

00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:16,929
looking at someone over someone's

00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,879
shoulder and you see something really

00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:21,730
horrible it's sometimes really hard to

00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:23,259
not gasps do something like that but you

00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:27,460
just have to keep your march shopping

00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:30,580
smile and nod and you use positive

00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:34,210
language always you're not there to find

00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:39,350
out problems it's just that verify its

00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:41,450
good as they claim it is and when you

00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:44,600
are asking questions about the code be

00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:45,980
very understanding of the situations but

00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,039
the original developers they probably

00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:51,169
we're busy and there were demands all in

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,750
all different directions and stuff like

00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:56,120
that and if they deny you something you

00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:59,120
need you really need talk with your

00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:01,460
customer and don't go bossing around in

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,269
someone else's office you won't get any

00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:09,200
friends like that let your customer do

00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:14,720
the whole telling people stuff for you

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:25,880
you don't want to do that but it's not

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:27,950
just the code um okay you might have a

00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,200
really good site really professional

00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:35,059
email side and it's installed by total

00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:38,779
newbie doesn't doesn't come up with a

00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:40,429
good result cut at all so always look at

00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:42,529
the production environment now this is

00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:44,809
something that is usually pretty

00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:47,000
difficult to get which is access to

00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:49,669
production but you should try and do

00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,519
that because if you don't see how it's

00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:54,320
actually run in production you probably

00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:58,370
miss out a lot of what's actually

00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:01,909
happening in the site you at least need

00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:05,690
to read access to the production or or

00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:07,970
at least a copy of all relevant

00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:09,649
configuration files the problem is

00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:11,510
though that you should verify that you

00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:13,970
actually have all the configuration

00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:16,399
files that they have and you can if you

00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:18,919
don't have access even if you have

00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:20,149
access supervised so that someone's

00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:23,360
looking over your shoulder when you're

00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:24,860
poking around that's okay you can poke

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,130
around as I said keep your mouth shut

00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:33,260
but folk around make mental notes don't

00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:35,120
write them at that point so there's a

00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:37,309
lot to check in the production

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,500
environment obviously for for for

00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:43,159
security for performance for light

00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:45,679
reliability installation and server

00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:47,080

my skill not the databases replication

00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:02,559
configurations backups by the way that's

00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:06,309
that's a wonderful thing ask if they do

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:09,940
backups they say yes then maybe they do

00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:11,649
you can't usually check that but you can

00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:17,590
just hope that they were telling you the

00:26:11,649 --> 00:26:21,010
truth check for open port services

00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:23,740

configurations do check the solar CMOS

00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:34,590
as well if you're poking around in solar

00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:38,799
take a look at the drupal configuration

00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:40,600
user roles and privileges registration

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,970

00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,559
settings content module settings content

00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:47,710
modules might have really scary settings

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:49,120
beware go look at them it might be you

00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:53,350
might have trouble finding them as well

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:55,179
they might not be well listed anywhere

00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:58,260
you just have to look at the module to

00:26:55,179 --> 00:27:01,230
see if it has any many many callbacks

00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:03,909
custom module settings even scarier

00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:06,940
usually they might be just config files

00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:09,159
on the disk make sure you check them

00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:11,700
because they might have really really

00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:11,700
scary stuff

00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:19,730
SC o connor s zo configurations that's

00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:23,960
something that people tend to forget us

00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:23,960
developers we don't think about SEO

00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:30,420
clean up for automatic imports an

00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:33,540
automatic feed import running some

00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:36,530
errors RSS feeding my chewing a lot of

00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:40,050
data over time it might have have a

00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:42,440
really big chunk of stuff in the

00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:53,970
database multi-site configurations

00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:56,250
language configurations um well the site

00:27:53,970 --> 00:28:01,700
might not be about performance but a

00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:01,700
quick benchmark never hurt anyone right

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,230
depending on the audit obviously

00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:14,490
performance is just a part of the audit

00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:19,670
or it's a main part in acquisition

00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:23,640
audits performance is usually important

00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:26,070
the idea is that the customer your

00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,760
customer the buyer wants to use some

00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:31,980
decide for something bigger better

00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:34,140
something that needs more choose in the

00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:38,610
system so they're going to ask you that

00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:41,280
the site is now serving 100,000 uniques

00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:46,280
a week or 20 thousand registered users

00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,280
can we double that can we triple that

00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:55,380
where's the limit and it's really hard

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,690
to estimate that honestly but you have

00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,700
some idea of that when you do a quick

00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:03,840
benchmark off the side not not a quick

00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:06,140
one but if you benchmark it a bit so

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,140
just

00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:12,960
just run a couple of pages with the

00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:16,860
anonymous users logged in users with the

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:20,120
benchmarking tool profile the site under

00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:23,970
load see how it's doing what it's doing

00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:27,870
especially what it's doing you'll

00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:29,730
probably see potential bottlenecks very

00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:38,190
fast and you'll be able to just write

00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:41,940
them down now it's a really really

00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:44,549
important thing auditing is a

00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:50,690
gentleman's game now for a woman

00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:54,570
obviously but you have to be very polite

00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:58,230
usually you write one or two written

00:29:54,570 --> 00:30:06,809
reports that are kind of their outcome

00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:08,009
of the audit sometimes just one but

00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:09,720
sometimes too if you need a

00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:12,029
non-technical and a technical one

00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:15,389
usually the non-technical is just you

00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:18,000
know for the business people to

00:30:15,389 --> 00:30:21,809
understand something the technical one

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:30,029
is for deciding what to do about the

00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:33,629
site sometimes you can add code snippets

00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:35,370
and runtime grinds from the code but

00:30:33,629 --> 00:30:38,070
sometimes you can't in acquisition

00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:41,850
audits generally speaking you can't add

00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:45,539
any code or any-any anything in there

00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:47,370
because usually the custom parts of the

00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:50,610
site are kind of owned by the company

00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:53,340
still running it and the buyer doesn't

00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:56,490
have any doesn't get any access to them

00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:58,110
even you as doing as you're doing the

00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:00,299
audit you can see the code but your

00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:02,279
customer can see the code they are not

00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:05,460
allowed to see that they can just see

00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:08,070
your opinion so your opinion is what you

00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:11,480
write down not what's happening or

00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:11,480
what's in the code

00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:19,830
this is what I this is what i usually do

00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,840
so i divide audit document into three

00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:24,090
main parts there's the introduction

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,210
explain the system architecture is the

00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:30,090
platform the modules implementation on a

00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:36,810
high level then there's the finding spot

00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:42,290
so I'll list all all things that I think

00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:42,290
are worth mentioning in the document I

00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:52,320
sometimes mention good stuff but mostly

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:57,420
it's very problem focused they tend to

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:59,820
be as coders and then there's the

00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:03,990
improvement suggestion spot where you

00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:06,450
suggest improvements now this is

00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:08,940
debatable if it should be a part of an

00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:10,860
audit but I usually do it as a kind of

00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,960
professional courtesy always to sell

00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:15,060
what I think should be a better solution

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,220
because it's easy to blame some solution

00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:21,660
bad and not give an alternate better

00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:24,630
solution just being kind of you can

00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:27,690
always say that something's bad not tell

00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:30,480
what's better so in that sense I would

00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:33,680
suggest that everybody everyone who's

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:39,290
writing these documents would write also

00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:39,290
your idea of a better way of doing that

00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:45,840
whatever you do don't ever bash don't

00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:48,990
get personal don't bash don't bash the

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:53,130
system don't bash the quarters or the

00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:57,600
decisions just try to try to be as

00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:59,970
neutral as possible even even off the

00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,810
SQL injection hole and the front page

00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:05,400
you have to be neutral if you don't have

00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:10,950
to understand why it was written there

00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:13,470
but there's no need to bash the

00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:16,950
expertise of the original vendor even

00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:18,270
though it might be debated debatable in

00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:22,430
that case if they actually have an

00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:22,430
expertise but still don't write it down

00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:26,470
not only because it doesn't make any

00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,270
difference in the

00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:29,830
end result but also because you'll be at

00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:31,480
the receiving end at some point and

00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:34,120
you'll really appreciate the

00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:37,990
professional courtesy from the auditors

00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:40,240
not bashing you for your really hard and

00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:42,820
fast decisions you have to make that in

00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,650
that fall or that in that spring in that

00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,650
project when we were running out of time

00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:53,200
there are different circumstances when

00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:55,330
we do triple sites and we all know that

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:59,020
some some circumstances are harder than

00:33:55,330 --> 00:34:05,669
others so you will have to just

00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:05,669
understand and we're a small community

00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:20,849
we don't need to get business by bashing

00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:20,849
other people in this community okay

00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:30,950
least only real findings now what if you

00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:33,080
can't find anything wrong with the side

00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:36,530
doesn't it feel kind of sad that you're

00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:38,270
taking six thousand euros of your

00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:41,300
clients money and not even giving him

00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:43,880
anything in return isn't it kind of sad

00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:47,060
maybe you should come up with something

00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:50,260
you should not just write down it

00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,260
there's nothing wrong with the side

00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:56,150
manage the customer expectations when

00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:58,130
you're selling tell them that you might

00:34:56,150 --> 00:35:00,370
not find anything that it might be

00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:04,100
totally fine the site my dad might have

00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:07,490
nothing wrong with it and never exactly

00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:10,640
X I a great problems because when you go

00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:14,930
to that you'll just get into the whole

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:17,360
game of blaming people for like trivial

00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:21,380
problems that can be easily fixed or

00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:25,280
that we're done in a haste and can be

00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:28,880
well rectified in no time or the problem

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:32,260
isn't even that big unfortunately I see

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,520
some of this in the security check

00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:39,970
security audit business they tend to

00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:43,070
list really odd security holes holes

00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:46,640
just to fill up the whole report I don't

00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:49,460
like that we don't have to do that so

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:56,900
let's not if you can't find anything

00:35:49,460 --> 00:36:01,070
don't list anything end of story I just

00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:02,780
did a really big big big audit this

00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:04,460
spring and I couldn't find anything

00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,840
wrong with the system that the only

00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:09,140
thing that was wrong with the system was

00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:11,750
it was built in 2006 and using that x

00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:14,810
technology I told them that it's a it's

00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:17,930
it's like a really beautiful car that's

00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:21,410
a bit dated there's nothing wrong with

00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:23,090
it but it's old and the customer was

00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:24,620
fine with that even those thought that

00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:31,540
was a big audit they shelled out a lot

00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:31,540
of money for that so just real findings

00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:44,280
also don't put your junior devs to do

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:47,160
audits it doesn't end well in the

00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,080
business of an audit the time needed for

00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,760
a job lot it is really really hard to

00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:53,160
estimate you could estimate it well

00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,400
after you're done it when you know what

00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:59,220
the side and tails off that's kind of

00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:03,660
redundant at that point you could also

00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:07,260
just check the clock ranging from two

00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:09,060
man days I would like an hour game with

00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,640
audits isn't something that I would opt

00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:16,410
for I would say that from two man days

00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:19,320
and then you can go on obviously a good

00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:22,050
one a good deal is to get a unlimited

00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:25,950
budget to do that try and try and do

00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:28,790
that probably not that easy to get but

00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:32,130
usually the customer wants something

00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:35,790
some limits some number something and

00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:39,380
then something in return as well pricing

00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:42,210
goes by the hour or whatever but it goes

00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:45,810
by the price of the highest priced

00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:47,609
consultant you have always or should

00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:51,180
also use the highest priced consultant

00:37:47,609 --> 00:37:52,560
you have to do that for support or it's

00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,880
obviously the time is very limited and

00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:58,530
you'll just have to do what you can in

00:37:53,880 --> 00:38:03,839
the limited time then who is the person

00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:06,690
who can do an audit now the person needs

00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:08,930
to be a real expert honestly a real

00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:12,660
expert they have deadly i would say that

00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:15,420
years of experience in not only drupal

00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:20,790
but but rock solid PHP programming

00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:23,910
skills they need to know what they're

00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:25,650
looking for the more experienced they

00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:27,480
are the faster they can find the

00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:31,050
problems and the system they know where

00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,940
they are they know their way around

00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:34,619
different architectures they can

00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:38,460
understand different setups different

00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:40,560
architectures different systems and when

00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,770
doing integrations into external systems

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,810
you'd have to understand

00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:46,780
a lot of about a lot of our integration

00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:51,730
so high performance security

00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:56,380
integrations hugely beneficial i would

00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:58,650
say that for years of experience to

00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,650
start

00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:09,150
okay so you can go to our website and

00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:13,680
see how many references do we have from

00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:15,300
audits not many I can tell you the most

00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,420
problematic party is selling Drupal

00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:22,380
audits is that the customer but would

00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:25,430
want to buy from an experienced I will

00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:28,230
someone who's experienced in audits and

00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:30,839
still they won't give a public reference

00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:32,400
for doing that so they're pissing in

00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:34,800
their own point they can't find anyone

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:40,170
who's done all its publicly because they

00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:42,660
won't allow you to tell that and it's a

00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:45,810
really subtle business because when when

00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:50,160
coming to an audit the ndas get really

00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:54,329
heavy and we've once had to take an

00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:57,060
insurance policy just for signing the

00:39:54,329 --> 00:39:59,430
MDA because the damage causes were so

00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:02,010
steep there are two dangerous that they

00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:04,349
would tip the whole company if if we

00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:06,960
would go to that who didn't obviously

00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:10,920
but but still we had to take in an

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:17,130
insurance policy for that so they really

00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:19,710
get bad some are so bad that small

00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:22,680
triple shops just can't do audit they

00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:24,420
just some audits are the kind of an

00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,670
audit that only go to bigger triple

00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:30,750
shops because they have insurance

00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:33,810
policies or money enough to to sign such

00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:35,490
an NDA they might also redeem and a

00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:39,089
personal NDA from the person doing the

00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:42,480
audit with that with clients as well

00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:44,670
read that if you save you about to sign

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:50,010
one because you really want to know what

00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:53,010
what what it says in the contract so one

00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:55,400
out of 20 audits I've done give all the

00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:58,410
public reference that's about the range

00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,450
so do 20 you get one reference do

00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:01,500
another 20 you get the second one then

00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:06,650
you were experienced you have multiple

00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:06,650
references all right okay

00:41:10,609 --> 00:41:14,970
when when when is the perfect time to

00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:16,740
sell an audit well obviously when the

00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:19,770
customer is changing vendors from

00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:21,000
someone to you you should try and sell

00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:25,200
an audit that's the place where you

00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,630
should dip basically demand it it's for

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:31,200
your own security to know what you're

00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:33,770
getting into and the same goes for

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,970
taking existing sites into your support

00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:44,940
that's also a place where you should

00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:47,339
definitely demand too well to to have

00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:49,080
some conversation for the audit if you

00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:51,180
can't get any conversation then do it on

00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:53,580
your own money out of your own pockets

00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:57,270
you'll have to do it anyway before you

00:41:53,580 --> 00:42:05,869
take someone else's code into your soft

00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:09,770
care and just a reminder selling audits

00:42:05,869 --> 00:42:17,490
never promise you'll find anything wrong

00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:20,760
you don't know that never promise that

00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:26,180
you'll find everything that's wrong you

00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:28,140
can't guarantee that nobody can

00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:35,280
unfortunately you'll probably miss out a

00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:36,810
lot I can guarantee you that and winners

00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,940
in a support audit that will come back

00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:44,190
and bite you in the ass in other words

00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:46,820
maybe not you get a free pass then a

00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:46,820
quick recap

00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:56,290
get the source code all of it you need

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,920
it get the configurations get access to

00:42:56,290 --> 00:43:01,390
production understand the architecture

00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,760
optimized code reading read-only called

00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:10,210
that matters remember the test the

00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:19,230
performance be a gentleman and list only

00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:19,230
real findings okay that's it thank you

00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:30,070
well according the schedule i have got

00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:32,860
15 minutes left so if you have any

00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:35,830
questions please use the microphones or

00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:41,860
i'll have to repeat your question if i

00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:44,950
can when you're doing now and now that

00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:47,970
it's always one person that does it or

00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:51,580
do you sometimes work with a system

00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:53,640
manager that knows more about that field

00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:56,290
okay that's it that's a good question

00:43:53,640 --> 00:44:00,430
obviously the people's expertise differ

00:43:56,290 --> 00:44:03,730
a lot so you might need an expert of a

00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:05,650
certain area to do that so not at all we

00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:07,330
do all or despite by ourselves but

00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:11,610
there's a there's a person who's mainly

00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:14,920
responsible for writing the report so

00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:16,990
small audits yourself maybe especially

00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:19,000
if it's just a regular Drupal sites you

00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:21,310
can you know pretty much all that's

00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,440
needed but when it's a big audit or has

00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:27,010
a lot of different systems around then

00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:31,020
you might want to use other expertise

00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:31,020
you can find in your in your own company

00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:38,230
hi a question about your reports and

00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:40,870
it's not smart to have the findings and

00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:46,840
the solutions together instead of two

00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:53,140
separate sectors well yes this in a way

00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:57,210
but I kind of think that they are not at

00:44:53,140 --> 00:45:00,810
all always one to one so there might be

00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:05,350
three or four findings that can be all

00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:07,780
solved with just one solution so there's

00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:09,880
no connection one to one but it's one

00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:13,870
too many or many to one or many to many

00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:16,950
in the findings and solutions because

00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:19,930
they're not usually that straightforward

00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:23,670
do you do something like Moscow like and

00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:26,350
the most have some shooters for

00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:28,750
recommendations oh I'm so I would

00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:32,140
prioritize the findings and of business

00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:34,870
yeah I usually at least somehow explain

00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:37,840
the severity of the finding or or the

00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:40,510
prior prior mole priority of the fix

00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:43,000
that should be done especially if it's a

00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:44,170
security thing then you usually want to

00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,380
say that this is something that you

00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:49,720
really need to fix with yeah you can you

00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:52,180
can do different kind of prioritization

00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:54,820
or severity listings or say ready

00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:56,770
whatever and you can even categorize

00:45:54,820 --> 00:46:00,520
them by that I actually have done that

00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:05,490
but that like critical findings or
