Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: AUDITING DRUPAL SITES
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	We're doing a lot of audits for Drupal sites. What do we look for when doing an audit? What should your Drupal installation take care of to pass the audit with flying colors? Why are clients contracting us to audit sites and why does that make a difference in what we're looking for?

In this session we'll go through different perspectives for doing Drupal audits. We'll look at the different purposes of an audit and try to show enough case examples for the audience to get a comprehensive view on the whole business of Drupal auditing.

The session will be held by Kalle Varisvirta, Technology Director at Exove and also the main responsible person in doing Drupal audits in the company.
