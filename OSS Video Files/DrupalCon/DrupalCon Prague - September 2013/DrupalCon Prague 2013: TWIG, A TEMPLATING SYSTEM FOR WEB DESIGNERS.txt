Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: TWIG, A TEMPLATING SYSTEM FOR WEB DESIGNERS
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	Twig is yet another templating system written in PHP. But why not using PHP for templates? What makes Twig special?

In this session, I'm going to explain the core philosophy of Twig and its main concepts. You will also learn how to leverage its built-in security features, how to organize your templates, and how to best implement your presentation logic.

My goal: make you realize that PHP is not a templating system anymore and that your current PHP templates are awkward and ugly.
