Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: TAKING THE PLUNGE ... BECOMING A CONTRIBUTOR
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	In this session I will tell the harrowing tale (complete with monsters, romance and a good ol' fashion tar-and-feathering) of how I went from a simple consumer of Drupal to someone who participates and gives back code, time and bad jokes to the community.

I will focus this talk on all the ways you can take that same leap. From creating contrib modules and themes, to writing documentation; From reviewing patches to running a BOF at your local meetup; From writing code for core to being a mentor.

This session is both intended to inspire and give practical advise on how to get started immediately.

I have been the unofficial ambassador for contributing to the Drupal community and graduating from newbie for the New York meetup for the past two years and this session is the culmination of those efforts.

all right I'm gonna get started and if

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,820
people come in then they'll find us even

00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:11,070
meet us halfway through welcome

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,710
everybody this is my talk about taking

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,690
the plunge and becoming a contributor my

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:20,010
name is alex ross i'm a senior architect

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:21,810
at nbcuniversal and on the various

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,869
channels on the internet I'm blean or

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:27,779
glean 18 so you can find me an old all

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:29,519
the various places I tend to talk really

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,660
loud so if it gets too loud because of

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,579
the speakers let me know and I'll move

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:37,520
the mic I can't tell how that it is back

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:40,489
there or if you can't hear me at all so

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,840
basically before I got started

00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:45,210
contributing I was doing what most

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,399
people are doing and using Drupal and

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,890
getting what I can out of it not doing

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,690
anything to kind of contribute back to

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,610
the community i was using bunch of

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,020
modules i was using a base theme i was

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,399
doing all these things I would you know

00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,530
search around when I had questions or

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:04,439
problems but I was never doing anything

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:07,530
kind of to get back so like most people

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,030
it started when I found a bug right

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,080
that's usually the first place that

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,850
people end up contributing and you know

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,430
I submitted a bug report I tried to fix

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,060
it that didn't go so well I talked to a

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,830
couple people in the community and you

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,330
know eventually I got to the point where

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,100
I was able to get some help and get some

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,890
guidance from some of the community

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,979
community members who around at the time

00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:33,659
and I finally got a fix in place and I

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,670
submitted a patch and it was accepted

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,460
into Drupal core and I was very exciting

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,140
and actually this is the comment from

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,520
that original post so I don't know if

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,979
you can read it but I was very excited

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,509
about my first patch getting in and web

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,649
chick was threatening to go get jell-o

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,520
and feathers and then whistles

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:53,430
innocently so yeah this was about four

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,219
five four years ago and since then I've

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,590
become the maintainer of about a dozen

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,680
modules on drupal.org I've contributed

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,820
patches back to core into a bunch of

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,110
controls and

00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,180
written documentation I've submitted

00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,440
bugs I've submitted feature requests

00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,100
I've answered questions I've been a

00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,900
mentor of Don trainings I've started

00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:17,350
kind of Mentor e-type activities at the

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,520
local drupal user group in New York so

00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,660
I've done all of these things and I

00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,220
figured this was a good opportunity to

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,020
talk about those things and talk about

00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,420
how you can kind of get back to Drupal

00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,820
community and and get involved so I'm

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:31,690
going to get started with how you can

00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:33,430
contribute so these are some of the ways

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,720
is not all the ways but they're most of

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,430
them that you can actually give back to

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,500
Drupal community and become a more

00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,570
active member become a contributor and

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,640
I'm going to be going over each of you

00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:44,560
is in pretty good detail some of them

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,880
are much easier to explain and talk

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,020
about than others but it doesn't

00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,690
necessarily mean they're easier to do

00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,250
but as we go through you'll see what I'm

00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,410
talking about so the most common way

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,300
that people think of when they're

00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,060
talking about contributing to Drupal is

00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,030
just by you know writing a bit of code

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,470
making a patch fixing a bug creating a

00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,360
new feature submitting that patch back

00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,230
to the control module or to juba org so

00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,060
we're going to talk about that we're

00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:10,060
actually gonna do it by the end of the

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:15,010
presentation writing and maintaining

00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:17,080
your own control some contribs I'll and

00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,650
very easy to maintain some of them are

00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:23,680
panels right huge complex beasts that

00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:26,769
require you know 10 people to kind of

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,700
really get together and deal with so

00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:29,260
we're going to talk about how you can

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,989
actually go about contributing your

00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,209
module and your code back to core back

00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:36,000
to the community rather we're going to

00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:39,820
talk about how to review patches right

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,340
if you come across a patch that hey it's

00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,019
been useful for you talk about that go

00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,820
back on the issue and say hey I use this

00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:47,019
patch it worked for me or I use this

00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,420
patch and it totally screwed up

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,590
everything and you should never use it

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,420
both of those pieces of information are

00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,340
equally important to the person who's

00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:57,220
either maintaining the module or the

00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,900
core maintainer if the patch works

00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,070
that's great information if it doesn't

00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,750
work that means that there's more work

00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,090
to be done but now we have another Pinot

00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,739
another data point to work off of

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,660
mentoring someone right this is a great

00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:09,130
way to contribute to the community on

00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,980
friday and i'll talk about this a little

00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,329
more there's a whole big sprint for for

00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,010
newbies and people who are just getting

00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:16,400
started contributing and there will be a

00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,750
whole bunch of people in

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,000
don't know what color t-shirt is yet

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,799
because I picked it up but in a hour

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,810
yellow t-shirt who will be there

00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:25,820
mentoring others and helping you get

00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,509
started as a contributor in one way or

00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:31,880
another triaging issues all right not

00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:34,729
the most sexy of contribution as you can

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,320
you can do here but very very important

00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:38,810
there are hundreds of new issues on

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,539
drupal.org every day and some of them

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,070
are duplicates some of them are

00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:47,090
triplicates somewhere there mark you

00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:49,100
know are totally in the wrong project

00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,600
and just need to be moved some of them

00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,669
need to be confirmed and so on so we're

00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,289
going to talk about that submitting a

00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:56,419
bug report in a feature request right

00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:58,310
how do we actually do that properly and

00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:00,350
by properly I don't mean what form do

00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,539
you go to I mean there are kind of right

00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,130
ways and wrong ways I'll talk about for

00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:06,740
example why it's not a good idea to

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:09,080
submit a bug report by saying wow your

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,849
code is broken you guys suck why haven't

00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,970
you fixed it yet right things of that

00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:15,860
nature and then something is as

00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,630
straightforward as summarizing an issue

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,849
hugely important there's been an

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,740
initiative for a couple year and a half

00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:22,870
now to start going through and

00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,940
summarizing issues on drupal.org

00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:28,580
especially for core some of those issues

00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:31,099
can get really long and nasty to try and

00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,510
figure out and try and groc so just you

00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:34,550
know contributing that way can be a

00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,470
great way to get started and then

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,639
finally writing documentation everybody

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,050
always talks about document everything

00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:40,220
document everything and that's true we

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,530
want to document everything but there

00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,430
are again you know different ways of

00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,590
doing that within the Drupal community

00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,699
and each of them are valid in their own

00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,280
way and we're going to talk about kind

00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:52,340
of how how you can go about contributing

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,139
by writing documentation so that's what

00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,520
we're going to talk about we're going to

00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:57,139
start with writing documentation you

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,810
basically go in order of ease of

00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:01,970
explanation not an ease of doing which I

00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,650
mentioned before so writing

00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,900
documentation the first thing I like to

00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,789
remind people whatever form your

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,370
documentation takes and wherever you're

00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:12,110
writing it and we'll talk about those

00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,659
always assume that whatever code you're

00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,949
writing documentation for is or whatever

00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:17,900
whatever process you're writing

00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:19,820
documentation for assume you're going to

00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,220
need to do it again in about two years

00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,830
when you're drunk if you assume those

00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,479
things right then you will always write

00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,760
good documentation because you will

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,770
always need to

00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,020
you know you'll always kind of picture

00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,640
it as as though you're going through

00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,320
this again for the first time because

00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,880
nobody can look at code two years later

00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,680
when they're drunk and understand what

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,040
in the world they were doing with it

00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:45,070
without good documentation so on

00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,440
drupal.org there's a good amount of

00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:49,000
documentation up there and we're gonna

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,670
go take a look at that and actually you

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,470
know play around with it a little bit if

00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,360
you're following along with

00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:58,360
documentation on drupal.org and you see

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,740
something wrong fix it right there right

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,170
then if you see something needs

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,450
clarification fix it right there right

00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:06,220
then if you get into the habit of doing

00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,360
that over time if everybody gets in the

00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,510
habit of doing that over time the

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,370
documentation on drupal.org and in other

00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:16,780
places which we'll talk about is going

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:18,430
to get better and better so another

00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,320
point that I like to bring up if there's

00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,990
no documentation already for the thing

00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,390
you were doing whatever that thing is

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:27,370
write it down as you go right if you can

00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,930
take out an old fashioned pen and piece

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,150
of paper believe it or not they still

00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,860
work but write it down as you go these

00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,990
are the steps I took this is what I

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,760
clicked on this is what I this is the

00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,920
wrong path I went down right those are

00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,180
good for parenthetical saying don't do

00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,490
this even though you may think you

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,080
should all that is really good

00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,900
information and if you can add it to the

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,070
documentation that's going to be hugely

00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,530
helpful to the next person that comes

00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,970
along and don't forget that next person

00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,640
might be you in two years when you're

00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:56,020
drunk so let's do that real quick I

00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,970
don't know if the internet is working

00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:01,470
right now so I have Eclipse have a

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:04,570
back-up plan if it isn't did it uh

00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:07,840
where'd that link go and won't let me

00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:11,940
click on my link oh well um so I'll

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,840
bring up my backup plan here so

00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,550
documentation there are a couple ways to

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,290
document what's going on there's

00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,420
documentation in code right if you're

00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,920
actually sitting in writing code

00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,450
document your code right wherever you're

00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,680
doing it there's documentation on

00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,970
drupal.org which is what we're going to

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,610
talk about mostly right now and there's

00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:29,200
documentation that can happen in your in

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,600
your blog right on your personal site

00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,620
where ever so documentation on

00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,760
drupal.org if you come here close that

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,020
there's documentation link right up at

00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,060
the top bring through a page just like

00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:43,390
this and if you click around one of the

00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:45,160
areas that the documentation breaks it

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,180
down into and you might be in all

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,740
likelihood you'll get to one of these

00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,750
pages based on a google search anyway

00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,460
but if you get to one of these pages for

00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,980
example working with nodes and content

00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:56,230
types right and you see something that

00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,120
is incorrect right you as long as you

00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:01,300
log in to juba org you can edit it right

00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:04,420
away right here there is no requirement

00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,190
to you know that permission to edit the

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:09,220
documentation all you need is drupal.org

00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:11,410
account that's it so log in head into

00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,270
here say hey this documentation is only

00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:15,250
appropriate for Drupal 7 or it's a

00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,720
beginner or all this good stuff and then

00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,450
there's the actual documentation at the

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,520
bottom very often as I'm going through a

00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,440
process i have this page open in another

00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,880
tab and i just go through and i write my

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:31,839
documentation hugely important ok so

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:35,140
that is documentation i'm going to keep

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,540
going so the next thing i want to talk

00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,010
about is summarizing issues all right

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,230
like i said there's been an initiative

00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:43,540
for for a little while now for

00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,670
summarizing issues again all you need to

00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,380
do this is a drupal.org account so it's

00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:50,110
that there's a pretty low barrier to

00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,400
entry in terms of getting involved when

00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:53,530
you're summarizing an issue we want to

00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,980
summarize everything in that issue right

00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:58,480
this is a deceptively simple process you

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,130
know people think Oh summarizing issue i

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,990
have two free minutes i can go and

00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:04,030
summarize that issue it almost never

00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:07,240
takes that long it almost always takes

00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:09,750
you know half an hour or longer because

00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,280
what you need to do is really understand

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,600
you know the entirety of the issue and

00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,880
if the issue is at a point where it

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,740
means summary chances are there's a lot

00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,390
going on so let's take a quick look at

00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:25,420
at an example of why this is really

00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:26,920
useful there was an issue in 2008 that I

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,780
remembered very vividly and I'm going to

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,880
bring that up this issue if i scroll

00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:33,360
down long enough has i'm not gonna go

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,120
down it has about 600 it's 500 comments

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,670
and it was about it is it is a really

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,370
really horrible annoying ie ie bug I

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:44,380
know naive ugh where you can't have more

00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:47,140
than 31 style sheets on a page it'll

00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,880
just ignore the 32nd and on like you

00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,920
won't tell you won't throw an error just

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,320
ignores it and suddenly you add one more

00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,590
module and your entire

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,790
explodes for no good reason so we needed

00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,900
to figure out a way to deal with it I'm

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,600
not gonna go into the details of how we

00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,730
did but looking through these comments

00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:07,790
if you were to come into this

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:11,190
conversation on I don't know let's say

00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:12,540
January 6 2010 and someone was going to

00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,010
say to you hey what's going on that

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,230
issue do you know how to fix the problem

00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,730
there is no way you would be able to

00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,620
figure out what in the world was going

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,030
on and if we scroll all the way back up

00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,580
and I'm not going to scroll I will use

00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:26,790
my little magic scroll bar here um all

00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:29,550
that's really in here is hey IE breaks

00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,320
when you add you know 31 more than 31

00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:34,200
style sheets here's a link to Microsoft

00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,700
that's it right so grokking this issue 2

00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,320
in it this is why I remember it so it

00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,060
took me like a day and a half to really

00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,980
understand that the the path people were

00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,840
taking because a lot of people were

00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,760
arguing back and forth so an issue

00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,620
summary right this is why they're so

00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,910
important it would be it was nearly

00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,960
impossible to figure out what's going on

00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:54,300
here so here's an example of a more

00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,240
recent issue from last year end of last

00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,260
year where they did go through and and I

00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,030
don't know whether this was the person

00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,470
who initially open the issue or this is

00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,730
someone who went back and did it but

00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,770
they actually went through and they did

00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,690
an issue summary for this and just to

00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:09,120
give you an idea of how much easier this

00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:12,840
makes life what's the problem okay when

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,880
you use the ckeditor in Drupal 8 there's

00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:18,050
no accessible way to move around the

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,400
buttons that's really the issue and

00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:22,050
here's some screenshots that show hey

00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,130
look no toolbar I can't move around the

00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,960
button that's a problem for

00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:27,770
accessibility what's the proposed

00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,420
resolution hey we need a drag-and-drop

00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:32,160
click you are the drag-and-drop click

00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,170
you I should be driven from an HTML form

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,000
which underlies it so that you know

00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,220
someone using accessibility software can

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,170
can take advantage of the form instead

00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,330
of the actual drag name dropping okay

00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:44,040
there's a proposed resolution what tasks

00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,990
are remaining determined solid

00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,440
implementation and so on so the key

00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:51,050
points here are raining tasks up where

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,030
we have the problem proposed resolution

00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:55,920
remaining tasks whether there's any user

00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,840
interface changes or API changes and

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,520
then the original post we always like to

00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,990
keep the original post so that when the

00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,790
person who really posted it comes back

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,470
later and says ah this wasn't the issue

00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,100
i was talking about we can refer back

00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,610
and

00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:11,160
figure out what went on there so hugely

00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:12,660
important to do these and I don't know

00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,790
if this is the right one yes there is

00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:18,410
even a node on drupal.org which has a

00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,410
template for these issues summaries yes

00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,990
sure it's definitely until the question

00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,300
was this is relevant for clothes tickets

00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:28,620
I would argue that in the perfect world

00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,580
it would already have been summarized

00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:34,320
before it was closed but in reality if a

00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,850
ticket does get close an issue you know

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,370
for whatever reason why the weather was

00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,780
nonsensical or just you know the

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,360
community decided to go away and go out

00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:45,360
another way or it got pulled in it's

00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,070
really definitely useful to have that

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,440
summary in there but ideally it'd be

00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:51,180
there in there ahead of time some issues

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,650
are so small and so straightforward that

00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,530
the net summary just never happens for

00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:59,070
them but in those cases you know that's

00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:02,030
fine okay so that's that's basic you

00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:09,120
know image image issue summaries and

00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:10,770
let's go back to this guy so I showed

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,500
you an example of why this is useful and

00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:15,090
how this is done well again these can

00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,040
take a long time because grokking that

00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:18,660
issue could take you quite a while but

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,950
once you've done it it makes the lives

00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,620
of the people who are actually doing the

00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:25,860
code and that might be you also a lot

00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,900
easier on and finally that's the link to

00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,910
to the standards that have been kind of

00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,350
set up so that you can just copy and

00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:34,680
paste a template and start adding the

00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:36,660
summary the next thing and in my opinion

00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,270
this is absolutely a way of being a

00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,710
contributor to drupal and it's for most

00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:43,320
people it's the the first way they

00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:45,090
contribute to an open source project my

00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,840
project stopped working I don't know why

00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:51,120
right I file a support ticket file a bug

00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:53,640
these things are you know they're very

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,870
valuable if nobody ever files the bug if

00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,300
everyone assumes that someone else is

00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:00,300
going to file the bug then don't you

00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:02,880
know get fixed so huge huge value for

00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,680
everybody but a couple things to keep in

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,270
mind when you're when you're you know

00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,160
submitting a bug report is always ask

00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:11,360
yourself is this a bug report or is this

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,820
a support request right there's a very

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,490
grayish line when people are deciding

00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,720
that a bug report a good rule of thumb

00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,819
to keep in mind

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,339
where the bug report is if you are in

00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:26,250
let's say it's Drupal 7 and the views

00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:28,500
module start with a vanilla install of

00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:32,519
Drupal 7 with just the views module and

00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:34,019
see if you can can you know still Rick

00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:36,420
reproduced replicate the issue that

00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,829
you're seeing and if you can doesn't

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,959
necessarily mean it but chances are this

00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:44,490
as a bug report this is a bug and you're

00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:47,160
going to file it that way but if what

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:49,319
you're asking is really hey how do I do

00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,180
this that's not a bug report that's

00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:53,639
support request if it's hey it would be

00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,199
great if your module also did X that's

00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,360
not a bugger crap yeah bug report that's

00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,060
a feature request so categorizing those

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:04,800
well helps the maintainer of the module

00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:07,769
or core figure you'll help you basically

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,000
be as detail as possible you know if you

00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:10,889
can do an issue summary right at the

00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,120
beginning that's great we will everyone

00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:14,459
will always go back and refine those

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,050
issues summaries as we go but you know

00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:17,490
definitely worth taking the time and

00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:22,410
trying to start out with an issue

00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:24,000
summary finally don't be angry the worst

00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,050
possible thing you can do in you submit

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,689
a bug report and I kind of mentioned

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,790
this earlier is say your code sucks fix

00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:31,110
it right no one wants to help out with

00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,370
that especially people who are working

00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:35,309
in an open source project and

00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:37,740
volunteering their time to do so so be

00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:39,120
be respectful of the people who are

00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,629
going to be helping you out and helping

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,009
you know you get your problem solved so

00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:46,470
let's go ahead and just take a quick

00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:53,959
look at the way to submit a bug report

00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:53,959
on drupal.org what did I miss it no yes

00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:00,660
so writing tests is it is your question

00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:03,480
like should we write tests yes the

00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:06,689
answer that question is is yes I mean

00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,100
Drupal core takes a lot of time and

00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:09,689
effort to make sure that pretty much

00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,929
everything that goes into core has tests

00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:16,189
attached to it not every contribs but

00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:18,510
most do no I wouldn't say most many do

00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:20,159
it's definitely good practice and it's

00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,929
going to prevent the bugs from yeah

00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:25,589
obviously from resurfacing later on or

00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:28,620
at least help prevent that so very

00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:35,250
quickly I'm just going to go to

00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:37,110
no use and if you need to add a feature

00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,309
request or a bug report one thing to

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,110
just keep in mind the first thing they

00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:42,780
have at the top here is a search box

00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:44,520
this is so that we don't submit

00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,750
duplicates as much as possible the first

00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,100
thing you should do before submitting a

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,780
bug report is search around and see if

00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,160
somebody's already done it maybe there's

00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,600
a fix already maybe the patch has

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,680
already been included and you just need

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,110
to update to the latest version of

00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,180
module but if not you're going to open

00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:00,059
the issues right here here all open

00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:05,640
issues and then not logged in i'm going

00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:07,230
to log in real quick I always get

00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,760
nervous I don't forget to tab during a

00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:13,020
presentation everyone's don't see my

00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:14,880
password and then submitting issue is

00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,460
fairly straightforward what version of

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,140
the module are you using is this part of

00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,170
a specific component not every module

00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,940
has such detailed components most of

00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,170
them have just kind of its code or its

00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,620
documentation or it's something like

00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:30,809
that bug report task feature request

00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,790
support task is kind of the amorphous

00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:35,960
catch-all I don't know which one of

00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:39,510
these is i'll choose task and then

00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,040
priority who's a sign usually you can

00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,570
only pick yourself unless you are the

00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,059
maintainer the module and then finally

00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,860
what's the status of this right this

00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:48,900
will go back and forth 25 times during

00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,730
the course of an issue between being

00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,440
reviewed and tested or being needs work

00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,900
or there's a patch or I'm not going to

00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,250
fix it things of that nature and then

00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,170
just be as detailed as you can in your

00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:05,090
description over here alright pretty

00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:07,710
straightforward so let's keep going I

00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:09,570
don't like keynote have decided so yeah

00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:14,510
so I'm a new dad so I have gratuitously

00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:14,510
cute photos with my kid yeah

00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:19,019
I've had issues where I've submitted

00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:20,940
patches to things and either the motion

00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:23,850
seems to be dead or no one looks at it

00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,409
and have this patch stating that but it

00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,519
doesn't seem to be getting it was paying

00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:28,710
attention to what would you recommend

00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:30,779
doing that so in that in that situation

00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,919
so the question was basically hey maybe

00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:33,690
there's a patch sitting in an issue for

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,359
for a really long time and nobody's

00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,970
nobody's updating it nobody's looking at

00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:40,409
it what do you do in that situation

00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,509
typically what i would do there is um

00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:43,590
you know leave a comment say hey has

00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:45,419
there been any updates to this issue

00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:48,029
give people a reasonable amount of time

00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:51,299
to respond to that and if nobody does I

00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:53,609
may go on IRC and see if the maintainer

00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:55,529
is in IRC and ask them hey you know has

00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:59,039
anyone looked at this issue but again I

00:19:55,529 --> 00:20:01,350
don't go into IRC and say hey you have

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,119
to fix this issue right it's breaking my

00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,499
site that's it's just never going to get

00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,989
done that way and people are never going

00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:09,200
to kind of respond to you that way at

00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:11,789
the end of the day if nobody responds

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,869
there's a couple options you can you

00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:15,840
know if you want to take over

00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:17,340
responsibility of that module that's

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,929
that's something you can request by

00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,249
opening an issue in that module saying

00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:23,100
hey it doesn't look like anyone's being

00:20:20,249 --> 00:20:25,440
very responsive see this issue where no

00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,879
one's responding I'd like to become a

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,799
maintainer or a co maintainer of this

00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:31,470
module maybe move things along that's

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,879
absolutely totally you know a reasonable

00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:36,989
thing to request if you feel comfortable

00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:39,570
with that and then failing that you know

00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:40,859
patch the module and you have a module

00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:43,080
that you've patched and you have to

00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:49,619
unfortunately keep track of that as you

00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:52,769
go okay triaging triaging issues so one

00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:55,289
question that a lot of the core maintain

00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:56,940
errs in particular have whenever new

00:20:55,289 --> 00:21:00,210
issues pop up but this is also true for

00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,499
contribute maintain errs is hey I see

00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,909
there's a new issue that someone put up

00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:05,460
there today wasn't didn't I see that

00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:07,379
issue 3 days ago or three weeks ago or

00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,489
three years ago and wasn't that related

00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:09,989
to something else and isn't that a

00:21:08,489 --> 00:21:13,440
duplicate and I don't remember what's

00:21:09,989 --> 00:21:16,019
going on and they can certainly take the

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,519
time and start looking through all of

00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:18,929
the issues and see if they can't find

00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:20,489
the related one if they happen to know

00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:22,830
the one right then and there that's

00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:25,260
terrific but if not you take someone

00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:27,960
like you know like Tim Plunkett who's

00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:30,330
mitting you know 400 commits to juba

00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,310
core every couple days I'd rather he

00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:34,550
spent his time working on core than

00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:36,540
searching through the issue queue and

00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:39,330
and figuring out whether that's a

00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:43,110
duplicate or not so triaging issues

00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:45,000
helped out a lot a couple things to keep

00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,680
in mind when you do it is can you

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,390
confirm the issue right if someone

00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,850
that's a bug report and says hey it

00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:53,070
doesn't work when I click you know the

00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:55,290
food button I thought it was supposed to

00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,910
do something try it right install that

00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:59,310
you know drupal triple 8 on your local

00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:01,050
machine and give it a shot if you can

00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:03,390
confirm it great comment on that issue

00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:04,980
saying I can confirm this right if you

00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,870
can't confirm it's a comment on an issue

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,610
and say I can't reproduce this right

00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:13,110
both of those pieces of information are

00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:15,480
equally valuable and there's a link on

00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:19,680
drupal.org that makes it a lot easier to

00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:21,990
kind of participate this way and I am if

00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,310
you go to your dashboard obviously have

00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,860
to be logged in for this if you go to

00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:28,800
your dashboard you have this add a block

00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,270
right here and if you add a block one of

00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,790
the box you can add is called

00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:34,560
contributor links right here and this is

00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:37,080
incredibly useful for a lot of stuff if

00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,720
you're going to be contributing the the

00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:42,150
Q's right here are particularly valuable

00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,590
for Drupal core development but they

00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:46,800
also include some you know the

00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:48,570
contributors many of them do at least

00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,160
but this one right here is issues

00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:53,190
needing triage if you actually go there

00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:57,360
it's it's the same list of all of the

00:22:53,190 --> 00:23:00,090
issues that are open for drupal org on

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,610
drupal.org i should say but it's one

00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:05,790
it's sorted by replies right where zero

00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:08,370
is on top so every one of these issues

00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,960
on here have 0 replies which means no

00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:11,370
one has looked at them or no one has

00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,130
looked at them and felt it necessary to

00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:17,840
comment on them if you scroll down and

00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:21,060
we go to the ninth page there is still

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:24,150
not one with a reply if you go to the

00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:26,250
13th page there is still not one with a

00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:28,230
reply I believe I looked the other day I

00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,910
think it was 16 where we started to

00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:32,040
actually get reply yeah ones with one

00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:34,920
reply so that means if there's somewhere

00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,900
between 13 and 16 pages of issues that

00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,550
have never really been looked at and

00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,200
some of them might be really

00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:42,450
critical in person you know putting the

00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,700
issue in to the issue queue just wasn't

00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:46,710
aware that how critical it was some of

00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,810
them could be you know killed right away

00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:51,810
oh this is a duplicate we fixed this

00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:55,110
last week that sort of a thing so now

00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:58,260
triaging issues is as easy in terms of

00:23:55,110 --> 00:24:00,360
kind of the process as picking one right

00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:03,510
hey the update hook help for comment

00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:06,270
module alright there's an issue that's a

00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:09,600
task for Drupal core and you know it was

00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:11,100
opened by I frick and here's a quick

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,390
background hey this this issue is part

00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,210
of a meta task I'm gonna talk about meta

00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:18,090
tasks I'm Metta issues in a minute and

00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:21,480
we need to you know review the the hook

00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:25,170
help for what module is this a comment

00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,550
module okay this isn't a bug so it's not

00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:29,660
to say whether or not this is

00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:32,100
reproducible right that's not a valid

00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,780
way to triage this particular issue but

00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:37,290
it's totally valid to sit here and say

00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:40,290
oh somebody already did this right that

00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:42,360
happens from time to time or you know

00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:44,430
this is something that's probably good

00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,630
you might want to tag this as novice if

00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:47,940
it hasn't been tagged that way already

00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:50,730
if we feel that this is something that

00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,890
somebody who's new could handle just

00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:54,510
that simple act makes it much easier for

00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,790
someone who's coming into the community

00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,780
to say alright I want to try something I

00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,820
want to get I want to figure something

00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:02,970
out I'll look at these novice issues and

00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:05,190
again obvious issues if you go to your

00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:09,120
contributor links there's a nice there

00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:11,310
it is obvious issues like um you know so

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,320
you know simply by the act of triaging

00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:16,830
these issues were really kind of setting

00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:19,080
the table for people who want to do code

00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:21,750
contributions or review code or write

00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,700
documentation within the code things of

00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:26,690
that nature that might be you that might

00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:29,160
not be you right this is not necessarily

00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:30,960
you know this idea being a contributor

00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,760
is not necessarily just for people who

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,920
write code it's not just for developers

00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,470
everybody in this room can you know

00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,680
accomplish some of these tasks very few

00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:44,400
people can accomplish all of these tasks

00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:46,500
so bear that in mind okay let's keep

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:53,550
going

00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:55,910
due to do um mentoring so I year and a

00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:58,080
half two years ago maybe not that long

00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:59,550
and there's an initiative that was

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,340
started by a couple of members of the

00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:03,570
Drupal community for for mentoring new

00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,310
folks who are coming into the community

00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:07,320
people who are trying to kind of take

00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:09,240
the step from going from you know I'm

00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,880
really novice at this too I want to be a

00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,530
little bit more involved and how do we

00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,510
kind of climb the ladder everybody's I

00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:17,760
hope everybody at this point is either

00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:19,650
seen that that ridiculous cartoon about

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,000
the Drupal learning curve right where

00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,620
you climb up the cliff and likely just

00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,780
keep going skin it starts to come around

00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,580
this way the Drupal learning curve is

00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,630
that daunting right for those of you who

00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,270
have been in the community for a little

00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:32,100
while you may kind of already have

00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:33,450
gotten over some of that but for those

00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,240
people who are coming in the first time

00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:39,150
it can be a big challenge so having

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,970
people who are there regularly helps

00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:44,490
considerably so mentoring there's a

00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:46,290
couple things you can do to mentor it's

00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,580
not that you know it's not just the

00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,200
Drupal mentoring program which i'm going

00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,480
to show you that site in just a second

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,400
you can go right on IRC and answer

00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:58,620
questions right that is mentoring

00:26:53,400 --> 00:27:00,390
there's no there's no you know what's

00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,130
the word I'm looking for there's no

00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,720
formal process that you have to go

00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:06,240
through in order to mentor someone if

00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,880
you spend ten minutes you know in your

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,380
afternoon or something in Drupal or

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,230
drupal support or something like that in

00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,520
IRC then you're helping someone out you

00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,720
answered that one or two questions

00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,120
that's great you're helping that person

00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,530
get to the next level if you don't know

00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,600
about IRC you're going to how to get on

00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:23,670
IRC there's a great page on Drupal 8 or

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,890
Drupal it'll work / IRC which kind of

00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:29,430
explains how to get on there and what to

00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:31,950
do again when you're on IRC be nice

00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:34,230
right and it pains me that I have to

00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,640
like kind of repeat that at every camp

00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:38,400
that I go to and I give a talk like this

00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,600
or every conference but you'd be amazed

00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,490
some people come on and they're just

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,900
nasty and there's no reason for it and

00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,270
you're just not going to get you know

00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:47,580
good responses if you're not kind to

00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:49,020
other people another thing that you can

00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:52,440
do we've done this in the New York group

00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:54,660
we started a new be buff right so at

00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,670
every New York meetup which is once a

00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,990
month we have somebody from the

00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:59,180
community who is fairly senior in the

00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:01,030
community go to

00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:03,350
separate room off to the side and just

00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:05,480
they started a new be buff so anyone

00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:07,370
who's there at that drupal meetup who is

00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,010
either new to drupal doesn't understand

00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:11,780
exactly what Drupal is or they're there

00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,310
because they have a very specific

00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:15,290
question and it's not really appropriate

00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:17,870
in a room full of 75 people to be like

00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:20,990
on my site i get this error but only on

00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:21,830
tuesdays that sort of a thing you know

00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,810
could be a little bit of a challenge

00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:25,670
with that many people in the room so we

00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:27,260
do that movie buff great way to help

00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:29,330
mentor people great way to help move

00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:31,580
people up from being you know brand new

00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:33,230
to this to I'm a novice I'm a novice who

00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,540
I'm kind of at that intermediate step

00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:37,490
and we definitely have people who now

00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:40,220
run the new be buff who were in the new

00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:41,420
bit off at one point and that's you know

00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,750
that makes us feel all warm and fuzzy

00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:45,860
inside so that's a great thing to do

00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,690
Jubal mentoring so I said I talked about

00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,570
this little earlier on Drupal bantering

00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:52,640
is a great site that we're set up by by

00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:55,820
Jess and Cathy and Andrea and a couple

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:59,660
other people I think and Tim Plunkett

00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:00,860
yeah basically the idea is that people

00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,380
who are a little more senior in the

00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:05,750
community are going through and taking

00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:07,820
note of issues that are appropriate for

00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,350
people who are at various levels of

00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:11,270
getting started in the community and

00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:13,160
they flag them as such and they break

00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:15,890
them down into very you know specific

00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:18,590
tasks and and then they have office

00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:21,680
hours in IRC two or three times a week

00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:23,780
depending on what's going on and if you

00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,700
come into the office hours and say hey I

00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:27,530
want to help I do not know how to get

00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,940
started someone that will be there

00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,860
during those designated times that is

00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,870
very specifically there to respond to a

00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,460
person exactly like that and they'll

00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:36,650
point you to Drupal mentoring org and

00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,840
they'll help you assign you know a task

00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:41,570
to yourself and those tasks can be as

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,850
simple as triaging issues or as simple

00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:46,910
as summarizing an issue or as complex as

00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:49,310
you know right this hook for Drupal 8 um

00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:51,260
you know they kind of span the range of

00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:53,960
all the things that you might be

00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:56,240
interested in doing so that's a terrific

00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:58,190
way of getting involved for the people

00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,480
who want to become contributors and it's

00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:01,070
a typical way to get involved for those

00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,450
of you who already feel like you're a

00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:05,240
little bit more senior and you want to

00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:06,620
help others become a contributor that's

00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,980
a terrific way to do it so i highly

00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:13,840
recommend doing that Friday this Friday

00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:16,490
there is a kind of mentoring day

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,020
mentoring sprint where the mentors will

00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:20,450
be around in their yellow t-shirts so

00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:25,250
come to that if you want to be a mentor

00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:27,230
talk to Kathy um and you know it's it's

00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,670
really you know terrific to help out the

00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:31,820
people who are just getting started on

00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:32,690
Friday ok the next thing you can do it

00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,490
now we're going to start to get a little

00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:36,770
bit more into code so for those of you

00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:38,000
who aren't coders a lot of the stuff

00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:39,560
that you can kind of do to contribute

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,030
we've covered for those of you who are

00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,430
writing code this is where we're going

00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:44,570
to start to get into that a little bit

00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:47,960
so reviewing a patch there's a couple

00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:51,470
ways that you can review a patch first

00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:54,070
is reviewing a patch for style gotchas

00:30:51,470 --> 00:31:00,290
and strategy now what I mean by this is

00:30:54,070 --> 00:31:03,530
let's just do it let's go there so do

00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:10,130
you do that I miss it no there's um if I

00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:12,050
go to I think it's this one yes no there

00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,950
we go okay so this is a module that I'm

00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,600
a maintainer of it's called

00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:15,860
representative image it's a great module

00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,080
it's terrific you should definitely

00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:20,150
download it try it out it helps you with

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,130
that problem of hey my content type is

00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:23,600
12 different image fields and I want a

00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,190
view but I want to pick which image

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,260
field is the representative image for

00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,670
that content type so that that's all the

00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:31,370
one that always shows up anyway um

00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:34,970
that's me plug-in module so if you come

00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:36,860
to an issue where you have a patch like

00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:39,050
this right I can click on this patch and

00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,820
I can actually start looking through

00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:43,850
this patch it's a little bit harder to

00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:45,230
see on on the on the board here but I

00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:47,390
can start looking through this patch and

00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:48,890
saying oh okay you'll have to take my

00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:50,870
word for it that these are pluses on the

00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:53,480
side and there are some minuses down

00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:55,690
here oh this person is adding this bit

00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,670
of code and taking away this bit of code

00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:01,010
from the style point of view hey they're

00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:02,720
not using Drupal coding standards I

00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:04,460
don't need to apply this patch to my

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,690
code to know that I can look at it you

00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,880
know once i'm more familiar with that i

00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:09,320
can look at it and say oh you you know

00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,120
you're supposed to have a comma at the

00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,280
end of you know the last thing in an

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,920
array you don't have that and i can

00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,840
comment on that i can look at this and

00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,620
say from it from a strategic point of

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,929
view why are you

00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:26,240
you're using a function in here from the

00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:28,519
views module but there's no dependency

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,230
on the views module well that's

00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:31,549
strategically a bad idea because someone

00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:33,470
might install this module the

00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:35,509
representative image module but not have

00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:37,460
views installed and then this will

00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:39,110
explode right I don't need to actually

00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,679
install this to figure that out I can

00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:45,889
just know the other thing that you know

00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:48,289
you might see our hey you know this

00:32:45,889 --> 00:32:50,360
needs tests right and you might just

00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:52,190
comment in the issue hey this is a great

00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,389
patch as far as I can tell so far but

00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:55,820
there's no tests and this definitely

00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:57,080
needs tests because you're fixing an

00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:00,230
error and almost always when you're

00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,210
fixing our unique tests this is a kind

00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:04,549
of a crappy way to look at these if you

00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:07,309
if you know even even if you could see

00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:09,320
the pluses and minuses so um somebody

00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:10,820
came up with i think was sun and someone

00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,629
else came up with a tool that i'm going

00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:19,639
to show you to make this way more better

00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:21,620
in terms of reviewing so now that i have

00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:24,950
some internets hopefully you still

00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,419
haven't I was in incognito mode over

00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:27,590
there so that you didn't see that i have

00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:29,090
this thing and i'm gonna show you how to

00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,710
get this thing but you'll notice i'm on

00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,990
the same page but I now got this lovely

00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:34,730
little review button down here I also

00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:36,110
have this even lovelier little simply

00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,789
testing me button I'm going to talk

00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,809
about both of those so the patch we were

00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:42,620
just looking at it is this one right

00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:43,789
here if I click review oh this is so

00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,129
much easier to read because it's

00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:49,610
color-coded right red things are deleted

00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:52,190
and green things are added what else can

00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:54,259
I do in here well let's say that I want

00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:55,519
to leave a comment this is you know it's

00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:56,840
something big is patching the world but

00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,009
there's some stuff going on here but

00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,110
let's say I want him to leave a comment

00:33:58,009 --> 00:34:03,259
specifically about this line and this

00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:06,379
line i can highlight those two lines and

00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:10,970
i get this box over here and say what is

00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:12,919
this for I don't understand whatever the

00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:15,290
comment is right this is kind of just

00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:16,849
demonstrative but all right and I can

00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:21,349
save that and then I can come down here

00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:24,740
and I could say on this line don't

00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:27,440
delete that bar we need that later

00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:29,329
alright so I've kind of gone through and

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,919
i'm reviewing this particular patch

00:34:29,329 --> 00:34:32,419
again right now i'm only reviewing

00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:34,609
because i haven't applied the patch i'm

00:34:32,419 --> 00:34:39,710
only reviewing for style and for gotchas

00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:42,770
and strategy so i say that save and once

00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:48,589
i'm done i can click paste now if you

00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:49,970
look at this guy i can see that i'm

00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:52,280
going to preview it because it's easier

00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:55,520
to see i'm going to preview this comment

00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,770
I can see that hey the thing I

00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:01,430
highlighted is in here in a code tag

00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:02,900
already for me with my comment same with

00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:06,349
the second one same with the third one

00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:08,329
it makes reviewing patches so much

00:35:06,349 --> 00:35:11,240
easier so this tool that I've been using

00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:13,790
is called redditor alright and you can

00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:19,579
get it as a new site called it's called

00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:22,550
it's called it is called dreaded ER

00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:24,140
doctor dreaded org there you go um

00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,300
that's where you can get it it's

00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,829
available for chrome and for firefox if

00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,710
you're using firefox you need another

00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:33,349
extension for firefox called wet monkey

00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:34,609
but it's pretty easy to install so i

00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:36,619
highly highly highly highly recommend

00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:38,240
using jedit ER there's also a bunch of

00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:40,900
other tools that redditor gives you to

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,829
make this issue's page a lot more usable

00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:46,160
and i'll just go through those really

00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:48,230
quick if you are the maintainer of a

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,460
module for example i'm not on the issue

00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,380
patient where i want to comment for you

00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:55,160
if you're the maintainer of a module and

00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:56,569
you have you have dreaded installed you

00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,760
get this create commit message button

00:35:56,569 --> 00:36:01,010
down here right so i can create the

00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,420
commit message it'll put a link to every

00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:04,760
name of every person that submitted a

00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:06,020
patch and i can click OH alberto is the

00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,210
one who really did most of the work on

00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:10,369
this and i can copy that commit message

00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:12,950
and it will make sure that it's in the

00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:16,099
you know kind of the appropriate format

00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:17,930
for get commits that you know that are

00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:19,849
expected on drupal.org and it gives

00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:22,280
credit to the person who did you know

00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:24,530
the chunk of the work notice that it

00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,150
gives credit in two places right it has

00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:28,940
everybody's name who appears in these

00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:31,520
buttons separated by a comma and then it

00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,930
has the author you know and get only

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,730
allows one value so that's what kind of

00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:37,339
what you're picking there so that's

00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:39,140
incredibly useful making this sticky is

00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:40,640
incredibly useful especially on a long

00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,559
issue

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,410
right I could be typing and say oh in

00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:47,599
comment number 127 so-and-so said such

00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:49,089
and such but in comment number 283

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,859
such-and-such that's something else

00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:53,180
other things it'll do if you're you know

00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:56,980
let's say that that is the comment that

00:36:53,180 --> 00:37:00,260
you're doing right what about comment3

00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:02,420
and on our number three rather number

00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,910
three and I hit tab it makes a link

00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:06,619
directly to that comment alright so

00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:08,660
there's tons of cut a little hidden gems

00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:11,630
and redditor that make going through the

00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:13,579
issue queue much much much easier going

00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,720
back to our summarizing the issue yeah

00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:17,180
when you say hey what are the proposed

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,769
resolutions well wouldn't it be great to

00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:20,450
say one proposed resolution with

00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:22,970
resolution a and one was resolution be

00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:24,740
linked directly to those two comments

00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:27,049
especially if it's a nice big long issue

00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,700
makes it easier for everybody and

00:37:27,049 --> 00:37:31,039
there's really no extra work to do it if

00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:34,160
you're using something like this I can

00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:35,390
make this unstick II clone an issue if

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,549
there's an issue out there that's pretty

00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:38,990
close to what you wanted not it's not

00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:40,250
gonna include the comments but including

00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,559
kind of all the metadata up here at the

00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:44,839
top clone it and just change the one

00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:46,759
little piece that you wanted to change I

00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:48,740
personally haven't found this totally

00:37:46,759 --> 00:37:50,240
useful yet because if it's that close

00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,619
then you probably wanted to stick to

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,269
this issue but it's it's new and it's

00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:54,740
there the last thing I want to talk

00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:56,750
about and I pointed to this is this

00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:59,750
simply test me simply test me is

00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:01,730
phenomenal all right if you want to

00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:03,769
actually review a patch including the

00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:04,849
code and functionality of it but you

00:38:03,769 --> 00:38:06,200
don't really have a local dev

00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:08,480
environment you're not really set up

00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,490
this is a great way to do it if i click

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,279
simply test me and hopefully internet

00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:15,200
don't fail me now it's going to say hey

00:38:13,279 --> 00:38:16,450
what project are you testing what

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,650
version of Drupal are we talking about

00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:20,809
do you want to make sure there are any

00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:22,759
other modules installed at the time you

00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:24,410
test it right maybe maybe a

00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:27,109
representative image that doesn't depend

00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:29,769
on views but it has some stuff that uses

00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:32,839
views so maybe I want to you know add

00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:35,210
views and it open give me a list and say

00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:37,640
oh there it is okay and are there any

00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:39,049
patches to apply well but you know by

00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,180
default it puts that in there dreddit ER

00:38:39,049 --> 00:38:42,950
puts that in there for me and i can add

00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:46,190
another patch if like this was an issue

00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:47,569
that also requires a patch for core to

00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:50,299
make this all work i can add two or

00:38:47,569 --> 00:38:52,400
three patches and I click Launch sandbox

00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:55,330
and then I wait for about 10 minutes

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,010
um it's not really ten minutes let's see

00:38:55,330 --> 00:39:01,490
look it's doing much better today than

00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:03,290
it was a couple days ago but anyway I'll

00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:04,580
let that go for a few minutes and

00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:06,650
what'll end up happening is I'll have a

00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:08,600
fully functioning vanilla Drupal site

00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:11,390
with nothing installed except vanilla

00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:14,210
Drupal representative image and views

00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:18,320
that I can now click around in and test

00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:20,060
it it's fantastic so simply test me is a

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,640
hugely hugely helpful tool it just came

00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:25,220
around they three or four months ago and

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,840
it's kind of in my opinion it's really

00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:31,070
revolutionized a lot of testing that you

00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:33,800
can do okay so that well let's see if

00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:35,960
it's there yet it's so close its close

00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,570
enough to taste there we go okay so it

00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:41,570
plops in my admin and my password I can

00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:43,460
login and escape out of my little one

00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:48,130
password thing and I can see under

00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:51,110
configuration and under media where they

00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:53,540
where are you there's media now there it

00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:55,760
is there's my representative images you

00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:57,800
know link for configuration and I can

00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,050
now go through this and say oh I want to

00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:03,140
play with this path with dispatching

00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:04,730
actually adds this path option down here

00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:06,170
and I'm gonna try it out and see if it

00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:09,350
works and comment back on the issue

00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:10,700
accordingly if you want to do it a

00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:11,990
little bit we all have finer tune

00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,900
control and do it a little bit old

00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:16,700
school you can um you know apply the

00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:19,130
patch using normal get tools i'm going

00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:21,980
to show that real quick there's a little

00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:30,620
bit too zoomed in is that still readable

00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:34,340
for the most part whoops ok so i am in

00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:36,070
my local Drupal 7 site and let's assume

00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:39,530
i downloaded that patch to my desktop

00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:42,380
right in order to apply it and get it's

00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:45,320
very simple get apply and then the path

00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:46,910
to the patch so this patch is called

00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,290
rapid i'm actually do the comment i have

00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,250
a different patch in the desktop I kind

00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,750
of put everything there because the

00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,100
internet wasn't working earlier so had

00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,720
to run back to the hotel and download

00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,830
everything so that if the internet

00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,620
wasn't working during this I could still

00:40:54,830 --> 00:41:00,740
dem other things and that's not how you

00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:01,880
spell apply at all get Apple it's not

00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:04,740
going to do any

00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:06,570
alright so there we go get apply so i

00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:10,290
downloaded that patch to my desktop and

00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:12,360
I did get apply and it says okay we

00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:13,740
applied it quick warning that applied it

00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,000
after fixing a little white space area

00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:17,250
that I must have had in the patch maybe

00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,690
I use tabs and subspaces that's no good

00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:21,810
and I have my get set up to yell at me

00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:25,830
when I do that and now if I do get

00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:28,950
status status there we go i've modified

00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:32,100
yeah this one file is modified here and

00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:34,170
if I do get diff then I can see what am

00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,869
I fixing here is probably really hard to

00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:38,040
see it but implements is spelled wrong

00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:41,040
right implements should be spelled

00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:45,690
correctly so that fixes it if I scroll

00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:49,200
down a little bit um where's my this

00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:53,580
comment was um somehow inadequate right

00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:57,210
so what's up should be one line it

00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:58,980
should well it should be one line the

00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:02,490
general rule of thumb is 80 characters

00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:04,440
and I'm just so zoomed in that you can't

00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:07,230
tell that I'm behaving and i am at 80

00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:10,920
characters so that's pretty good I

00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:13,020
didn't have the type on the on the

00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,790
parameter a my comment right i should

00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:17,640
say object or string or whatever type

00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:19,020
that can can accept and so on so i can

00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,520
keep going down and all of these are

00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:25,619
basically just issues with the comments

00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:29,010
alright so i'm going to quit out of that

00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:31,440
and we're going to actually kind of go

00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:33,690
through the process right now of opening

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,760
an issue submitting a patch and then

00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:37,800
assuming you are the contributor we're

00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,140
going to review the patch accept the

00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,119
patch and commit the patch alright so

00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:44,250
let's just go through that whole process

00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,840
which kind of runs the gambit you know

00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,950
if you're if you're new to oldest you

00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,390
probably want to do the first couple of

00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:50,160
these steps if you're getting more and

00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:52,619
more in advance you'll do the last

00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:57,869
couple of these steps so I'm going to go

00:42:52,619 --> 00:43:00,119
back to that there is representative

00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:01,700
images oh no that's not it that's our

00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:06,740
little fake site I'm going to go to

00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:06,740
representative images represe

00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:16,590
my spelling it right representative

00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:18,030
image there we go and we're going to

00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:20,760
assume I already look through to see if

00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:22,320
anyone has you know opened an issue

00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:25,800
saying hey all the comments need to be

00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:30,780
cleaned up and no one has so I create a

00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:34,770
new issue this is for version 7 17 X 1 X

00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:37,140
dev which is kind of head this is a

00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:40,410
documentation problem category is a bug

00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:44,700
fix our bug report it also be a task

00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:48,870
really write clean up the the comments

00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:52,590
and I already is definitely critical no

00:43:48,870 --> 00:44:01,740
card is minor and i'm going to say clean

00:43:52,590 --> 00:44:08,210
up comments a bunch of the comments

00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:11,940
don't meet the drupal coding standards

00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:16,590
we should fix that right always be nice

00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:19,080
have a nice day okay all right I can't

00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:21,870
type today it's hard to type when you're

00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:23,940
looking behind you and I'm going to open

00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:27,240
this issue so there we go so we've

00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:31,590
opened a new issue there's this issue

00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:34,710
and that's pretty good you've opened our

00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:37,020
issue so let's actually submit our patch

00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:39,750
to do that I'm going to choose a file

00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:41,910
and on my desktop now of course the

00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:44,400
assumption here is that I've made all

00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:46,950
the changes and I've tested them locally

00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,840
right on the module maintainer Xin

00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:50,550
particular get kind of frustrated when

00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:52,080
someone throws up a nice big patch

00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:53,670
they're having never tested it and then

00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,230
the module maintainer applies the patch

00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,390
and just everything explodes all of a

00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:58,860
sudden so make sure that you're testing

00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:00,210
what you're doing in our case it's just

00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:02,730
comment so you can't really break

00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:06,960
anything with comments but here's my

00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:11,050
patch so I can attach that file I can

00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:17,770
say here we go made a patch

00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:21,850
to fix this fix this and apparently I've

00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:24,340
scrum in 30 minutes and i'm going to

00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:29,050
save that comment but i forgot something

00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:30,550
all right there's a very key um I don't

00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:31,990
even other word I'm looking for there's

00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:34,090
a key step that I forgot which is

00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:35,950
whenever you submit a patch always all

00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:37,330
the time without exception do you submit

00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:39,370
that's not sure if there are exceptions

00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:41,050
but they're really rare if you submit a

00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:43,870
patch you always want to set this to

00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:47,710
needs review the reason for doing that

00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:50,710
is because if you upload a file the way

00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:53,310
that I not actually hit submit weird my

00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:53,310
comment go

00:45:55,559 --> 00:46:02,069
let's reload see what happens there it

00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:05,339
is okay um but like I said if you know I

00:46:02,069 --> 00:46:09,059
forgot to do in these review if you

00:46:05,339 --> 00:46:11,939
upload a file called dot patch anything

00:46:09,059 --> 00:46:14,699
dot patch and you set the status to

00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:16,979
needs review then Drupal's test bot will

00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:19,309
come along and see that issue and it

00:46:16,979 --> 00:46:23,459
will run through all of the simple tests

00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:25,349
necessary if it's a contributor module

00:46:23,459 --> 00:46:26,549
has tests they should if you're going to

00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:28,229
be writing your own control module you

00:46:26,549 --> 00:46:30,719
should be having simple tests and you

00:46:28,229 --> 00:46:33,569
can set up on drupal.org your project to

00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:36,390
run most simple tests but core every

00:46:33,569 --> 00:46:38,309
patch that gets submitted for core that

00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:40,380
every file that ends in patch when you

00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:43,709
set it to needs review it's going to run

00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:45,329
through all what like 45,000 tests that

00:46:43,709 --> 00:46:48,209
exists in court now some ridiculous

00:46:45,329 --> 00:46:49,469
number it takes a few minutes sometimes

00:46:48,209 --> 00:46:53,279
it can take as much as like half an hour

00:46:49,469 --> 00:46:55,189
45 minutes but if you so we want to do

00:46:53,279 --> 00:47:04,319
this i might do need set review what

00:46:55,189 --> 00:47:07,949
forgot to set for review your test and i

00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:14,839
saved it what's going to happen once it

00:47:07,949 --> 00:47:16,709
saves is and we fresh real quick is

00:47:14,839 --> 00:47:18,929
didn't the other it is queued for

00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:21,029
testing right it took a second now it's

00:47:18,929 --> 00:47:22,890
cute for testing once test pot comes

00:47:21,029 --> 00:47:24,119
along and like decides okay i'm going to

00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:26,519
i'm going to go through the test this is

00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:28,170
going to turn yellow and then once test

00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:29,880
pot comes along and says alright you

00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:32,099
passed all your tests it will turn green

00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,869
if you fail the test it'll turn red and

00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:35,009
give you a little link saying you know

00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:36,920
here's some more details about what

00:47:35,009 --> 00:47:39,209
failed the details about what failed

00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:42,599
aren't you know it's not like it says 0

00:47:39,209 --> 00:47:44,910
line 72 you screwed that up they're not

00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:47,429
as helpful as one would hope but they at

00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:49,229
least tell you this test failed and you

00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:51,239
can look at the code for that test and

00:47:49,229 --> 00:47:53,699
say oh well what it's trying to do here

00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:55,199
is make sure that i can save a node and

00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:56,729
it's not letting me save a note let's

00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:58,650
try and you know go through that process

00:47:56,729 --> 00:48:01,319
manually on my local development machine

00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:02,099
and see if i can have that same break

00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:04,289
happen

00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:06,180
can great I can fix it I can't then I'm

00:48:04,289 --> 00:48:08,039
going to start to maybe go into IRC and

00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:10,619
ask questions or talk to other people

00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:13,619
and see if I can't figure out what might

00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:17,160
be going on from time to time test spot

00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:20,309
goes on vacation if that happens try

00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:22,789
again the next day um it or couple hours

00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:27,779
later on test spot is a fickle friend

00:48:22,789 --> 00:48:30,630
and doesn't always work but i'd say i'd

00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:32,369
say 51 weeks of the year test bot is

00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:34,019
great but there's that one week

00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:37,680
scattered throughout that's pretty

00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:39,299
pretty terrible okay so now what we what

00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:42,299
have we done we've opened an issue we've

00:48:39,299 --> 00:48:44,249
submitted a patch for it let's now kind

00:48:42,299 --> 00:48:45,839
of go to flip side and now you're the

00:48:44,249 --> 00:48:48,599
module maintainer right you're the

00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:50,579
contributor on this is your control well

00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:51,809
let's let's review it all right so I

00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:53,279
come on to this issue and I say o

00:48:51,809 --> 00:48:56,220
someone has opened an issue and give me

00:48:53,279 --> 00:48:57,630
a patch let's take a look alright so

00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:59,220
we've fixed some comments here that

00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:01,829
looks good we fixed some comments here

00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:03,150
on one another good thing about dreaded

00:49:01,829 --> 00:49:05,640
ER and I don't know if I have any

00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:07,289
examples of it I hopefully don't is if

00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,299
you for example have tabs in here

00:49:07,289 --> 00:49:10,469
instead of spaces or if you have an

00:49:09,299 --> 00:49:11,999
extra space at the end of your line

00:49:10,469 --> 00:49:13,259
dreddit ER will actually like blink it

00:49:11,999 --> 00:49:15,809
right on a blanket but like make it

00:49:13,259 --> 00:49:17,309
bright red indicating hey you have a

00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:18,569
little bit of a coding standard problem

00:49:17,309 --> 00:49:20,549
they're definitely doesn't catch

00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:21,930
everything but whatever can catch it

00:49:20,549 --> 00:49:25,619
tells you about which is really nice

00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:26,549
especially as the maintainer so I'm

00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:28,049
going to look through this and I'm going

00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:30,960
to see all right this looks great or

00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:33,900
this doesn't look great and actually

00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,869
this is a problem this shouldn't be in

00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:38,819
here this is not a comment fix right so

00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:42,059
when I made my patch I screwed that up a

00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:43,979
little bit so right this is not a

00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:47,700
comment fix that belongs in another

00:49:43,979 --> 00:49:52,529
issue whatever it is probably belongs

00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:54,420
and another issue right so i can save

00:49:52,529 --> 00:50:01,499
that and what i'll do i'll go through

00:49:54,420 --> 00:50:07,799
the process right now and i will here's

00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:09,500
the code in question i am going to that

00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:11,630
was actually well what was that problem

00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,740
look again oh really all this was was it

00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:14,990
was actually just a white space problem

00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:16,430
if I look a little bit closer but just

00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:18,140
for the sake of argument let's just

00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:21,860
change it around just to see what

00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:28,130
happens so there's break to it mine was

00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:29,510
that line 189 so there we go that's

00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:32,660
actually the problem there's a tab in

00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:35,330
there don't know why that was there so

00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:39,140
let's actually just save this and I'm

00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:43,310
going to do get this and I'll see that

00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:45,200
should go away yeah it's not in there

00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:49,790
anymore as part of this gifted oh no it

00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:53,330
isn't there hmm all right well let's see

00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:55,220
what happens here I'm quit I'm going to

00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:56,690
do get diff and this is how you create a

00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:59,680
patch if you haven't created a patch

00:50:56,690 --> 00:51:02,330
before you make sure that whatever

00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:04,400
contributes chords core that you've

00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:06,350
checked it out using get all right

00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,990
that's the easiest way by far to create

00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:11,450
a patch so I'm in the actual

00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:14,090
representative image folder I'm going to

00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:16,250
get diff and I just do a greater than

00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:18,800
sign and then the name of the file so

00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:22,970
desktop and then it is representative

00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:24,950
lips rip image comments patch I'm

00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:30,260
overriding it and now I'm going to go

00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:33,320
back to go back to this issue and say I

00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:38,440
don't cancel out a paste because I had

00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:38,440
made a comment in there and I'll save

00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:47,840
right now you'll notice magically oh

00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:49,580
it's not magically doesn't this usually

00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:52,610
put it back to needs work I thought it

00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:54,110
only if it fails the test thank you all

00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,610
right so I should have said this to

00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:59,000
needs work right as the module

00:51:55,610 --> 00:52:02,780
maintainer now so i'll save that and set

00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:05,000
it to needs work and now as the person

00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:06,820
actually doing the contributing i'm

00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,930
going to say oh I fixed it right

00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:12,430
whenever you upload a patch you want to

00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:17,140
set this back to needs review and say I

00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:21,339
fixed that issue you found

00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:26,519
in number four tab and it puts the link

00:52:21,339 --> 00:52:26,519
right in there yes you can hack him ah

00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:37,390
afforded yes that's absolutely right so

00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:39,309
and I didn't upload an inner div okay I

00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:41,200
was going to go into inner diffs but I'm

00:52:39,309 --> 00:52:42,819
glad that you brought it up so introduce

00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,890
our especially especially especially

00:52:42,819 --> 00:52:47,140
with big patches are really important

00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:51,789
all right imagine i upload a patch that

00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:53,470
is you know 5k 500 lines of Chino 5k is

00:52:51,789 --> 00:52:55,779
not five minute lights but whatever 500

00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:58,180
lines of changes and somebody comes

00:52:55,779 --> 00:53:00,670
along and says hey there was a you know

00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:02,529
a spelling mistake or there's this one

00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:03,700
little thing you need to change well the

00:53:02,529 --> 00:53:06,609
person who has gone through the effort

00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:07,630
of reviewing that initial patch does not

00:53:06,609 --> 00:53:10,180
want to go through the effort of

00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:11,980
reviewing the entire patch again just to

00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:14,740
confirm that I fixed that one minor

00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:16,210
change that they wanted to make just for

00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:18,519
times sake I'm not going to go through

00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:20,380
the process right now sorry Kathy but

00:53:18,519 --> 00:53:23,200
it's not too hard and there's a great

00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:25,269
post on on drupal.org if you just do

00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,670
drupal interred if you'll promise you'll

00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:29,319
get it right there but basically what it

00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:31,269
does is it allows you to upload two

00:53:29,319 --> 00:53:33,369
separate files one is the big huge patch

00:53:31,269 --> 00:53:36,160
with just your little tiny extra change

00:53:33,369 --> 00:53:38,799
that you made and the other is looks

00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:40,900
very similar right it looks like one of

00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:43,329
these but it only showed shows the

00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:44,859
changes from the previous patch you know

00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:46,359
as long as you did it right so that way

00:53:44,859 --> 00:53:47,619
you can see oh he just fixed the

00:53:46,359 --> 00:53:49,390
spelling mistake that I told them to

00:53:47,619 --> 00:53:52,809
excellent now I don't need to review

00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:55,809
this entire patch again so this guy can

00:53:52,809 --> 00:53:57,490
be very very helpful okay so now let's

00:53:55,809 --> 00:54:01,869
actually go back in there let's review

00:53:57,490 --> 00:54:03,039
this again and sure enough I don't know

00:54:01,869 --> 00:54:05,230
why it's still in there I don't know

00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:12,730
what keeps screwing with that but let's

00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:14,109
pretend for what's up yeah but it

00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:18,819
shouldn't have been like that to begin

00:54:14,109 --> 00:54:20,710
with I don't know um anyway I don't want

00:54:18,819 --> 00:54:22,839
to kind of get bogged down on a little

00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:25,240
thing like that during during this but

00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:26,180
basic idea here is as the maintainer

00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:29,150
again I'm putting on

00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:30,770
my module maintainer hat I can actually

00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:33,170
sit there and say okay this patch is

00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:35,990
excellent and I've tested it by applying

00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:37,520
it locally right which I can I

00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:43,250
downloaded it applied it the same way

00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:44,750
and I can say get ad minus a so and I

00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:46,370
should just to get status first and

00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:48,170
double check you always want to do get

00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:50,750
status before you do get ad for those of

00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:51,500
you who are fairly new to get because

00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:53,120
you want to make sure you're not

00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,500
accidentally adding some other wackadoo

00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:56,510
files that had nothing to do with this

00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:59,810
change and I'm not so I'm going to do

00:54:56,510 --> 00:55:01,550
get ad minus a I could also just do get

00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:04,850
ad and specify the file and I want to

00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:06,200
add and now I could you get commit- m

00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:12,760
and start writing out that big long

00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:17,110
message or I can go back to here and

00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:22,280
create the commit message say that I

00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:28,100
fixed it copy this and lips and go back

00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:30,080
into my terminal and paste it now I've

00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:32,000
committed it and I can do git push

00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:33,740
origin I'm not going to do it I want to

00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,200
figure out why what I mess up with that

00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:39,200
little space there but if I would do get

00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:41,270
push origin that's it it's done almost

00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,370
all right the code is there it's done

00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:46,640
with respect to the code what isn't

00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:48,470
there however is an update to this issue

00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,150
that's the last thing as a maintainer

00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:52,580
you want to make sure you always do is

00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:54,530
come back to the issue say thank you so

00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:56,420
much to whoever it was that submitted

00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:59,000
the code right if it was you you can pat

00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:00,920
yourself on the back that's fine but you

00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,600
know usually or hopefully it was someone

00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:04,940
else who was helping you out but you

00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,500
want to set this to fixed right you want

00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:07,580
to set this issue to fixed and the other

00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,620
thing you want to do is you want to say

00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:12,770
hey I fixed this here's a link to that

00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:14,540
commit okay the way to get that link is

00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:15,830
the way that I always do it I feel like

00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:17,510
there must be another way to do this but

00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:19,970
I open up the project page in another

00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:23,330
tab and down here on the side is a

00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:25,540
repository viewer and a view commits so

00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:27,860
if I click the view commits I will see

00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:29,960
all the commits that I pushed up to

00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:31,550
origin from wherever I push them out so

00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,400
let's assume for example that this was

00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:37,490
my most recent commit I click on it and

00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:39,410
I can just copy this URL right here but

00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:40,450
just very quickly to look through what

00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:41,980
do you get in here well you

00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:43,270
information about you know what was the

00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:47,980
parent commit and all that kind of you

00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:50,440
know get those get details but you also

00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:52,030
can look at the commit diff and see what

00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,380
changed in the last commit right now

00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:55,720
that's commit I guess we added this

00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:59,170
comment here in this comment here and so

00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:00,760
on and I can look at the tree and I

00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:02,800
could look at the log the short log

00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:05,500
write a short log is just a list of the

00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:08,109
commits very briefly this is really

00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:10,089
really useful especially if you want to

00:57:08,109 --> 00:57:12,910
send information about the git

00:57:10,089 --> 00:57:14,170
repository to someone else right for the

00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:15,910
most part this is all information if you

00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:18,579
have to get repository clone locally you

00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:19,839
can just get excuse me using it but if

00:57:18,579 --> 00:57:21,609
you don't where you want to point

00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:22,780
someone to a specific commit or a

00:57:21,609 --> 00:57:24,250
specific comment and it commits

00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:30,060
something like that this is really super

00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:33,480
helpful so I come down to here and um I

00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:45,640
would say you know thanks a ton

00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:48,720
exclamation point of the whole life

00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:51,310
cycle of someone identified a problem

00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,800
someone wrote the patch somebody

00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:55,480
reviewed the patch I screwed up the

00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,010
patch so somebody wrote another patch

00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:59,530
still screwed up but we're going to

00:57:57,010 --> 00:58:01,359
pretend it's not I reviewed the patch

00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:02,410
right and doesn't have to be the core

00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:05,680
maintainer who does most of the

00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:07,450
reviewing or the or the contrarian taner

00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,490
the model maintainer typically they will

00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:11,650
write before they put it in hopefully at

00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:15,369
least give it a good looking at but

00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:16,270
often module often issues get back and

00:58:15,369 --> 00:58:17,950
forth and back and forth between

00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:19,750
reviewer and the person writing the code

00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:22,869
and it's not the model maintainer and

00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:25,329
then we committed it and we closed out

00:58:22,869 --> 00:58:28,869
the issue so that's the entire kind of

00:58:25,329 --> 00:58:35,140
workflow for that process so I'm going

00:58:28,869 --> 00:58:38,280
to keep going okay so the next thing

00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:41,170
that you can do you can write your own

00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:42,520
control I'm not going to go through and

00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:43,839
demonstrate the process of writing an

00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,430
entire control module because that will

00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,990
take a really long time but what I do

00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:48,609
want to talk about is a couple of things

00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:51,400
to keep in mind the first thing is

00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:53,140
before you write your own control ask

00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:56,019
yourself if a module already

00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:58,510
exists for that particular problem even

00:58:56,019 --> 00:59:00,160
if there's one that's close right better

00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:01,869
to work with a module that already

00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:04,990
exists that gets you ninety percent of

00:59:01,869 --> 00:59:06,190
the way there then creating your own the

00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:08,470
last thing that we want to have on

00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:11,529
drupal.org is 75 different modules that

00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:14,400
print out a debug statement right devel

00:59:11,529 --> 00:59:16,809
does that pretty well can it be improved

00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:19,210
absolutely but do we need another module

00:59:16,809 --> 00:59:21,789
that does basically the same thing not

00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:23,799
really right so ask yourself if that

00:59:21,789 --> 00:59:25,630
module already exists somewhere right if

00:59:23,799 --> 00:59:27,670
it does try and work with that module

00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:30,549
maintainer try and get your changes that

00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:32,049
you need into that module but if it

00:59:30,549 --> 00:59:33,460
doesn't and you've come up you know with

00:59:32,049 --> 00:59:35,289
a totally new problem that hasn't really

00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:37,869
been solved in Drupal you should create

00:59:35,289 --> 00:59:40,720
a sandbox project all right creating a

00:59:37,869 --> 00:59:43,569
sandbox project is pretty

00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:47,529
straightforward if you go to jupiler org

00:59:43,569 --> 00:59:53,529
um / oh wait i have a link in there I

00:59:47,529 --> 00:59:59,500
forgot the exact link dude you boo now a

00:59:53,529 --> 01:00:01,750
silly thing to do drupal.org / actually

00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:03,160
the way I do is get to it because I have

01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:04,509
the link paste it in there but

01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:08,019
apparently keen it doesn't let me

01:00:04,509 --> 01:00:09,549
actually click on a link is I go to my

01:00:08,019 --> 01:00:11,680
dashboard and I click on your projects

01:00:09,549 --> 01:00:12,940
and there's a nice little link right at

01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:16,180
the bottom here which is at a new

01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:18,009
project alright when you're adding a new

01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:20,769
project you know is it a module is a

01:00:18,009 --> 01:00:22,509
theme and so on it asks you a couple

01:00:20,769 --> 01:00:24,369
questions about it you know are you

01:00:22,509 --> 01:00:25,809
actively maintaining it or you know so

01:00:24,369 --> 01:00:26,950
on you give it a title and give it a

01:00:25,809 --> 01:00:30,519
description and then there's this

01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:32,890
sandbox check checkbox a sandbox project

01:00:30,519 --> 01:00:34,869
for those who don't know anyone in juba

01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:37,569
org can create a sandbox project at any

01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:39,670
time it's a great way to start getting

01:00:37,569 --> 01:00:41,559
your module going all right there's no

01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:44,170
reason to have a full-on project that

01:00:41,559 --> 01:00:46,930
people are downloading everywhere with

01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:48,640
like half written code and 10,000 to

01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:49,869
do's you know written in there you

01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,450
really want to kind of flesh out your

01:00:49,869 --> 01:00:54,190
ideas a little bit first but you still

01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:55,599
want a place to host it so that you can

01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:58,059
collaborate with other you know other

01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:59,769
dribble developers so you can get

01:00:58,059 --> 01:01:01,990
opinions on the code so that you can

01:00:59,769 --> 01:01:03,550
have people try it out some people are

01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:05,170
more conservative and others

01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:06,490
when they'll kind of cross that

01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:08,440
threshold and say this is no longer

01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:11,110
sandbox project this is a real project

01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:13,750
and it should have a name like views or

01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:18,370
admin menu or something more exciting

01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:20,860
than that you need to apply for full

01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:22,840
project maintainer status before you can

01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:24,880
make that switch from a sandbox project

01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:28,990
to a full project and in order to do

01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:34,120
that you can just go to I have this open

01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:39,070
the screen you can go to my stupid thing

01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:41,740
here no that's not it here it is project

01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:43,570
drupal.org / project such / project

01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:45,390
applications there's all sorts of

01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:48,250
details here about what you need to do

01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:51,610
helpful hint all right there is a

01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:53,260
program that basically allows you to

01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:55,180
kind of get your project a little bit

01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:56,710
higher in the priority list as people

01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:58,900
are reviewing before deciding whether to

01:01:56,710 --> 01:02:02,050
allow you to make it a full project and

01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:04,270
if you go through and you evaluate other

01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:06,850
people's applications for full project

01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:09,460
status and say hey this is a great idea

01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:10,840
or hey this is exactly the same as views

01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:13,990
why are we creating another module for

01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:15,700
that your hey your code is really

01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:18,610
terrific i'm really a fan something like

01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:22,360
that if you go through and you review

01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:24,550
other people's and notice our 234 open

01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:26,590
issues on this project those are all

01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:29,320
people applying to get project

01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:31,960
maintainer status then the people who

01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:34,030
are authorized to actually give you that

01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:36,370
right that promotion permission will

01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:38,920
kind of kick you up the line and look at

01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:40,330
yours a lot sooner so if you're really

01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:42,670
really eager to get that project

01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:44,080
maintainer status go ahead and review

01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:46,030
three or four other people and you'll

01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:51,670
kind of you know kick your kick your

01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:53,850
chances in gear so that is what you need

01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:56,080
to do in order to get a new project

01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:58,300
that's the reviewer bonus program what I

01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:00,670
was talking about and I already went

01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:02,260
through that don't forget to maintain

01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:03,640
your modules I know that sounds silly

01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:05,710
but you'd be amazed at how many people

01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:08,260
create a new project you get really

01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:11,170
excited about it for a week commit tons

01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:14,410
of code and then that's it they're done

01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:15,840
they leave and they never kind of look

01:03:14,410 --> 01:03:18,240
at the issue queue they never look

01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:20,310
you know people making feature requests

01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:22,830
people offering up their own code and

01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:28,110
submitting patches that's kind of

01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:31,200
unfortunate so one more slide and then

01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:33,540
I'm going to open the door to questions

01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:35,040
so the last thing and this is probably

01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:36,930
what you know most people kind of

01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:38,640
consider being a contributor but like i

01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:39,660
said before all the different steps

01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,100
we've gone through all the different

01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:44,010
things that we've discussed really are

01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:45,660
in my opinion you know attributes of

01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:47,760
being a contributor to Drupal every one

01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:49,380
of them but the last one is actually

01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:53,700
creating your own patch to either

01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:55,140
control or two to core I'm not going to

01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:57,660
go through that process because it's the

01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:59,730
same as I'm not going to do it through

01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:00,960
the core patch creating process because

01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:05,130
it really is the same as creating a

01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:07,620
patch for a control but a couple things

01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:10,020
to keep in mind this is actually the

01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:11,700
solution to and hopefully you've all

01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:14,030
heard this at least 300 times while

01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:17,580
you've been here not don't hack or write

01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:20,940
the solution to that is to create your

01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:24,030
own patch and submit it to that control

01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:27,630
or jacour right by submitting it you

01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:30,800
have at the very least opened up in a in

01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:33,900
a formal kind of easy to find location a

01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:36,390
summary of the problem and a suggestion

01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:38,670
for the solution we have in my in my

01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:40,140
team we have a rule where every once in

01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:42,060
a while you do come across something in

01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:44,280
a control or in Drupal core where you

01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:46,440
really do need to make a change so our

01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:48,570
rule and this is true of our entire

01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,700
organization is basically before you are

01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:52,860
allowed to make that change you must

01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:54,660
have opened an issue on drupal.org for

01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:57,480
that change and you must submit a patch

01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:58,740
back when appropriate um the reason for

01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:00,840
this is there's no reason you should

01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:02,970
ever be you know making a change to

01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:04,800
Drupal core or to a control unless

01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:06,750
there's either a bug or a feature that

01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:09,030
you need that isn't there and in both of

01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:10,860
those cases that patch should live on

01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:12,840
drupal.org there's a bunch of reasons

01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:14,580
for that someone else will review it

01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:16,830
right always having extra pair of eyes

01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:18,990
is good the maintainer you may come

01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:20,760
along and say oh that's not really a

01:05:18,990 --> 01:05:22,380
problem you're just doing it wrong right

01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:23,020
here's here's a solution that you can

01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:25,870
use that

01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:27,580
to you know change any code someone may

01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:30,070
come along and say oh there's a security

01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:33,250
problem with what you just did that's

01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:35,260
going to be a big deal especially if

01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:40,630
your site is is using e-commerce or

01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:41,980
something along those lines and a couple

01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:44,770
other quick points and then I'll just

01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:48,040
open up to questions get familiar with

01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:51,010
the Drupal coding standards right drupal

01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:53,050
coding standards are kind of seemed

01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:55,030
nitpicky when people you know you submit

01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:56,410
a big law and patched yeah we solve some

01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:58,660
big problem and someone comes along and

01:05:56,410 --> 01:06:00,790
says you need two spaces instead of tabs

01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:02,740
can get a little bit frustrating but if

01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:04,150
you get yourself familiar with that then

01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:06,130
you you want to deal with it anymore

01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:09,210
right you'll really be able to focus on

01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:12,340
on the problems you're trying to solve

01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:13,660
last point um you don't need to solve a

01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:15,430
hundred percent of a problem in order to

01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:17,830
submit a patch web chick wrote a great

01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:19,900
blog post it's kind of few years old at

01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:21,790
this point but she talks about the idea

01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:23,740
of the person one person who sits and

01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:25,780
writes this big long patch and takes two

01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:27,130
three four weeks to kind of solve the

01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:28,870
problem and figure out what they want to

01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:30,070
do and then submits the patch versus

01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:31,660
another person who kind of just gets a

01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:34,300
rough idea throws it up there that day

01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:35,800
by doing the rough idea and throwing it

01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:38,410
up there that day you can get immediate

01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:41,170
feedback and you can save yourself you

01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:43,420
know 13 other days of work you know with

01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:45,700
with other with other people looking at

01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:47,440
your you're quick idea and saying oh

01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:49,510
you're going down the wrong path try it

01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:51,370
this way instead whereas the person who

01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:54,700
takes two weeks to do it doesn't have

01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:56,530
that luxury they spent two weeks of

01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:57,820
doing work and then suddenly you know

01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:59,410
someone comes along and says oh we

01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:01,650
already fixed that or you went down the

01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:04,900
totally wrong path and that's not great

01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:07,650
so that's basically it if there are any

01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:11,620
questions again that's me on drupal.org

01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:13,960
i'm blaming or Bleen 18 and I well what

01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:15,310
time is are we getting close yeah we

01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,930
have five minutes so if there any

01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:22,080
questions come up with Mike or just

01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:22,080
shout them out that's good yeah

01:07:26,140 --> 01:08:09,500
I'll repeat the question um it's a fair

01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:10,640
question so the question was what

01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:12,859
happens when kind of the reverse happens

01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:15,050
on IRC when you when you're trying to

01:08:12,859 --> 01:08:17,239
suggest an idea or try and get you get

01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:19,339
your patch into a core modular core or

01:08:17,239 --> 01:08:20,870
control and the maintainer doesn't want

01:08:19,339 --> 01:08:23,870
to hear from you and is kind of

01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:25,940
obnoxious about it I mean there's not

01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:28,819
too much you can do about that other

01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:32,600
than to you know try and you know ask

01:08:28,819 --> 01:08:34,850
them nicely if they'll reconsider other

01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:36,589
than that it's it's really kind of at

01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:37,910
the the maintainer discretion if it's a

01:08:36,589 --> 01:08:40,520
core maintainer you should definitely

01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:42,469
let some people know about that I know

01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:44,509
all the core maintain errs to one degree

01:08:42,469 --> 01:08:46,759
or another and I can't imagine any of

01:08:44,509 --> 01:08:48,949
them ever actually doing that but

01:08:46,759 --> 01:08:52,630
controls or construed modules if it

01:08:48,949 --> 01:08:55,069
starts to get like really inappropriate

01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:58,190
that you should you should kind of find

01:08:55,069 --> 01:09:00,319
find someone from the other I guess the

01:08:58,190 --> 01:09:02,179
drupal association or you know one of

01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:03,529
the long-standing members of drupal who

01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:06,259
you happen to know and ask them what you

01:09:03,529 --> 01:09:08,330
might be able to do about that Drupal

01:09:06,259 --> 01:09:10,609
does have a core a code of conduct that

01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:12,290
you know essentially is be respectful of

01:09:10,609 --> 01:09:14,330
other people but you have to summarize

01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:16,130
it in one sentence so if someone is

01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:18,049
really being disrespectful you know you

01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:19,429
can kind of call them out on that if you

01:09:18,049 --> 01:09:20,630
want to go through that process but in

01:09:19,429 --> 01:09:21,890
terms of like getting your patch in

01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:23,839
there's nothing you can do about getting

01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:25,390
your patch in if it's their control and

01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:28,520
they just don't want to hear from you

01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:30,620
that's unfortunate you can put yeah you

01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:32,679
can fork their their their module you

01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:34,809
can offer to be a co maintainer if they

01:09:32,679 --> 01:09:38,259
if the problem really is I don't have a

01:09:34,809 --> 01:09:39,670
time for you you can you know try and

01:09:38,259 --> 01:09:40,869
get if there's more than one maintainer

01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:43,329
maybe try and get in touch with one of

01:09:40,869 --> 01:09:44,799
the other maintained errs but there's

01:09:43,329 --> 01:09:58,599
there's not too much you can do about

01:09:44,799 --> 01:10:02,559
that any other questions yep maintainer

01:09:58,599 --> 01:10:07,559
dozen I can't find my dream after few

01:10:02,559 --> 01:10:10,570
comments and maybe up to a few emails

01:10:07,559 --> 01:10:17,260
here's a lot of batteries waiting for

01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:21,280
review mm-hmm waiting for it for me like

01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:22,570
there's no mighty so the question is

01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:24,130
really what happens when the maintainer

01:10:22,570 --> 01:10:25,809
is just not responsive at all and

01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:27,519
there's a bunch of patches just waiting

01:10:25,809 --> 01:10:33,820
in the queue and you want to get this

01:10:27,519 --> 01:10:34,900
module moving along okay so the date mon

01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:37,479
yeah that is actually pretty good

01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:39,610
example um a couple things can happen

01:10:37,479 --> 01:10:43,119
either someone can step up and say I

01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:45,219
will help maintain this module and if

01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:47,739
you open if if the maintainer is not

01:10:45,219 --> 01:10:49,959
even responding to that request you can

01:10:47,739 --> 01:10:51,369
open an issue in the issue queue and say

01:10:49,959 --> 01:10:52,900
please make me maintainer I'd really

01:10:51,369 --> 01:10:55,510
like to help move this module along and

01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:58,659
if it stays open for a reasonable amount

01:10:55,510 --> 01:11:00,670
of time and nobody on nobody responds to

01:10:58,659 --> 01:11:03,519
it you can open an issue in the in the

01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:04,989
project applications queue and say hey I

01:11:03,519 --> 01:11:06,849
really like to help move this module

01:11:04,989 --> 01:11:08,650
along nobody go maintainer has been

01:11:06,849 --> 01:11:11,380
responding to my requests I'd like to

01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:14,320
take it over and someone on that team

01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:16,179
will evaluate you know the the situation

01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:18,249
and if you know they feel it's

01:11:16,179 --> 01:11:19,719
appropriate then they will make you a

01:11:18,249 --> 01:11:22,840
maintainer and you end up taking over

01:11:19,719 --> 01:11:24,099
that module if if that's not something

01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,329
you want to take the responsibility for

01:11:24,099 --> 01:11:27,610
or you don't feel you're at the level to

01:11:25,329 --> 01:11:29,349
take responsibility for that um you know

01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:30,639
you can try and find someone who would

01:11:29,349 --> 01:11:32,650
be willing to if you look through the

01:11:30,639 --> 01:11:34,449
issue queue for that module and you

01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:36,729
happen to see that there's that one guy

01:11:34,449 --> 01:11:40,599
or that one girl who's who's committing

01:11:36,729 --> 01:11:42,699
our singh patch after patch of your

01:11:40,599 --> 01:11:45,610
patch mm-hmm this will be last question

01:11:42,699 --> 01:11:46,320
um then maybe that person is a great

01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:48,270
person to

01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,710
kind of tap and say you know no one's

01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:51,510
been responding maybe you want to take

01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:53,460
the module over that would be terrific

01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:56,790
and you know you can try and help out

01:11:53,460 --> 01:12:00,960
