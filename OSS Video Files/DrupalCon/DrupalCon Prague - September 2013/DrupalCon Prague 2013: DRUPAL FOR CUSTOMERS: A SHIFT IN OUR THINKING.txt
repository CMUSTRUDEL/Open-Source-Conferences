Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: DRUPAL FOR CUSTOMERS: A SHIFT IN OUR THINKING
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	In the beginning, it was so easy. Gather requirements from the customer, draw them up, choose a language, build a website. As more and more open source frameworks came to bear, we found ourselves spending more time discussing the various licenses involved and negotiating features with our customers. Do you really need the banner to blink? What does an -alpha mean? Is it safe for us to use a -dev version of a module if it's an active project? How do we deal with change?

With so many questions and variables thrown into the traditional process of designing software, we've had to change the way we plan, sell, build, scale, and contribute web applications. Join webkenny and his (always) zany cast of characters as we explore what it means to build sites in the fast-moving landscape of Drupal.

We will discuss:

Sell. What does it mean to sell Drupal services? How do you set yourself apart? Demystifying the General Public License. Explaining the model to our customers.
Plan. The evolving conversation of a project. Meeting requirements with module and library selection. The process of building something that changes every day.
Build. Working in rhythm. Provide continuous feedback at all stages of the project.
Scale. Understanding our options in the context of our customers.
Contribute. Getting customers to understand the value of their contribution to the long-term health of their project.
Through this highly interactive session, we'll take a trip into the process of building a Drupal website and explore what each stage means to us as developers, site builders, customers, and users.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,660
hello come on I know it's five o'clock

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,670
but bring it up a level a little bit

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,050
here this is your wake up session so you

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,740
guys can go out and drink tonight that's

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,450
my whole purpose that's why I'm here

00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:18,600
anyway you're at Drupal for customers a

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,160
shift in our thinking I'm web Kenny that

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,369
may may have seen me percent before I

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,630
was in London I was in Chicago if those

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,910
of you that made it over there you shot

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,310
nerf darts at me that's who I am talk a

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,309
little bit more about Who I am I started

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,899
in the web in 2002 I was working on cold

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:36,600
fusion back then if you remember that

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,570
language that was fun times I got with

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,030
Drupal in 2007 I join doc we are in 2009

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,710
and about three and a half years later I

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,760
now work with blink reaction a partner

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,770
back ways and a development firm see now

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,850
of course naturally I'll ask what I did

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,320
before technology I did this I looked a

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,899
little bit like this too I mean the hair

00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,430
is different now but I was a carny I

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,500
actually worked in a carnival before I

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,650
the year before i started in technology

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,270
so yeah so why should you care about who

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,860
i am and why should you tweak this

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,950
section if you want to tweet this

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,960
session the hashtag is d4c Saudi the

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,990
number four and see easy enough Drupal

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,400
for customers and you know why would you

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,750
care why would you tweak this session

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,070
why would you pay attention well now i'm

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,619
going to lay a little bit of guilt on

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,450
you and say that today is my two year

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,340
wedding anniversary that i am missing to

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,780
be here in Prague presenting few people

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,840
so can I get a round of applause for

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,840
that

00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,260
and if you really want to shot my wife

00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,400

00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:40,230
go ahead you can all just tweet or

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,230
randomly happy anniversary sample Gail

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,530
anyway so today we'll talk about my

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,560
favorite my favorite topic and as my

00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,270
career has always been a developer but

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,210
always a developer with an eye on

00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,260
customers that's always what I've done

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,540
so in one way of the other I've been

00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:01,300
involved in requirements gathering in

00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,160
some kind of support of customers and

00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,930
now I help customers with their

00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,120
solutions and run a technology team for

00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,710
a delivery company so my whole job while

00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,840
being a coder has always been about my

00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,970
favorite topic customers and they

00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,440
basically say I'm going to pay you and

00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,720
you're going to solve my problem right

00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:22,780
so how many people in here build sites

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:24,660
for free excellent that's fantastic how

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,770
do you how do you keep your lights on

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,040
we'll talk about that later come see me

00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:31,210
later all right but now honestly

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,940
customers are such an important part of

00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:36,400
what we do right users customers there's

00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,020
lots of different words for it you know

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,400
they really are the most important

00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,280
person in your world and even for those

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,670
who build free sites users are your most

00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,880
important people and you know that gets

00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:50,410
forgotten forgotten there's a lot of

00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,560
different types of customers that we

00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,209
work with you know there are what i like

00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,640
to call sort of the technically

00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:00,280
challenged customer all right there's

00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,510
also the know-it-all customer will talk

00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,850
about each of those so the technically

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,709
challenged customer calls you at you

00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,390
know two thirty in the morning and says

00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:09,010
my website won't come up and you say

00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,640
well as your internet cable plugged in

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:15,100
right and they say oh yeah no it isn't

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,540
thanks let me call my IT guy and the

00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,480
know-it-all customer of course is that

00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,430
customer that did computer science 15 20

00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,950
years ago they built a little you know

00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,739
something little screens for a for an

00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,150
ATM machine and now of course they can

00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:31,420
tell you everything that they know about

00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:33,130
UX and how to build websites right but I

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,830
do assert to you that there's one thing

00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,360
that will keep every customer happy no

00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,910
matter what and that is being

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,799
transparent with them all right that is

00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,500
transparency it's the most important

00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,900
thing around what we do I'm a big

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,030
lever in teaching customers I think that

00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,370
too often as developers as technical

00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,990
people we get into sort of this this way

00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,700
all right we get into this way where we

00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:57,010
feel like we know something you don't

00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,590
and so therefore that's job security for

00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:02,080
us but truthfully it's a lot easier to

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:05,590
work with smarter customers so we have

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,270
to make our customer smarter so what

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,459
I've done is I've actually taken time

00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:11,650
sometimes to explain get to a customer

00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:13,480
I've actually explained a database to a

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,190
customer you know to sort of give them

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,480
that edge so that they can feel as

00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,400
though they can have a conversation with

00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:23,200
me and I show them Drupal I do it every

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:26,350
day so today we're going to talk about

00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,360
the Drupal site life cycle okay not the

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,650
technical life cycle so if there are you

00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,840
know if you're expecting to hear about

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,730
hooks in here and libraries and include

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,650
files you should leave now all right

00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,270
we're going to talk about the Drupal

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,040
site life cycle in terms of what it's

00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,919
like to build them all right we're going

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,890
to talk about five stages today selling

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,960
planning building them deploying and

00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,180
then contributing all right I see the

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,919
five of those as basically being the the

00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,300
key five things now under those five

00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:54,010
areas there could be any number of

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,960
subtopics I mean we could talk about

00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,550
sales for an entire session I can talk

00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,030
about dust performance for an entire

00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:03,400
session and I have but first let's talk

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:05,229
about the old way all right the pre the

00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,790
pre open-source way that we use to build

00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:08,650
websites and many websites are still

00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,390
built this way today does anybody

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:14,650
remember this from computer science

00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:16,390
school yeah this is the old sdlc okay it

00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,340
is this concept they also call it

00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,680
waterfall all right it's the process

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,570
where you analyze requirements and you

00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,060
go through and quote and then you do a

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,830
mock-up and then you create it and you

00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,510
staged it and release it then you go

00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,880
back to the beginning to do it again now

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:34,270
what is wrong with this particular

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,710
approach can anyone tell me what happens

00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:40,180
in websites when you build them in

00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:42,040
waterfall no I'll tell you basically

00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,710
software is like childbirth all right

00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,270
you wait nine months for something and

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,979
then the screaming starts all right

00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,249
that's effectively what it's like when

00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:52,069
it's built that way

00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:54,769
alright so and a lot of that is because

00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:56,599
we we sort of we don't know what the

00:05:54,769 --> 00:05:57,979
customer wants when the customer asks

00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:59,659
for it they don't know what the customer

00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:01,009
wants when they asked for it you know

00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,049
they don't even know what they want so

00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:05,599
let's talk through how we can sort of

00:06:03,049 --> 00:06:07,909
break through that a little bit the

00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:10,009
first thing is selling it how do you

00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:12,109
sell Drupal okay how do you sell this

00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:13,609
sort of we all come to drupalcon we know

00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:15,679
we throw down a bunch of money we travel

00:06:13,609 --> 00:06:18,109
from all over the world we love Drupal

00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:19,669
right we bleed blue it's so exciting for

00:06:18,109 --> 00:06:21,379
us to walk through the halls and talk to

00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:22,489
people and meet people but our customers

00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:25,159
they don't really know the inside of

00:06:22,489 --> 00:06:26,329
Drupal so how do you sell it the first

00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:28,249
thing you have to be comfortable with

00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:31,099
before you begin even your first triple

00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:33,499
project is this you're already awesome

00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:35,299
all right you're already excellent

00:06:33,499 --> 00:06:37,610
because you're as as much an assembler

00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:38,659
as you our coder so you know there are

00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,429
some people out there who can write

00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:42,199
custom modules I'm one of them there are

00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:43,669
others who just site builders there are

00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,110
folks who are themed errs there are

00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,429
folks who literally just can assemble

00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,469
modules together and understand

00:06:46,429 --> 00:06:50,119
requirements you know what you have to

00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:51,889
remember in the Drupal space is that

00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:53,449
people are actually or actually this is

00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:55,099
open source in general but they're

00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:56,899
paying for your ability to distill the

00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:58,639
complexity for them that's what they're

00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:59,989
paying for you to do all right yeah

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,849
they're also paying you to write code

00:06:59,989 --> 00:07:03,529
sure they're also paying you to launch

00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:05,449
their site absolutely but they really

00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:08,689
are paying you to it to distill it and

00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:12,279
to make it less complex so you don't

00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:15,079
have to be dreese to be very successful

00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:16,699
you want to stand out from the crowd all

00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:18,399
right by engaging with your customers

00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:20,959
you want to contribute to the community

00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,999
collaborate with everyone around you all

00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:25,759
right and finally you want to be the

00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:27,110
best all right need to attend trainings

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,309
they're already halfway there here are a

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,049
triple con give yourselves a round of

00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:32,149
applause for that yeah you're already

00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,919
halfway there so you're here at

00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:35,689
drupalcon you go to drupal camps you go

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,449
to meet ups you're already sort of

00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:40,279
moving towards being the best soaking up

00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:42,679
as much knowledge as possible in this

00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:44,509
space and you will be it's about as much

00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:46,549
it's actually as much about your

00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:48,529
ambition to build something great as it

00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,969
is your ability to build it that

00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:51,079
actually you know it's called outcome

00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:55,399
visioning we're going to talk about that

00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:57,379
too later all right now it's the quiz

00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:59,599
part of our you're ready for the quiz

00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:02,149
this is the quiz part of our of our

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,180
session so everybody in here knows what

00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,039
the GPL is I

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,199
assume yeah obviously I would hope so

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,930
however we shouldn't be here so let me

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,419
ask you a question and just by show of

00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,430
hands are you forced to redistribute all

00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:18,570
of your drupal code raise your hand if

00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:21,060
it's yes okay can you sell the drupal

00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:24,030
source code with your modifications and

00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:28,530
or the executable raise your hand for

00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:30,330
yes ok can you distribute the GPL code

00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,710
with proprietary code without

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:35,060
distributing the source of the

00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:37,469
proprietary code raise your hand for no

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:40,409
okay see we don't really know GPL hold

00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:42,599
that well let's go back first of all

00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:44,430
you're not ever forced to redistribute

00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,930
your Drupal code that's a no all right

00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,000
so you guys won't it you got that right

00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:50,339
the second one can you sell the Drupal

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,050
source code you absolutely can there are

00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:53,820
many people who have made lots and lots

00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,380
of money because what I what I have

00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,060
dealt with when I built projects for

00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,130
people where it's there the next great

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,330
Facebook right because everybody has the

00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,070
next Facebook there's going to be

00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,140
awesome we're going to have puppies and

00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:06,450
pictures and it's going to be fantastic

00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,770
the first question that I get is well

00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,660
Kenny if you're going to build this with

00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,310
open source what's going to happen six

00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,330
months from now you know when because

00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,130
that's all it's going to take us six

00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,930
months what's going to happen six months

00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:17,940
from now when Microsoft comes to buy my

00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:25,350
idea can I sell this and the answer is

00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:27,440
yes you can there we go all right so the

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,640
good news is this very simple here it is

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,510
when you run your proprietary software

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:35,370
written in PHP Drupal on linux and mysql

00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,200
it does not mean you have to

00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,180
redistribute your proprietary source

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,370
code it just means that should you

00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,839
choose to redistribute it you have to

00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,910
distribute it under the original terms

00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,140
of the GPL that's it so you never have

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,450
to redistribute it you could sell it to

00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,070
five people but if you decide to that's

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,270
when you get into licensing but I want

00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,160
you to remember one very important thing

00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,320
about this session which is I'm not a

00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,029
lawyer all right so if you have

00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,829
questions about your particular project

00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:01,800
you should call your lawyer all right

00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:03,570
they know better than I do so that's

00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,300
licensing all right now the next thing

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:08,579
is to talk about that sort of this is a

00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,079
tough one for people to digest customers

00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:12,180
at least which is the evolution of our

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,490
project our project change is so

00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,140
frequently I used to do support for aqua

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,690
back in the day and I used to joke and

00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,910
I'd say

00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:21,040
doing support for aqua is like being a

00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,540
dog chasing a ball attached to a pickup

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,740
truck you're never actually going to

00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,410
reach the truck but you're always going

00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,850
to stay directly behind it all right and

00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,740
the reason for that is because every

00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,870
single day something in the community

00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,730
changes right views yesterday is not

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,470
what it was it is today there's a new

00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,550
patch there's something new there's

00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,810
something that's going to break that's

00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,370
just how open source is not really

00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,110
Drupal although Drupal certainly seems

00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:42,700
to move at a much faster pace it appears

00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:47,320
not major versions but that's a whole

00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:50,260
separate talk so you really have to tell

00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:52,030
your customers to embrace the change all

00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:55,030
right embrace the change of Drupal and

00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:57,490
you know talk to them about the changes

00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:59,680
and teach them to sort of except the

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,360
fast-moving pace and how do you say that

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,180
you know the good news is there's a

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,710
upside to this which is that because it

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,050
changes so much it means when they

00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:10,180
change their mind and they will you'll

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:12,460
be able to change with it okay they will

00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,980
change their minds obviously three

00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:17,230
months ago they didn't know then what

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,660
they know today so it basically means

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,070
instead of charging maybe fifty thousand

00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,350
dollars for a site you build in 10 weeks

00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,520
maybe you're charging them two thousand

00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,800
dollars a week until the project is done

00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,720
you know there are sort of ways to look

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,950
at that there's fixed price there's time

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,270
of materials there's all sorts of ways

00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,650
to structure it there was a great

00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,810
session earlier today about that I won't

00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,490
go into it but you basically have to

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,170
structure your pricing model around the

00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:43,540
way the Drupal moves and around the way

00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:46,570
that your development shop can move all

00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:49,660
right now let's talk about planning all

00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:52,060
right so this is the dreading dreaded

00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,200
planning stage you know which is how do

00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,100
we know what we're going to build if

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,260
we're going to do those just a little

00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,640
bit at a time what about specs and

00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,790
requirements and how do we get into that

00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:03,640
so the first thing is I'm going to say

00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:06,670
this bold if you're not talking to your

00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,320
customers you are boring them okay you

00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,000
are actually boring your customers when

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,350
you get on the phone when you don't get

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,210
on the phone with them and you let weeks

00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,710
elapsed between conversations as you go

00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,540
off into a hole and build something or

00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,980
plan something you know if you're not

00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,020
comfortable talking to customers you

00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,060
probably should find another job because

00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,890
this is the new breed of developer all

00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,320
right 25 years ago it was different

00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,150
right coders 25 30 years ago they could

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,700
spend all their lives you know at

00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,620
computer basically hacking out cold all

00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,240
day and that's still true to some degree

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,830
I mean there's still some you know

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,570
there's some some people that can do

00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:40,210
that but I think that the more you want

00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,800
to advance in this in this sort of in

00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,180
this business the more you want to

00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,620
advance in web development the more you

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,910
want to advance up your career become a

00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,890
better developer become an architect

00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,210
become and lead but now whatever you're

00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,880
going to do you have to get comfortable

00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:55,690
talking obviously I'm comfortable

00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,670
talking I talk too much but you really

00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:00,130
want to get the conversations down you

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,690
want to record them if you need to you

00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,370
want to reference them when you talk to

00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,320
them again and probably the most

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:07,330
important thing is listen to your

00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,460
customers your customers know what

00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,990
they're talking about all right even

00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,580
though we think they don't they really

00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:17,140
truly do because they know their

00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:20,290
customers right now what usually happens

00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:22,870
when people hear the word planning how

00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:25,690
do you react all right this is usually

00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,340
how most people react to oh we have to

00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,450
plan it all right well we sold this

00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,980
website we're going to have all this

00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,780
money but how what are we going to do

00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,690
how are we going to plan it well here's

00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:36,340
the thing so instead of panicking I am

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,980
going to tell you that you have the

00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,810
greatest planner in the world and you

00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,580
don't have to spend a single nickel on

00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:46,990
anything else you're sitting with it

00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:49,210
right now your brain right your brain is

00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,650
an amazing planner all right it has this

00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,270
little thing which you can look up when

00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:54,730
i'm done to see if I'm talking jazz but

00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,690
I'm actually I'm not this is true you

00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,310
have this little thing in your brain

00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,630
called the reticular filter and it's

00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,670
this little part of your brain basically

00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,990
that when you focus on something it will

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,630
give you all the data that you need

00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:06,670
about that particular item all right so

00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,410
let's test that out right now all right

00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,730
everybody in here just close your eyes

00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,550
bear would be for a second close your

00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:15,250
eyes now tell me where there's red in

00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:17,470
the room spot right in the room and

00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:20,770
you're in you're just in your mind got

00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:24,070
it okay open your eyes all right great

00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:26,560
one more time close your eyes blue where

00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,670
is their blue in the room all right so

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,080
there's more blue in the room then there

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,390
is actually read all right as a

00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,740
proportion of color blue is actually the

00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,420
the color that you probably see the most

00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,730
standing up words in my presentation

00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,680
it's here it's on the carpet right but

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,090
while I was asking you about red blue

00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,020
was there the whole time you just

00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:43,450
weren't looking at blue

00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:45,250
you were looking at red and so what I

00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,900
try to assert to you with that is that

00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,060
when you focus on a particular problem

00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,380
your brain will do the work for you but

00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,770
it's all about actually sitting down to

00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:55,270
focus so we're going to talk about

00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:58,870
something called the natural planning

00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:01,300
model all right the natural planning

00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:03,640
model is consisted of five steps all

00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,920
right you know you could easily probably

00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,380
break these down into words why what how

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,060
organized and action okay that's sort of

00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,190
the natural planning model of how things

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,980
go and sure you know this what I'm

00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,120
talking about this could turn into a

00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,620
specification that you know all these

00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,020
these planning steps that I refer to

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,520
could actually turn into a 25-page spec

00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,200
that you put in front of a developer but

00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,900
how you get to that spec is what's

00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,390
important the first step in the model is

00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,100
to define your purpose and principal why

00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:32,440
are we here why are we building this

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,360
site the immediate answer for most

00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,760
people who get paid by developers is

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,740
money so if that's your motivation fine

00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,300
but really it's why your customer is

00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,600
building the site why are they building

00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,770
it the second is outcome visioning so

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,010
there's a lot of studies out there that

00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:50,230
show that Olympic athletes they actually

00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:51,400
do most of their training visioning the

00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,530
goal that they're going to make before

00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,670
they actually go out and do it all right

00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,230
there are studies that suggests that

00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:58,420
doing that makes them a better athlete

00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,800
and so we're athletes we're code

00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,180
athletes just because we don't all go

00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,290
out running I mean I certainly can't run

00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,970
I took the elevator up and down the

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,890
stairs you know all day to day I don't

00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,450
think I go down the stairs once but I

00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:10,330
still vision when something's going to

00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:12,820
be successful and that's what we have to

00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,890
do the third step is brainstorming all

00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,300
right lean I think brainstorming gets

00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,950
short circuited when we develop because

00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,660
a lot of the times we especially as

00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,850
developers and I do this you know I

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,850
spent a lot of time wondering what's a

00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:26,170
good idea right what's a good idea and

00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,480
automatically my brain shuts down

00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:30,280
because I know deep down I probably

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,200
don't have the you know I think I don't

00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,220
have the capacity for the good idea but

00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,200
the thing is you have to have a lot of

00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,000
bad ideas before you have a lot of good

00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,320
ideas all right so what I would what I

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,300
would encourage you to do to prove that

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,800
theory for yourself is to go back

00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,890
because it's out there and take a look

00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,450
at Drupal one okay go back and look at

00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,770
Drupal one we all know Drupal today it's

00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:50,020
so awesome it's all these api is

00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:52,150
fantastic but go look at the terrible

00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,980
idea that drupal one was and drupal too

00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,819
and drupal three right it was a good

00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,529
idea but

00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:57,879
wasn't executed all that well a lot of

00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:02,169
bad ideas before we got to where we are

00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:03,489
today the fourth step is organizing so

00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:04,990
once you get all that brainstorming done

00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:07,179
you get it all out into the open all

00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,079
right you then have to figure out how

00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:10,299
you're going to organize all those

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,380
thoughts how do you brainstorm you could

00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:13,240
do it any way you want you can use a

00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,829
piece of paper I use a mind mapping

00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,480
software you could do something as easy

00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,470
as popping open Microsoft Word and

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,819
taking an outline there's a lot of

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,289
different ways you could do it but

00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,939
basically the whole exercise I just

00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,829
taught you on blue and red you basically

00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:25,389
do that you think to yourself login

00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:26,679
feature one of the things that go with a

00:17:25,389 --> 00:17:28,779
login feature well going to be to form

00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:30,399
probably to need some theming done right

00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:31,509
although I may need to make sure that

00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:32,620
they don't want it to integrate with

00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:35,919
their external systems that they're a

00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:37,389
big company things like that and the

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,159
last in fifth step it really is to

00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,899
identify the actions that come out of

00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:42,879
that right so once you determine that

00:17:40,899 --> 00:17:45,309
you have to build a theme that's your

00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:46,870
action build a theme you know maybe you

00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:48,190
need to go find a theme first if you're

00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,600
going to build a sub-theme of something

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,070
and it's going to be responsive then

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,019
maybe your first thing is actually going

00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:57,610
out and finding what you're going to use

00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:59,590
to build this so let's have some fun

00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,850
does anybody in air have a website they

00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:06,340
have to build that they haven't started

00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:07,779
yet yeah excellent you want to be a test

00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:11,679
subject for me right here in the third

00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:14,289
row you mind all right just stand up for

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,879
me all right first of all tell us about

00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:22,899
the website good building I'll repeat it

00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:25,090
over the microphone ok so it's an

00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:26,559
e-commerce store yeah all right great

00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:33,639
what's one of the features that you have

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:35,950
to build on that a car shopping cart ok

00:18:33,639 --> 00:18:36,909
so by show of hands and I'll call on you

00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,929
what's the first thing that comes to

00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:40,059
mind when you think about a shopping

00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:44,740
cart go ahead raise your hands everybody

00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:48,879
in this room shopping cart payment

00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:53,110
gateway what else products right what

00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:56,320
else security there we go I knew there

00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,519
was a knock Queen in the room he's

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,330
hiding back there he's actually taller

00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:04,289
than all of you all right security good

00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:06,549
what else what else comes to mind

00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:08,600
usability awesome great we have a

00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:09,620
designer in here so

00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,250
you can sit down you know understand the

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:14,720
whole time I'm sorry but the point being

00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,730
you know we just got four really good

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,230
ideas all right for things in here that

00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:21,380
we have to think about usability

00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:23,060
security products right a payment

00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,680
gateway now we have to go out we have to

00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,300
create actions on those things well

00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,370
payment gateways we've got authorize net

00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,080
got paypal got a lot of different things

00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,310
we could use we could integrate with

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,320
somebody else's system we could build

00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,880
our own if we want it to and then we

00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,320
sort of then we'd identify the actions

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,700
that are based on that right so one of

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,200
the actions involved in choosing a

00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,360
payment gateway you're probably going to

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,160
do some googling you know maybe you're

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,210
gonna hop in IRC and ask what people use

00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,860
maybe you're going to go look at the

00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:50,870
issue queues and see what modules are

00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:52,730
well supported that's what a thing now

00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:54,380
you have to actually build what you said

00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:56,570
you were going to build right so after

00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,460
you've after you planned it and you've

00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,130
sold it now you have to build it all

00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:03,590
right now here's the good thing in

00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:04,880
Drupal we don't have to build everything

00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,640
from the ground up right that's why we

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,860
love this platform but how do you choose

00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,440
what to build when there's so many

00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:14,300
choices right how do you know like today

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,590
I think that this I don't know what the

00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,420
actual statistic is but I know a few

00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,860
that I've seen I can think of at least

00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,990
on the top of my head probably four or

00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,820
five image galleries today in Drupal 7

00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,920
all right I'm sure that there are

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,030
probably 15 or 20 or 30 i don't know how

00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,410
many there are and i want to spit out a

00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,870
statistic but i've seen probably four or

00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,370
five so how do you make the choices

00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:34,340
around which one you're going to use

00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:37,370
right y'all you have a couple of ways to

00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:39,020
do that you can find it by hand you can

00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:41,210
go to drupal.org and you can search

00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,760
drupal org for keywords and you can see

00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:45,500
and see if anything pops up and you can

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,570
find it by accident right you can find

00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,280
it by accident on drupal planet there's

00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:51,260
a feed on Twitter that I subscribe to

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,900
call triple modules that basically will

00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:56,060
every time a module is posted it pops up

00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,290
on the screen what the module is and you

00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,730
know I see it sometimes that if I'm

00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,650
working on something and it pops up that

00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:04,790
sort of happenstance but doesn't always

00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:07,700
happen also the support forums drew in

00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:08,900
drupal org you know they you can see it

00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,120
in the form of questions from other

00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,320
users about their requirements many of

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,790
the cool things I learned about when I

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,710
was first starting in Drupal and Drupal

00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:17,180
five I just got by trolling the forums

00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,650
and seeing how other people did it it's

00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,300
simple enough and in the triple five

00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,760
days we weren't clearly as huge as we

00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,750
are today

00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,340
right I mean that was like you know

00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:26,820
beginning of Drupal 5 not nearly as many

00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:29,340
people the other way is a triple

00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,630
showcase this will be posted by the way

00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,910
after and I'll have all these links for

00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:34,410
you but the Drupal showcase is another

00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:36,030
place you know these are places these

00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,320
are case studies effectively around

00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:39,480
sites that have been built with Drupal

00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,680
you know not invented here something

00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,480
that we took the trees talked about that

00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,940
the keynote same is true when we build

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,500
sites right i mean we we don't really we

00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,750
don't want to go through we don't want

00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:53,400
to go through building a thing custom

00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:55,050
again now you have to evaluate okay you

00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,850
found the perfect module this has

00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:59,460
happened to me many times i thought oh I

00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,690
need I need flowplayer I need the flow

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,940
player in my site i found the flow

00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,980
player module I'm so excited I didn't

00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,350
get a 404 when I went to the link page

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,660
loads oh there hasn't been a commit in

00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:11,940
sixty eight weeks all right and there's

00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:14,820
5,000 open issues in the queue what do I

00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,340
do now all right here's how you can

00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:20,430
basically give some general sense around

00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:22,770
how this works if the last updated date

00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:24,990
of the latest release is several months

00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:26,310
in the past then it could indicate a few

00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:28,260
things it could indicate that there's a

00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:30,780
lack of maintainer activity right and

00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,430
interest in the module it's possible it

00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,020
can also mean you found an example of a

00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,670
completely perfect module and nothing

00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,160
needs to be done right but that's not

00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:40,590
usually the case so the other thing you

00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,060
can look at is usage statistics you can

00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,470
go look and see all right well here's a

00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,030
modular really hasn't been used in a

00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,340
long time or has been committed to it a

00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,900
long time so you go and then you see

00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,830
well how many people are using it you

00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,330
know there are actually some really

00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,010
excellent modules out there that are

00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,020
really rock solid that are being used on

00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:56,460
tens of thousands of sites but haven't

00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,590
seen a commit in six months that's okay

00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:02,040
you know so it's all about sort of

00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:04,980
evaluating in that way this is an

00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,290
article that never really gets old this

00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,580
one here it's sort of you know how to

00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:12,300
choose modules for a Drupal installation

00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:15,600
I was written by Angie so it's really a

00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,770
great great one also when you're

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,890
building you know you have to be honest

00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:21,780
about design looks matter of course you

00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:23,220
know in and it is in a design now

00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,960
whether you're a designer or not that's

00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,070
fine you know it's all about negotiating

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,390
with the customers on what they're

00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,820
willing to pay for what resources you

00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:31,260
have what resources they have a lot of

00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,420
people will come at you and say we've

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,130
got a really rock solid designer and

00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:36,360
he really wants to learn drupal so he's

00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,470
going to do that on this project and

00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,120
you're just going to build the modules

00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:45,180
for him right and we all know how that

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:47,610
typically goes not all that well so what

00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:49,680
I suggest is you know certainly we have

00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:52,620
this concept in development of fixed

00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:55,590
costs right we get an RFP from a

00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,790
customer and it's 22 pages long and it's

00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,810
got all these requirements we have to do

00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,670
and we basically have to come up with a

00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:03,240
magic number right we have to get soap

00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:04,890
it's going to take us a hold on five

00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,250
thousand hours or I can just make it up

00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:11,070
and you know it's based on past history

00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:12,690
based on past experience obviously it's

00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:15,360
based on past numbers there's lots of

00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:17,160
ways we do that but in the end really

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,140
you should iterate and build it agile

00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,360
even if the project is a fixed cost now

00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:23,160
how can you do that you know how can you

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,340
have a conversation with customers that

00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:29,070
says well you've asked for these 15

00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,200
features okay and I can build these 15

00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:33,390
features it's going to take us 25 hours

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,160
to do that or if you're willing to

00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,410
sacrifice this feature and that feature

00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:40,320
i can give you the five-star module and

00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:41,730
we'll do it out of the box right so this

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,670
is where conversations with customers

00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:46,260
come in you have to know your work you

00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:48,810
have to know drupal you have to be able

00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:51,090
to talk confidently about that and so

00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:52,320
that's why the learning that you do when

00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,000
you first start off in this kind of

00:24:52,320 --> 00:25:01,710
development really cannot be understated

00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:03,510
it's so important then you have to

00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,530
launch it all right there's always

00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:06,270
there's the sort of the launching

00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:07,770
process and you have to scale it if

00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,840
you're going to do sites for any any

00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:12,570
large business you effectively have to

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,840
scale the you have to scale the site at

00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:17,550
some point right and people might say

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,870
well why does scaling matter I mean well

00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,070
I guess we could all say we all know why

00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:23,310
scaling matt is my customers sometimes

00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:24,300
be like why does scaling matter and the

00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:26,010
truth is that we know when people

00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:33,840
consume information they become bored

00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:36,840
very easily all right and see what I

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,610
mean like it's a very boring process or

00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,650
just sort of sit there and wait and read

00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:42,840
and do those sort of things now what

00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:44,820
happens if we don't scale websites right

00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,620
what if we don't care about caching and

00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,320
we just throw a sign out the door no one

00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:52,660
cares about ski

00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:54,910
what usually happens all right the site

00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:57,190
goes up in horrible flames and goes down

00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:58,450
right so let's talk a little bit about

00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,710
caching I'm going to keep it a little

00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:01,360
high level because this isn't a super

00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,260
technical session but I do want to talk

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,060
a little bit about some of the things

00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:07,210
you can do off the shelf to help you

00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:09,250
with with this stuff so caching comes in

00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:10,690
a lot of flavors in Drupal all right I

00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,730
think that it's become a lot more

00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:13,690
important in Drupal 6 in Drupal 7 as

00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,670
we've been exposed to the enterprise

00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,740
more in Drupal five maybe not as much

00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:20,710
although one of these modules have been

00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:23,140
around since four so the first one is

00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:25,570
Drupal's default database cash right

00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,770
that's those tables for those developers

00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:29,140
in the room you've seen these they have

00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:30,940
the cash prefix and you know those

00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:33,970
that's basically you're you're caching

00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:36,010
system interestingly the only one that

00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,420
actually gets affected by the only one

00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:39,010
that gets served to your users really is

00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,360
cache block and cache page everything

00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:43,570
else is all caching for the system

00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,620
itself when you turn off this is like

00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,970
one of those annoying things as

00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,830
developers you notice like when you turn

00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:49,390
off caching and you can yet you still

00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,770
three things that are cached that's

00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,000
because there are other caches in your

00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,380
system that are still working because

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,350
they're just to make Drupal faster a

00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:58,720
little bit and can somebody tell me in

00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:00,490
here if your tactical and you know those

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,410
tables there's a particular table that

00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:06,100
actually is not a cash can somebody tell

00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:08,080
me which one that is so it's cash form

00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,580
right so people see cash for when they

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,680
think that's a cash it actually isn't

00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:13,750
it's what's called a state machine so

00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,120
it's what prevents it's what enables you

00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:18,550
actually to go from page 3 of a form to

00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,590
page four and not lose your place it's a

00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:24,010
it's an ill named table in the Drupal

00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:25,630
space the next thing is an object cache

00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,920
this is really technical but I'll just

00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:28,930
you know I'll sort of leave it to you to

00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,370
go research this this is so this is one

00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,180
of those questions you want to ask if

00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:33,430
you're building a high availability

00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:35,050
website or you're building a site for a

00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:37,180
large customer you want to ask does your

00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:38,770
host have right so one of the things

00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:40,990
that you would be asking is does your

00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:42,490
host have a PC it's not marked up here

00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:45,010
but it is something that it should be

00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:46,900
you know looked into so it's a pc if you

00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:49,300
were taking notes and that's an opcode

00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,740
cash alright effectively that makes PHP

00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,470
run faster it's the easiest way to say

00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:55,660
it memcache is a little bit different

00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,100
that's an object cache and so what

00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,780
memcache does is it takes all those

00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,730
fancy tables I just told you about and

00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,440
it basically gets rid of those

00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,790
and puts everything into the system ram

00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,799
and obviously things are going to move

00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:07,059
faster between the CPU and the RAM then

00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:09,250
they are between the CPU and the

00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:10,809
database so again you don't really have

00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,220
to know what it does all you really have

00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:14,440
to know if you're more on the business

00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,210
side is does your hosting have this or

00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:20,890
are we offering a hosting package that

00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:21,790
has this then for the hackers in the

00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,929
room where the folks who are actually

00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,280
doing the implementation there's

00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:25,510
something called a static file cache

00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,559
this is one of my favorite modules

00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:29,230
actually and I think it gets sort of

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,549
understated in the world of varnish and

00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:33,610
reverse proxies which I'll talk about

00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:35,860
next but this actually can be used with

00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:37,650
a varnish you know this this this is a

00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,880
really powerful module called boost and

00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:41,440
what boost does is it basically goes

00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,970
through your database our goes through

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,080
you go through your database pics all

00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:46,750
the things that should be cached and

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,429
then creates HTML copies of them right

00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,990
it goes through when it just creates

00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:52,390
copies in folders in your files

00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:53,919
directory so it's a very useful module

00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,809
and I've been using it for three

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,130
versions now now people will say oh wait

00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:59,230
a minute Kenny I have varnish so who

00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:01,690
cares about boost well the thing is that

00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:03,910
boost actually a lot can have a much

00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:06,340
longer lifetime than varnish can so

00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,780
let's save our nut can varnish can have

00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,280
an endless lifetime but the point is if

00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:11,260
you want to set your varnish cash to be

00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,299
let's say sixty seconds but you want

00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:15,340
your the cash underneath it till to

00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:16,990
persist longer you can do that and you

00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,179
can use all sorts of fancy modules up

00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:21,370
there like cash actions and rules and

00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:22,840
all these things to say because there's

00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:24,940
always a marketing person that says I

00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,590
can't use caching I'm sorry but when I

00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,630
write a blog post it must be up

00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:30,280
immediately all right while the good

00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:32,110
news is there is a solution for that

00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,580
problem okay there is a solution for

00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,260
that problem and it's called cash

00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:37,780
actions it's a very easy module to

00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:39,669
implement and effectively it says when

00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:41,350
something is updated clear the cache for

00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:42,850
this one node right and then they get

00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:44,410
their fresh blog post and the site

00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,640
doesn't come to their needs I mean

00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,690
sometimes if you want to just be a jerk

00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,640
you can say all right I'll turn off

00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:49,660
caching then I think you know but you're

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,590
all you're gonna get a call at two in

00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:56,530
the morning so and then there's a big

00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:58,360
boys right or there's the big people to

00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:01,480
keep it to keep it up androgynous but

00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:04,780
there's a barn 'ish squid engine X

00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,520
Apache proxy Akamai I mean I can go on

00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,720
forever what you know this that was the

00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,549
other with a lime in the name i can

00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,200
think of it but there's these are the

00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:13,240
proxy caches these are like you know

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,419
clusters of machines or machines or

00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,249
servers that are

00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:19,279
software that is entirely powered to do

00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:21,230
caching now a reverse proxy and a CDN

00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,779
are a little different absolutely but

00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:25,159
believe it or not in most in akamai's

00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:26,899
default configuration it's really

00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:28,070
nothing more than varnish with 50,000

00:30:26,899 --> 00:30:30,379
servers that's it's really the same

00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:32,749
thing and what these do is they sit in

00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:34,609
front of your website and they basically

00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:36,529
take traffic instead of sending it back

00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:38,809
to the web server so it's a really good

00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:40,929
you know it's a really good way to to

00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:43,220
have a high availability website and

00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:45,440
there are a lot of hosts out there today

00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,549
that already have this stuff so you

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,019
don't really have to think about that

00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:49,429
right now I don't work for them anymore

00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:50,960
but I do believe that one of the

00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:52,639
greatest hosting platforms out there is

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,960
aqua cloud you can disagree me if you

00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:56,720
want we'll fight all day afterwards

00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,340
that's fine but but I do think that's

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,379
great Pantheon is also another excellent

00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:02,119
proud project all right also a really

00:31:00,379 --> 00:31:04,669
great product that you can get and these

00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:06,470
are already built to scale okay they

00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:08,690
already have all the things I just

00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,859
mentioned and the kitchen sink all right

00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:11,480
so you don't really have to worry too

00:31:09,859 --> 00:31:12,710
much about what you're at what's your

00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,749
code is going to do once it gets to

00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:16,789
production once it gets the stage is it

00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:17,869
kind of scale the answer is yes so if

00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:19,309
your customers willing to spend the

00:31:17,869 --> 00:31:20,450
money it's out there if they're if

00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:22,850
they're not willing to spend the money

00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:25,100
and this happens right I assure you

00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:28,100
there are tons of ways to squeeze every

00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,659
little piece that you can out of the

00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,429
hosting before you actually have to get

00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:33,320
into a multi availability setting there

00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:34,909
really are you know there's all sorts of

00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,580
ways you can do it you can layer boost

00:31:34,909 --> 00:31:39,169
and varnish and memcache and a PC and

00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,850
every other caching technology you want

00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:42,289
and quite honestly as long as you're not

00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,820
getting like you know thousands of hits

00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:45,259
per minute you'll stand up you know

00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,480
Drupal can do a lot of really powerful

00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:51,139
things like I'm a famous guy right you

00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,879
know me i'm famous no all right well my

00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:54,259
website gets like you know i mean it's

00:31:52,879 --> 00:31:56,899
it's a lot of traffic my website at

00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:59,119
least 25 hits a month and 23 of them are

00:31:56,899 --> 00:32:01,369
my mother but the truth is the hosting

00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:02,899
that i'm on is a little shared hosting

00:32:01,369 --> 00:32:04,730
but i have my sights set up in such a

00:32:02,899 --> 00:32:06,590
way that if i do some tweet that's like

00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:08,090
so super awesome that it gets like tons

00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:10,399
of retweets and everybody's on my blog I

00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:11,929
can handle it you know I can handle now

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,639
I can handle it to a point you know

00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:14,749
obviously i only pay about 20 bucks a

00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:16,460
month of that hosting because i'm cheap

00:32:14,749 --> 00:32:18,259
you know and at some point i would have

00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,450
to upgrade but the point is you can

00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:22,730
squeeze an awful lot of you know and i

00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:24,200
think that i think what we get to to do

00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:25,879
you know and i'll come off this in a

00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,650
second but i think what we end up doing

00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:30,110
all too often is

00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:31,550
hmm as developers or as tactical people

00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:33,710
i should say as people who are in the

00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,590
technical field we tend to think about

00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:37,700
scale before scale is even necessary

00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:40,940
right how many times have we thought

00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,990
about this idea and said huh if you get

00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,060
mentioned on Oprah you're going to be

00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:47,060
it's going to be over you know I mean

00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:48,650
we're gonna do that you know sites don't

00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:50,270
actually blow up overnight that's a

00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:52,220
fairy tale they don't actually usually

00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:54,170
do that and I've worked on a lot of

00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,880
sites and they usually ramp you can tell

00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:57,860
when it's coming sometimes it happens

00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,870
but sometimes you know but most the time

00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,430
it doesn't you know and most of the

00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:02,570
businesses out there they know when

00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:04,250
they're going to be on CNN because

00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:10,580
they're all watching so you'll know

00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:12,230
ahead of time I think probably one of

00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:14,540
the more challenging conversations to

00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:18,350
have with customers is around

00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:20,390
contribution okay they talked about how

00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:22,780
you know why should I pay you to

00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:25,790
contribute to the open source project or

00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:27,800
you know why should my ideas become part

00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:30,920
of the drupal source project open source

00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:32,930
project drupal and a lot of you know

00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,820
what i like to tell the story of IBM is

00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:37,250
everybody every windows IBM of course

00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,900
right worldwide company they did

00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:40,190
something 20 years ago called the Linux

00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,950
Technology Center is anybody in here

00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:44,870
heard of it by show of hands great so

00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:46,700
what they did is this huge company okay

00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:47,750
is they made an investment they knew

00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,880
that they were gonna they were going to

00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:51,590
use Linux in their organization and

00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,270
actually today Okwe does something like

00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:54,980
this they have called Oct oh but it's

00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:57,110
very similar and effectively what they

00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:59,690
did was and they brought into their

00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:01,310
organization all the best linux core

00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:02,990
developers and they paid them full time

00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:05,510
to work on linux they made an investment

00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:07,880
in open source and IBM at the time that

00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:09,230
they did this was dying right they were

00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,880
on their way up because they were part

00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:12,560
they worse they were early part of the

00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,179
day their pcs weren't really very good

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,770
and there was a lot of other competitors

00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:18,350
out there that were sort of edging them

00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:20,210
out and by investing in open source

00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:22,970
today they are what they are one of the

00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:24,950
world leaders in an open source if not

00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:26,390
the world leader really you know in

00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:28,100
terms of what they produce and what they

00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:29,570
give to people so that's a fun story to

00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,370
tell you can look it up on Wikipedia or

00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,870
and you can tell your customers that but

00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:34,760
also you know there's an investment that

00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:36,409
they make in the future of their product

00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,659
by contributing back to Drupal that's an

00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:41,400
easy conversation to have right it's

00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:42,630
easy to say okay well all we

00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,330
he was concern with this little piece

00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:47,640
you know and here's the thing you can

00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:49,410
believe that the more that they have to

00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,000
come to you for work the more money

00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:52,560
you're going to make but the truth is

00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,180
the more that they have to come to you

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,220
for every little thing the more you're

00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:57,360
going to annoy each other ok that's

00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,520
what's gonna happen like I have clients

00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,710
today that I've had for you know I have

00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,900
like a guy that I used to work with five

00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:05,250
years ago who to this day I still deal

00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,750
with he still sends me emails once in a

00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,950
while and I'm the kind of guy cuz I'm

00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,240
like always in development so I like

00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:10,860
something new and fresh and you know

00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,450
whatever I'm the kind of guy that like

00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,920
doesn't want customers around that long

00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:15,660
okay like I don't like him around five

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,280
or ten years I know I'm like I'm a CEOs

00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,050
worst nightmare but truthfully that's

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,580
kind of how I am I like to build it and

00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,840
move on right now I'm a technologist

00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,900
that's what I like to do the next shiny

00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,340
bright thing is my new thing and so what

00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,020
I tend to when I tend to have

00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:30,120
conversations with customers I sort of

00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,740
Center it around you know if we release

00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,570
this into the community then you will

00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,700
have more developers working on this for

00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:38,700
free and customers love the word free

00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,050
right and so you have to explain that to

00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,780
them you have to explain that process

00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:45,120
because ultimately one person cannot do

00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:49,200
it all all right I mean we can't just

00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:50,430
have sort of you know 1 1020 what did

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,520
they say today in the keynote that it

00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:56,220
was 1700 people who contributed to

00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:59,280
Drupal 8 is that what I heard yeah so

00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:01,200
1700 people right that's not enough it's

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,390
not enough we just heard from drinks

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,950
this morning that Drupal 8 will be ready

00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:07,290
when it's ready but he estimates it'll

00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:09,090
be early 2014 I don't know if anybody of

00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,850
you were at the keynote last year at

00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:13,350
this time but it was supposed to be when

00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:16,380
this year now we should have already had

00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:18,270
it and so so clearly and that's okay I

00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:21,150
mean open source moves a little slow but

00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:23,490
in order to in order to move it faster

00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:24,870
he said probably a fantastic quote this

00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,400
morning about being I can't even quote

00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:28,170
it directly but about you know we can

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,970
move quicker as one as one and we move

00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:32,730
further as a group on my paraphrasing

00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:34,020
but the truth is when it comes to open

00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,970
source when it comes to models when it

00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,890
comes to sustainability of a customer's

00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:39,540
product they have to understand that

00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,010
open source process so you have to

00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:43,770
understand that open source process you

00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:45,750
have to live it and when that doesn't

00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:47,310
work there's really only other that's

00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:50,160
really only other one of the way you can

00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:52,470
do it you have to beg plead prove and

00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,600
bribe alright that's really all you can

00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:55,180
do all right or basically stay up at

00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,950
night

00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,940
tripping on your own time okay that's

00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,770
effectively what you have to do

00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:02,859
sometimes get paid to do it so you have

00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:04,690
to do it on your own all right all right

00:37:02,859 --> 00:37:06,339
so this wasn't meant to be a real long

00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,329
session I was only meant to be about 40

00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:08,650
minutes it looks like I'm a couple

00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:10,270
minutes under so i will open up the

00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:15,970
floor sure a lot of you have customers

00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:21,640
right now anybody have questions this is

00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:24,130
brilliant no questions no none yes all

00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,510
right that's I mean not yes and I'd love

00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,770
to answer them but I've never had a

00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,420
session without questions before you

00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:30,339
know why this isn't a very tactical

00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,809
session so if I'd had a tactical session

00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:33,400
everybody would have the mic challenging

00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:35,650
my whole technical thing in my point of

00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,270
view anyway so thank you very much for

00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:39,849
coming to the session I hope it was

00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:41,770
somewhat enjoyable and if you liked it

00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:43,329
by all means tweet go fill out a survey

00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:44,829
let me know what you did like what you

00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:46,450
didn't like what I left out all that

00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:49,170
good stuff I have a good time in Prague

00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:49,170
