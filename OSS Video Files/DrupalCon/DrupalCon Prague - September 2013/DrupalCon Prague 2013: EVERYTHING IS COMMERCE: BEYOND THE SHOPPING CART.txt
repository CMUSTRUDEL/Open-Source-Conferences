Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: EVERYTHING IS COMMERCE: BEYOND THE SHOPPING CART
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	We're not just talking about a shopping cart any more...Commerce is broader than you think. It's transactions. Information. Connection. It's taking control of how people interact with a site and optimizing it so that visitors and site owners both get the maximum value - even when no payment is made.

All sites participate in Commerce of some sort. The exchange of ideas is just as important as the exchange of money. Long-time Drupal users in government, education and more are adding Commerce to their sites in increasing numbers. There are so many applications for Commerce, and Drupal Commerce was built to discover them. You should be thinking about Commerce with every project.

Commerce Guys has been building a cohesive set of tools to help everyone in the Drupal community make Commerce a part of their practice. But a tool is only helpful if you know about it. Learn about the current tools (Commerce Kickstart, Commerce Marketplace, Commerce Platform, Commerce Mobile) and discover their roadmaps.

In this session, experts from Commerce Guys and some special guests will show you how Drupal Commerce is a competitive framework for high profile eCommerce projects and how Commerce Guys can help you win large eCommerce bids.

cart na drupal commerce been with

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:28,230
commerce guys since 2009 and one of the

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,000
few original US Commerce guys remaining

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,700
so it's a little badge of honor they

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,870
that's right but we're happy to have new

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:40,140
ones so following the the Opera theme we

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:43,920
missed it but I heard that went on in

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:47,039
the first session Ryan and I are going

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,800
to do a duet here so we did this at a

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,500
drupal camp in Austin a few months ago

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,260
worked well we kind of bring two

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,379
different perspectives to to open source

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:01,199
the commerce to commerce guys to build a

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:07,229
romantic comedy exactly you're pursuing

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:09,830
me yeah I'm fairly new to Congress guys

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:12,659
i've been there here for six months

00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:16,860
prior to that I was at magento for four

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:19,259
years so I know Commerce well might open

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,920
source even better than an open source

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:25,350
for about six years and really excited

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,810
about the opportunity to do commerce

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,479
right in the Drupal world so that's what

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,610
we're going to talk about just a quick

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,130
for those who may not know Commerce guys

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,710
were the creators and experts behind

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,640
Drupal commerce we're getting close to

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:44,549
60 60 people we're multinational in

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:49,320
Paris and ann arbor michigan and in the

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:54,180
UK or vc-backed and we're growing and

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:56,729
looking for for good talent so what

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,590
we're going to talk about today again

00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:59,850
everything is commerce it's kind of a

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,640
theme that we've been has been

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:07,770
percolating with in commerce guys for a

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:10,679
while when we are competing against

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,420
commerce the big commerce players who

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,480
offer a great shopping car

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:18,209
functionality and customers want to know

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,370
feature function how do you compare we

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:22,650
scratch our heads and we go well you're

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,450
missing the point you know it's not

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,220
about feature function I mean that's

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,380
important but when you get down to and

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,819
you compare all the commerce solutions

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,920
that are out there they're all about the

00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:33,569
same even drupal commerce we can all do

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,670
stuff and and commerce is really

00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:37,470
becoming a very kind of normalized

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,440
utility it's not about that it's about

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:44,519
other more important things that Drupal

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:47,790
really has the opportunity to leverage

00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,800
and be big and really mapped to the

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,810
major trends happening today in commerce

00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,450
so we're going to talk about that future

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:57,209
of Commerce is really changing and we

00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,910
see it as Commerce should exist

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:03,959
everywhere not just at the at the store

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:06,470
where a customer buys or some whatever

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,850
it is they check out and they leave

00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:13,049
that's not what the future of Commerce

00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:14,540
is going to look like information social

00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:17,519
connections are going to be increasingly

00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:24,420
important and they're going to be in key

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:26,790
influencers to what people buy with all

00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,459
of the commerce platforms that are out

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,410
there some complex some simple it's

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,620
gotten really easy for people to sell

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:37,140
online and when it becomes really easy

00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:40,549
to sell online it's harder for merchants

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:43,440
to differentiate and so another

00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:46,680
important trend here is the the

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,290
importance of merchandising really

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,600
targeting and personalizing the message

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:56,359
and you know the bottom line here is

00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,799
that Drupal is ideally positioned to win

00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:01,019
you know it's a native solution that

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,019
delivers content community and commerce

00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:06,900
you'll hear that theme a lot if you

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:10,549
listen to aquia they are sending a much

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:13,850
stronger message as well when I talk to

00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:17,549
system integrators both magento and

00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:19,459
drupal commerce integrators particularly

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:22,049
the magenta ones they tell me I'm

00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:23,970
finding more and more opportunities that

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:24,510
I can't compete with with Magento

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,390
because

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:30,060
they're highly content oriented and so

00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:32,600
these are the kind of the key themes and

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,800
we're going to be talking about today so

00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,750
three trends that are really changing

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:42,360
Commerce is going to be the bulk of our

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:45,660
conversation here and really how Drupal

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,960
is ideally positioned to win the first

00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,930
is contextual commerce so creating this

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:57,150
rich digital experience this kind of

00:04:51,930 --> 00:05:00,300
experiential journey for a user coupled

00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,970
with engaging social connection

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,240
connection is really going to drive

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:07,950
buying decisions more and more

00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,740
merchandising you know being able to

00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,600
target users and personalize the message

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,250
is going to become increasingly

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,860
important and then the idea of Commerce

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,050
anywhere really kind of the essence of

00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,570
our our talk today commerce everywhere

00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,030
it's fitting in and enabling commerce

00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,470
not plopping down a big store and taking

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,380
over and then trying to integrate with

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,240
the store it should be seamless what I

00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,370
think that with these trends the reason

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,430
I asked at the beginning is anybody here

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:37,740
actually actually selling Drupal

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,600
commerce is because within the drupal

00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,720
commerce community we as developers

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,630
aren't really focused on and

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,830
communicating about these things but

00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,710
these are these are the things that

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,150
we're having to compete against or

00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,340
promote our software as solving when it

00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:57,210
comes to actually selling the solution

00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:59,130
to a new merchant so you know yes this

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,720
this talk is aimed more at the sort of

00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,730
like how do you position commerce in

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,230
Drupal specifically against the

00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,700
competitors to grow your e-commerce

00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:09,630
practice but also how can we as

00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:11,040
developers kind of not miss the not miss

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,110
the forest for the trees while we're

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,570
sort of focused on into the API

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:18,300
integrations and views field handlers

00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:20,070
and the like how can we actually create

00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,570
the modules in solutions that will

00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,340
communicate merchandising and

00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,730
recommendations and so on and so forth

00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:28,050
to the end-user otherwise you know

00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,880
Drupal will not be able to sort of

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,950
elevate itself to play against the

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,690
people that do this messaging like the

00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:36,660
Hybris and demand where companies of the

00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:39,950
world so yeah no great great point Ryan

00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,240
um you know I think a lot of this is

00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:44,910
intended to help everyone who is focused

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,060
on Commerce bring thought leadership to

00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:50,220
your customers when you get asked you

00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,530
know how does from a feature comparison

00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,870
how does drupal commerce compared to

00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:57,000
magento I hate that question because

00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,370
that's not the point yes point is we all

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,930
do 400 things like there's checkboxes it

00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,910
proves it to you right now and you could

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,160
say look we could spend days and days

00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,780
doing that check box you know what we'd

00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,470
find they're all about the same and

00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:12,150
getting turning it around to what's

00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,500
really important and getting your

00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,810
customer to think about what's really

00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:21,420
important I think will separate you from

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:24,000
the competition so contextual commerce

00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:26,640
here is really about promoting and

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,040
selling within the context of whatever

00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,890
it is whatever it is you're doing

00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,240
whether it's a picture of video document

00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,740
you're reading a blog you're reading

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:40,350
it's it's enabling commerce anywhere I

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:42,480
have a just a couple of examples here

00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:45,000
also we also call this buying in the

00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,150
moment you know it's sometimes we know

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,500
exactly what we want to buy and we find

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:52,530
the store and find the product and we

00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,810
buy it but many times we buy things when

00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:57,030
we've never had the intention to buy

00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:58,320
that's why my wife no longer sends me to

00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,630
the grocery store cuz always come home

00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:07,410
with a six-pack of some crap here that i

00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:09,000
bought in the moment hey and i just want

00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,220
to show a couple of examples here these

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,940
are very simple examples but you know

00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:17,669
images here where you know you can

00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:20,850
actually find information about products

00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:24,150
and purchase oh I'm sorry that means i

00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:26,690
need to move this make your direction

00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,690
there we go

00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:41,930
sorry guys so images here where these

00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:45,140
can opportunities to buy and simply pop

00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:50,410
up within the context of what it is I'm

00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:53,959
looking at it can be more complex

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:57,890
involving videos actually I have that

00:08:53,959 --> 00:09:00,950
one and to be clear this is not Drupal

00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:04,130
unfortunately this is you said a Finnish

00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:07,640
company kiosk yeah it's a finnish

00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:17,529
company called kiosk that does some very

00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:17,529
interesting things but here's a video

00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:27,760
which i need to start and this is a

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,760
Crocs if anyone's familiar with Crocs

00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:36,860
but within the context of the video you

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,880
know I can say well I like those shoes

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:43,459
and you know we find out more about

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:48,170
those and even buy them within the

00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:51,800
context of the video so as a user and

00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:55,459
we're all users we all buy things I knew

00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:58,279
intuitively that that rich content the

00:09:55,459 --> 00:10:00,380
experience connecting with my friends or

00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:04,180
people I respect really influenced the

00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:07,250
way I bought we all know that really

00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,260
getting examples and this is one of the

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:14,390
things that really sent it home to me

00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:17,540
one other example here is you know for

00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:20,240
instance somebody buys some some shoes

00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,860
or some boots in this case and like some

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,500
and wants to share it with their friends

00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:29,060
on Facebook everyone sharing things on

00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:31,490
Facebook but in this example you can

00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,079
actually you can actually buy these your

00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,440
friend tells you hey i just bought these

00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:38,810
and i love them and you know i can buy

00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,550
them right there from within Facebook so

00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:42,800
think about the opportunity for a

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:46,010
merchant to

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,050
sell something to a user who likes that

00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:51,080
product and who's now going to share it

00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:53,480
with their social network you know just

00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,930
examples lots of them so let me get back

00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,930
to

00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:08,029
the presentation here so for me that

00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,820
really kind of cemented it made a little

00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:13,399
more interesting the other trend here is

00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:18,950
that the amount of information is really

00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:21,200
growing at an exponential rate and and

00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:24,529
consumers are looking for more

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:29,600
information to make their decisions they

00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:32,480
they really use that and finally you

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,810
know content delivered within the buying

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,670
process so content and those social

00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,250
connections they're all really key

00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:42,709
influencers let's look quickly at you

00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,750
know typical buying by buying journey

00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:48,080
right this is these the key processes

00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:52,130
you have a need you do a little research

00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:53,990
you do what they call risk alleviation

00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,510
you know is this product better than

00:11:53,990 --> 00:12:00,350
that one and finally you know you

00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:01,490
purchase you evaluate at the end you

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,290
know whether you liked it or not that's

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:07,370
a typical buying journey again most

00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:08,990
commerce platforms bring you ultimately

00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:13,339
to a store will you check out and leave

00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:18,110
the site if we look at this a little in

00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:20,630
deeper detail we see that obviously and

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:22,970
this isn't profound but I'm kind of

00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:25,100
speaking the obvious he said finding the

00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,680
need and doing the research is all about

00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,600
content and delivering that content to

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,570
the user when that user wants it to

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,400
answer their questions and it's all

00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,260
about as they do research and determine

00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,450
whether this product is better than the

00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,520
other it's all about connections whether

00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:42,980
it's their friends or or maybe people

00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,740
that are like them and so content and

00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:49,610
connections are really really key to

00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:51,440
driving the buying decision and and not

00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:53,089
only do they influence buying decision

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,420
but they create a level of trust and

00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:59,450
credibility that that makes me as a user

00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:03,290
comfortable with what I'm buying so

00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:05,779
let's look at how and the point is I

00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:08,060
can't Commerce occur anywhere we'll talk

00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:11,000
about that a little bit later let's look

00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:12,500
at how most commerce platforms provide

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,560
their solution they provide their

00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,339
solution with really the store at the

00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,220
center

00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:20,600
and they connect either they provide or

00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,459
they integrate with best-of-breed

00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,850
solutions to provide lots of other

00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:29,209
functionality but some of that

00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:31,339
functionality is content some of that

00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:33,860
functionality is social connections and

00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:35,360
they treat those as just one of many

00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:40,759
many solutions and they're loosely

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:43,490
connected it creates because information

00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:48,949
about the user is in multiple places it

00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:52,550
creates complexity that is unnecessary

00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:55,790
and it also creates duplication data and

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:58,009
ultimately cost more and they're not

00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:02,120
leveraging all that they know about that

00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:03,769
user and ultimately what I believe is

00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,839
that e-commerce solutions today are

00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:08,629
becoming more of a commodity because

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,420
they are focused solely on the shopping

00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:13,579
cart solely on that store rather than

00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:16,029
all the other things that are more

00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:19,490
important leading up to a consumer

00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:22,160
making a decision to buy I think to it

00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:24,559
to a certain degree even the the hosted

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,019
services are still sort of in that that

00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:29,629
space from Shopify to Etsy to ebay it's

00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:32,569
I mean most as platforms aren't offering

00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:34,670
you the ability to communicate

00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:36,259
effectively with your customers or to

00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,639
even build any sort of community around

00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:40,370
them at all it's more like you're

00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:41,480
tapping into a bigger community but

00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:44,089
still like the service that you're

00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,620
actually paying for is the shopping cart

00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:48,199
and then for everything else you're kind

00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:52,160
of left on your own that's exactly right

00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:57,920
very few are have any strong commitment

00:14:52,160 --> 00:15:01,689
to CMS and the content side so what we

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:05,449
believe is the the major trend in

00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:07,550
commerce is having the content solution

00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:09,529
in the middle the content really should

00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:12,860
be driving Commerce and that's why we

00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:15,949
say content-driven Commerce and of

00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,990
course the social connections and the

00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:19,639
ability to conduct transactions should

00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:22,279
be part of that core they should all be

00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:24,889
intertwined into a single seamless

00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:28,189
solution which is what Drupal can

00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:29,699
provide here and you know a good example

00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:31,769
of what simplicity

00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:36,600
allows you to do it just reduces

00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:40,019
complexity duplication of data costs so

00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,269
Ryan why don't you talk about the drupal

00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,639
advantage in why Drupal is kind of

00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:46,949
uniquely sheriff I'd to deliver on this

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,379
yeah whenever we're pitching Drupal then

00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:51,600
as the e-commerce platform that someone

00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:53,669
should consider over Magento or Hybris

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,339
or whatever other solution that we're

00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:57,989
competing against the time you know we

00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:01,019
acknowledge that they need this sort of

00:15:57,989 --> 00:16:03,449
seamless customer experience where the

00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:05,749
customer can hop from sort of section to

00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:07,949
section of the website without losing

00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:11,129
you know where they were on the site

00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:13,019
what were they doing at the time what

00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:14,309
have they how have they interacted with

00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:16,410
you in the past so they're not going

00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:18,720
from the store to a blogging platform

00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:20,399
where the user accounts aren't connected

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,109
at all we're saying that we want them to

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,480
have a seamless customer experience so

00:16:22,109 --> 00:16:26,819
we start with this seamless data where

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,799
all of the all of the e-commerce and

00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:31,049
user interaction data and any other data

00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,269
that we need the content there

00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:35,009
friendless their status updates their

00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:38,309
email notifications whatever is all sort

00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:40,470
of there in one pool for us to pull from

00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:42,839
so whenever we're trying to develop a

00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:45,629
robust customer experience we have we

00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:47,249
have sort of one API and one data set

00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:49,199
where everything is sort of all managed

00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:51,629
through one user account and we sort of

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,220
decrease the the development time the

00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:56,399
effort required so the projects can be

00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:59,039
delivered cheaper and quicker and still

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,350
integrate their purchase history with

00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,359
their commenting and posting history

00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,889
with their their browsing history and

00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:07,649
whatever else it is that that you were

00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:10,319
tracking on the side in the database so

00:17:07,649 --> 00:17:12,360
that's that's really the the Drupal

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,610
advantage here is just the the seamless

00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,949
data and in the sort of single origin

00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:20,059
API and skill set that your developers

00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:22,260
are having to to bring to the table to

00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:23,970
implement whatever it is that you know

00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:27,000
you're doing whether it's a kiosk like

00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:29,220
functionality or even just a buy it now'

00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,169
button beside a blog widget or something

00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,260
you know that we've sort of done the

00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:38,429
full the full spectrum of solutions

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,750
within commerce guys so thank reaching

00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:41,660
to the choir I think

00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,220
sort of stating the obvious but

00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:49,320
sometimes that's that's necessary we've

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:51,060
actually seen some good wins here one in

00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,420
particular I won't name customer name

00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:56,700
Kazan gone live yet but it was in the US

00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:58,760
large customer we were actually working

00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,660
with a Magento partner and the customer

00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,450
because they didn't know anything else

00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,760
they were a Drupal customer but they

00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:10,320
thought Jesus to do my commerce I guess

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:12,570
I need magento right and we along with a

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,220
partner really looked at their needs and

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,740
we saw that their needs were heavily

00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,420
content oriented and they were going to

00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:22,710
really it was important for them to

00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:27,540
really build an engaging experience and

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:29,370
really bring users together and you know

00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:33,990
talking with them and talking through

00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:36,090
that they were convinced or they believe

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:38,730
themselves that having a single solution

00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:41,250
on Drupal to do all of that to handle

00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:44,100
content community Commerce was the best

00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:46,740
solution and we snatch that away from

00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,590
from our competitors and we're in the

00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,780
midst of building that now so good

00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,850
example and and from a development

00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,110
standpoint as Drupal developers or if

00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,260
you have Drupal developers in your

00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:00,930
business it's not a guy it's just not

00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,820
that difficult and I mean i sat in a a

00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:05,670
sales meeting that went on for too long

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,740
a couple of weeks ago it was most of my

00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:09,810
morning a little bit of my afternoon but

00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,000
the customer was basically trying to get

00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:14,880
for me what what is special about Drupal

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,650
commerce that's that's basically going

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,390
to help them provide a better

00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:21,180
integration with the third party

00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,590
services they were using for I don't

00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,660
know accounting and account management

00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:27,270
and campaign monitoring all that kind of

00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,370
stuff I said well there's nothing really

00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,720
special here we don't like all the

00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,370
pieces are there you just need to tell

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,560
me what you want it to do and I can plug

00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,300
them together in a matter of hours it

00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:39,240
was almost like it was it was too simple

00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:41,310
for them they they were almost wanting

00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,950
to lock themselves into a more solid

00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:45,150
platform that had a definite offer than

00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,100
one that you said well no really like i

00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,480
can just translate any data you need to

00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,350
wherever it needs to go just tell me

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,049
what you want

00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:53,330
you to embed so it's it's actually a bit

00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:55,620
of a bit of a customer education

00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:58,260
challenge to really communicate what

00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,880
that like this level of freedom that you

00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,700
get from the seamless data and single

00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,990
API offers you and then another example

00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,990
that just came to mind is if you go to

00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:08,460
the Louisville web group blog they

00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,890
actually I think we recently posted a

00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,870
tutorial on how to actually use Drupal

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,610
to build a newsletter that actually

00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:17,190
makes product recommendations based on

00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,539
your customers purchase history and so

00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,910
again yeah you're sort of you know

00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:22,169
sourcing content from the site matching

00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,280
it up with what the users purchased

00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:25,380
before and then probably running it

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,940
through rules and the message module to

00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,710
send out these really targeted email

00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,990
campaigns and again it's you know it's

00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:33,750
all because we have that single data

00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:36,179
source and single API that sort of ties

00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:38,159
everything together so that's on the

00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:39,510
Louisville web group I I think they

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,340
spelled the name out it might just be L

00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:44,220
web gee I don't know but it was on

00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:46,919
planet really recommend the read great

00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,840
thanks so let's get to a trend number

00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,700
two which is merchandising which is just

00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,690
all about targeting and personalizing

00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:57,780
and offer a message or content whatever

00:20:53,690 --> 00:21:00,210
and the key here is that as commerce is

00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:03,750
becoming more of a utility and just just

00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:06,059
just there people expect it it's it's

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,770
easy for anyone to sell online which

00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:10,140
makes it harder to differentiate

00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:12,450
merchants today are going to depend more

00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:15,570
and more on being able to merchandise

00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:17,909
and merchandising is simply targeting

00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:19,799
you know the right content to the right

00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:23,429
user at the right time that's what it is

00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:25,590
it sounds so simple but merchants today

00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:28,260
struggle with being able to do that well

00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:30,299
and technology and Drupal in particular

00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:32,429
has got many of the foundational

00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:40,620
elements that that will make that very

00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:44,010
very easy so you know knowing starting

00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:46,470
with a single seamless system to do

00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:49,500
content community Commerce means that

00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:51,179
you know more about that user you know

00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,760
how they interact with content you know

00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:55,559
how they interact with other people you

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,270
know how they're interacting on the

00:21:55,559 --> 00:22:00,059
store you know a lot of information you

00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:03,530
can use that information to tailor the

00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:08,310
experience to that user

00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:11,100
and you know increasingly merchandising

00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:12,570
or tailoring and targeting and

00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:16,140
personalizing the message is going to be

00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:17,880
much more important for success again

00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,150
the right content the right user at the

00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:23,610
right time you're driving connections

00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:25,920
between users and around their network

00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:31,230
and and you know you're just making the

00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:34,440
experience much much better long as talk

00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:36,150
topic many of you may have been hearing

00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,800
this term omni-channel a lot of people

00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:40,230
hate this term because they don't know

00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,460
what it means including myself and so

00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:47,520
they really started to dig the

00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:49,800
television they're not exactly and

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,690
really what omni-channel is and I'll

00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,710
just go through a quick kind of history

00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:58,040
of Commerce and and why this makes sense

00:22:54,710 --> 00:23:01,470
is really about providing a single view

00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:03,990
of your customer and to your customer so

00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:06,180
back in the day and even today with many

00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:08,580
commerce platforms you know it's a

00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:10,740
single view of a product a customer

00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:14,400
comes on and they either engage with

00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:17,070
that merchant through a store or local

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,560
store or their online store or on the

00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:23,490
phone but they have really a single view

00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:26,040
of the product and it's not integrated

00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:27,720
at all a couple years ago the big term

00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,550
within commerce was multi-channel

00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,440
everyone was talking about multi-channel

00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:34,440
most didn't know what it really meant

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,420
but all I meant is that there was really

00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,920
a single view of the stocks so

00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:41,820
regardless of whether it came into a

00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:44,910
store a physical store or a online store

00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:47,910
digital store or a mobile store you know

00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:50,310
I was still seeing a single view of the

00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:52,950
inventory and and and the stock

00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:55,700
regardless where it existed great

00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:59,190
improvement but where we are today is

00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:01,410
what's called omni-channel which is a

00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:04,620
single view of the customer and this is

00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:06,830
all about what I was talking about my

00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:09,270
previous slide which is really knowing

00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,540
everything about that customer and their

00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:13,120
behavior and how their inner

00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:16,540
acting and using that to target them and

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:21,430
really creating a very special and

00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:23,800
interesting experience for them and I do

00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:26,800
have to give credit to Paul Shang from

00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:30,370
flux I don't think he's here but he's in

00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:31,900
the UK fluxes in the UK and he was kind

00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:36,010
enough to kind of share his thinking

00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:37,810
along this and so Drupal when you look

00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:41,110
at it this way and having that single

00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:45,070
view of the customer and in the context

00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:46,660
of what Ryan was talking about there are

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,840
very few commerce platforms that can

00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:55,150
tell a story as strongly as what we have

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:58,120
a Drupal it the risk is getting

00:24:55,150 --> 00:25:00,340
swallowed up in complexity and and and

00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:03,160
we suffer from that as well I think the

00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,260
whole Drupal community does simplifying

00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:08,560
the story in the message but I think the

00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:12,400
point is is that the message is there is

00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:14,530
real and customers are looking to

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,560
benefit from that so Ryan let me hand it

00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:19,330
over to you talk about kind of Drupal

00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,250
advantage around merchandising when

00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:22,890
first of all sort of talk about the the

00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:25,240
challenge for us just as e-commerce

00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:26,950
developers and integrators in general is

00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,340
that then we think about merchandising

00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:32,770
from a brick-and-mortar standpoint it's

00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:35,230
it's really pretty simple I think you're

00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:37,510
basically able to toy with you know

00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:39,760
where do I put a product is it on the

00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:41,290
front shelf on the end cap or is it

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,090
tucked away in the back somewhere is it

00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:45,130
is the milk in the very back so people

00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:48,670
have to walk past all the goodies to buy

00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:51,160
their milk and eggs or maybe like what

00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:53,220
time of year is it so I can put the the

00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:56,110
halloween stuff out around now

00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:58,000
thanksgiving stuff out in a month it but

00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:00,330
they really aren't a whole lot of things

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,370
you can change about your grocery store

00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:05,400
to more effectively merchandise your

00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:07,750
product but here we are on the internet

00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,940
where it's it's not just about like

00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,530
what's going to be I don't I don't think

00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,650
people talk about above the fold anymore

00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:16,780
do they but like what's above the fold

00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:18,160
or what's in it people are stopping to

00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:21,100
do this as well what's in this

00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:24,310
page slide show that nobody really cares

00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:26,620
for anymore either but but we sort of

00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:28,150
have this this broader context a few our

00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:30,520
customers and what's in this current

00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:32,650
page request run one tool that I

00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,000
integrated I think last year the year

00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:37,360
before is called back store that

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,980
actually you know let you change the

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,930
appearance in display of your website

00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,690
based on whether or not somebody liked

00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:45,370
you on facebook and was a female

00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:47,560
browsing from an iphone you know over

00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,330
the age of 35 you know like that that

00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,530
level of customization you aren't you

00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:52,420
aren't sending people in your grocery

00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:56,340
store to the 35 in a pile and then the

00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:58,990
20 to 25 I like its you have a lot more

00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,970
to manage and what's what's difficult

00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:04,600
about that then is getting the tooling

00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:06,370
right to make it simple for the merchant

00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,830
to actually manage and target these

00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:09,910
things because if contextual commerce is

00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:12,550
really about how do we as developers

00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:14,140
sort of integrate the different facets

00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:15,970
of the website so that it's a really

00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,200
seamless customer experience with

00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,760
merchandising we're really trying to

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,760
figure out how can we as developers

00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:24,820
create the tools that are merchants then

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,260
use to to deliver the right content at

00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:29,380
the right time to the right customer and

00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,370
to personalize the message and change

00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,050
the phone number because they're

00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:34,960
browsing from the UK instead of France

00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:36,850
and show different graphic because who

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,740
knows maybe your your electrical outlets

00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,540
are different here versus in the US and

00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,850
you want it to be all really cozy and

00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:45,970
welcoming and known and whatever I'm so

00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:47,530
it's a much bigger challenge it's not

00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:50,200
just a matter of educating the merchant

00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:51,970
on how to use an end cap and how to how

00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,160
to place stuff in the store and track

00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:56,950
use you know customer walking through

00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,990
the store it's it's really how do you

00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:01,000
change every facet of the website based

00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:03,340
on the context of any given page request

00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,980
and so the Drupal advantage here is that

00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,990
we have the tooling in place to let you

00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:11,560
as developers and deb shops to create

00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:13,830
the sort of suite of tools and and

00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:16,000
functional that your merchants will use

00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:18,040
i'll come back to that in a second but

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,080
the idea is that like it's easy for us

00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,430
to segment users for example because we

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,110
have user roles and if that's not

00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:25,330
sufficient well we can just add a

00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:27,700
taxonomy term reference field to a user

00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:29,500
profile and start to tag them however we

00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,090
want to to classify users just segment

00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,020
then put them in

00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:35,340
this and then begin to target content to

00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:37,679
in one recent side that I built the

00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,840
business owner versus the employee all

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,760
right so that's that's really simple but

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,620
then you can go from there to build an

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,419
actual page request context that

00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,000
collates like their user information

00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:51,330
with data on the content they're viewing

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,520
and maybe the HTTP referer and maybe the

00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:55,529
other other pages on your site that

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,330
they've liked using the flag module or

00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:59,360
whatever it is that you're using i'm so

00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:03,840
then you have modules like context or

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:06,330
maybe sub domain or panels that are able

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,130
to take some sort of part of this

00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,649
context and actually create an entirely

00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:12,690
different layout of the page so whether

00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:14,580
you're doing landing pages so in this in

00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:16,409
this pitch that we were part of a couple

00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:19,230
weeks ago yeah a couple weeks ago now

00:29:16,409 --> 00:29:21,570
the idea was they actually wanted unique

00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:24,929
landing pages for what were essentially

00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:26,760
sub stores of the main store and we

00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,860
could do that just using the subdomain

00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:32,070
model based on what URL someone came in

00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,390
from and then we could see like what sub

00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,409
store they apart of and then what

00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:37,740
products are the purchased in the past

00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:39,179
to fill the front page using views with

00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,549
the products from that sub store that

00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:43,169
are most relevant to them I mean so so

00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:45,270
we could do this we actually did this in

00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:47,520
a demo for this client we had one guy

00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:48,870
work on it for about two weeks he didn't

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,200
sleep a whole lot but it's still like

00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:53,520
not a lot of effort and and he actually

00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,809
delivered a demo that really knocked

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,620
their socks off because it was almost

00:29:54,809 --> 00:30:00,659
like a proof of K a proof of concept for

00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:03,419
that for their entire store like their

00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:05,820
entire needs know granted it wasn't yet

00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:07,799
integrated into sa p and it didn't yet

00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:10,620
have the theme and all that stuff polish

00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:12,539
but in a very short amount of time we

00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,490
able to rapidly prototype exactly what

00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:16,110
they needed to be able to merchandise

00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:17,520
their products to their customers and

00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:20,429
another recent example that I've

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,429
discovered is the power of the message

00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:24,870
module when combined with rules because

00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:26,880
message makes it really easy for you to

00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:29,700
create basically email templates that

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,320
have tokens and that you define however

00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,649
you want to define and then you use

00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,450
rules to pull data from the the user

00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:38,159
account the order they just you know

00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:40,409
completed the product they're viewing or

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,320
whatever and and then sort of don't you

00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:43,570
sort of Matt

00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,330
data properties from these different

00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:48,039
entities to the tokens in the message

00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:50,649
and send out a very personalized email

00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:52,720
so this was a nonprofit side that I was

00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:55,750
just doing you know at home for a

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,250
friends and we had I think three or four

00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,809
different email templates by the time it

00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,789
was done that call people of other first

00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:02,200
name and but their address in it and how

00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:04,330
much they donated and what company they

00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,399
were part of and invited them to do more

00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:08,529
on the website without me having to

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:11,200
really write any code to facilitate any

00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:14,169
of that so the tooling that Drupal

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,990
offers to help you help your merchants

00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:18,490
merchandise is great but what's what's

00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,840
not there yet and I mean this kind of

00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:22,419
goes back to what I said earlier is that

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,340
the Drupal sort of developers are our

00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:26,289
community of contributors has not yet

00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:28,450
sort of package some of these solutions

00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:30,759
into more like concrete things so you

00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:32,889
can't just you can't install a commerce

00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:34,450
merchandising module one because

00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:36,129
merchandising is so different in so many

00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:37,779
different use cases but but also because

00:31:36,129 --> 00:31:39,820
nobody's really taking the time to

00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:41,289
really decide okay what what bits of

00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,730
functionality be most useful as a

00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:45,309
merchant to be able to market my

00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:47,470
products so there's actually some room

00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:50,080
there for four interested developers or

00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:51,940
integrators or partners to to really

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,059
take the lead on some of that I'm in the

00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:57,100
meantime and what we can do is easily

00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:59,320
integrate with additional third party

00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,929
service providers to either bring more

00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:04,090
data to the table such as with villacis

00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:05,649
Automator which actually uses white

00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:08,559
labels a robust marketing automation

00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:10,149
tool and then brings campaigns and lists

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,639
and segments and all that stuff into

00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:13,929
Drupal for use by rules so we have with

00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,070
those kinds of tools that are bringing

00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:16,539
more information in the table but then

00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,860
we also have tools like noster which

00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:20,679
we've recently integrated with commerce

00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:22,000
in partnership with nosto to actually

00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:24,370
make better sense of the data you

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,049
already have in a way that doesn't

00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,610
necessarily require the you know the

00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:29,769
configuration of five different Drupal

00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:31,299
modules to figure out but it actually

00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:32,889
can make those recommendations and

00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:35,370
cross-selling and things like that on

00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:37,480
your behalf and then integrate it into

00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:39,789
you know that this standard you know

00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,769
Drupal components where there's blocks

00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:44,710
or views results or whatever email

00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:46,450
templates so that so that we're sort of

00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:48,070
beginning to sort of explore these

00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,679
opportunities for merchandising but I'd

00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:52,769
love to see their you know be a lot more

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,770
going on in the the commerce community

00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:56,510
absolutely and you know Ryan

00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:58,910
make it sound so simple when you explain

00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:02,210
it this is a really tough problem I

00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:05,240
think the point is is that you know

00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:08,720
within the Drupal world there are so

00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,370
many kind of fundamental tools in just

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,850
the way it's designed and architected

00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:17,510
that make this much much simpler Ryan

00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:19,240
said you know we've partnered with nosto

00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:23,150
which is a personalization

00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:25,490
recommendation engine that's a common

00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:27,440
way and one in which will you know

00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:29,810
continue to work because they can do

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,990
that better than us but I think we're

00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:36,140
also going to try to focus more on a

00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:37,400
merchandising module it really takes all

00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:39,650
these elements and pulls them together

00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,600
into something that you could show a

00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:43,520
customer and the customer would go yeah

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,830
that's that's what I'm looking for

00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:48,170
that's what I need and so that's a lot

00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:50,740
of what we're trying to do is is make

00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:53,030
kind of recognize trends in the market

00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:56,300
we obviously want to input from everyone

00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:58,870
here but really focusing on providing a

00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:00,890
better user experience and

00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:04,730
out-of-the-box experience so that

00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:07,370
customers can visualize the story we

00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:09,200
also have run a chorus we talked about

00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:11,300
there yeah an example here this is sort

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,140
of a high-level on merchandising example

00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:17,149
was that commerce guys partnered with

00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:18,260
publicist modem I believe sure hope I

00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:20,690
got that right they're going to let me

00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:23,450
know if I didn't to deliver the Cartier

00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:25,429
Cartier relaunch basically and Cartier

00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:28,250
has 22 different subsides for different

00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:30,320
countries and then they target content

00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:33,350
on a regional basis obviously with

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,970
regional pricing regional language and

00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:36,260
then additional sorts you know bits of

00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:38,360
what we call you know product catalog

00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:42,409
enrichment so we're we're adding did I

00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:44,540
get that right thank you you know then

00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:46,880
ritching the product catalog with with

00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:50,240
videos and imagery and text that really

00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:52,820
are tailored to specific markets and we

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,010
were able to help them build their full

00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:57,530
back in catalog enrichment sort of

00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:59,510
interface using existing modules like

00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:01,790
views and inline in to deform and flags

00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:03,590
and translation interfaces and things

00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:05,360
like that so they actually have this

00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:08,570
really robust you know

00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,040
merchandising platform that drives all

00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,910
of the content pages on their sites but

00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,600
it's going to be different between

00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:16,790
Cartier us and Cartier JP and that coat

00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,380
UK and all the different sub sites we

00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:20,270
very tailored to their markets now

00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,620
that's that's pretty high level this is

00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:23,930
something that has multiple sites and

00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:26,450
just wants each site to be tailored to

00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:28,280
that market it could obviously go even

00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:30,800
deeper to be personalized based on what

00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,360
somebody put in their wish list which is

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,360
about all I can afford to do on their

00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:36,860
website or you know put in their

00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,440
shopping bag and say for later and all

00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,930
that kind of stuff but that that kind of

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,790
example I brought a lot of value to the

00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:49,520
table for them and convince them a large

00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:52,160
company and other you know French cheese

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:55,190
luxury retailers based in pairs to begin

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,590
to choose Drupal commerce as their

00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:59,540
platform of choice I'm including kenzo

00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:04,640
and your lane mother's from the city and

00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:07,460
elsewhere in Europe thanks so getting on

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:12,110
to the the last trend which is commerce

00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:14,600
anywhere and everywhere we believe it

00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:16,610
shouldn't just ended the shopping cart

00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:22,280
but should exist anywhere where it makes

00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:24,920
sense and the the key trend and Ryan has

00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,680
been talking about this for quite a

00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:33,200
while as it relates to Drupal commerce

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:35,570
to and Andrew blade is that Drupal

00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,330
commerce is really going to be a

00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:41,450
platform that tries to fit in rather

00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:43,190
than take over an environment and that's

00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:45,800
going to be increasingly important as a

00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:47,390
complexity the the technical or

00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,660
infrastructure complexity within

00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:52,940
companies increases the last thing they

00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:55,040
want is a big system that plopped down

00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,900
and kind of takes over and requires

00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,870
everything then integrate into it and

00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:02,030
requires lots of support what they would

00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:05,090
like is particularly if they're using

00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:08,630
Drupal already for content is to enable

00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:12,530
commerce to exist very lightweight in

00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:14,420
many places and take advantage of data

00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:16,430
and information so that that data

00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,730
information only exist once it doesn't

00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:19,880
have to

00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:21,230
replicate it and so the notion of of

00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:25,460
kind of fitting in is going to be

00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:27,290
increasingly important and also being

00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,670
able to handle all types of transactions

00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:31,610
I was talking to somebody yesterday a

00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:35,060
partner from the UK who knows both

00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:37,310
magento and drupal commerce they say you

00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:39,110
know magento is great but only if i want

00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:42,650
to sell a thing you know widget

00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:45,320
something if it's anything non-standard

00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:47,780
like that it's it's really hard you have

00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:52,790
to kind of take it apart and put it

00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:55,030
together yourself but really leveraging

00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:58,630
integrating all the data that's in there

00:37:55,030 --> 00:38:02,540
you know just reduces complexity and

00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:04,340
duplication of data and as of stolen

00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:06,440
your thing becoming a conduit of

00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:11,420
information rather than just another

00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:15,020
separate container that exists and the

00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:17,360
thing is is that being everywhere is not

00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:22,040
easy for most ecommerce platforms it's

00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:25,730
really hard they drive the store model

00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:27,320
because that's what they do for us it's

00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:30,200
much easier for Drupal it's much easier

00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:33,170
and for your customers they're going to

00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:35,420
be thinking about this more and more

00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:38,060
about how they can want to engage your

00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:41,350
customers and drive transactions not at

00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:45,470
the end but throughout the whole process

00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:47,270
right sure and that like that this idea

00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,530
is kind of hard to communicate and this

00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:50,750
goes back to what I said earlier about

00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:52,580
the M the sales pitch Rogers County you

00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:54,260
know we can do whatever you want just

00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:57,350
define for us what you want done and

00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:59,210
will do it is this idea that like drupal

00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:01,490
commerce is this this conduit it's not a

00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:03,200
container we want data to move freely

00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:05,420
between the back-end systems that are

00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,220
actually driving the business and then

00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,950
the point of sale system which is just

00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:12,640
the website and then maybe I'm into the

00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:15,680
mobile you know the mobile interface or

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,030
the the store kiosk or the point of sale

00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,740
system in the brick and mortar whatever

00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:20,330
it is and we want it we want this

00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:22,670
information to be free-flowing up and

00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:26,000
down the chain and this is easy for us

00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:27,410
because all of Drupal commerce is data

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
is you know modeled around the feel

00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,200
double entity system and therefore it's

00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,720
the same as any other a bit of data

00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,640
inside of drupal which means we already

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,870
have the tools in place to facilitate

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,940
the transfer of information back and

00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:40,610
forth whether it's using the migrated

00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:42,200
module to bring that in from an external

00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:46,400
data source and put it into your drupal

00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:48,860
site or feeds or using the the json

00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,560
encoding api zhesan stuff out defining

00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:53,210
REST API resources through the services

00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,820
module or in Drupal 8 through the rest

00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:57,290
module itself that's in core all all of

00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:59,780
this stuff is just sort of stand or

00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:00,800
Drupal and even more so in Drupal 8 so

00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,880
we're trying to begin to just

00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,090
communicate what does it mean that

00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,560
Drupal commerce really can be a sort of

00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:08,390
free-flowing conduit of information that

00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,800
that doesn't just need to have all your

00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:11,990
data and in fact like it it really

00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,790
shouldn't have all of your data when it

00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:15,770
comes to say analytics for example with

00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:17,750
commerce 1 dot x we thought well let's

00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:19,730
retain as much information about every

00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:23,180
order as possible and so we made the

00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:24,920
default default revision setting for

00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,660
orders to sort of create a new revision

00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,820
every time something changed in the in

00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:30,470
the shopping cart so you end up with

00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,330
this this order that maybe has like an

00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,280
order ID of three and it's checked out

00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:36,950
maybe ten years later that's a bit

00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:39,140
extreme 10 weeks later because that

00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:41,150
order never died and the customer came

00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,620
back and left and came back and left and

00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:44,420
added stuff remove Stephenie end up with

00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:46,520
this huge mess of data that no one's

00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:48,140
actually able to use because it's it's

00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,850
still tucked away in revision tables and

00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:51,260
it's really not the place for that if

00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:53,660
you really want to track the customer

00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:55,370
touchpoints and and the effectiveness of

00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,660
email campaigns and when did they click

00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,220
and how long did it take them to check

00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:00,010
out and convert you're really

00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:02,990
integrating with some sort of external

00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:04,850
analytics um you know engine that says

00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:06,410
doing all of that for you and we just

00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:08,210
need to make sure that it's easy to send

00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:10,070
data from the drupal commerce site to

00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:12,140
the analytic system because you already

00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:13,960
have you know a best to breed you know

00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:16,400
solution that does that for you so

00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:19,220
really trying to mature in that regard

00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,750
and again with with Drupal Drupal 8 and

00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:23,270
commerce to that X will see this sort of

00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:25,490
develop even further because we have a

00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:27,920
rest module in core and a better API for

00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:30,740
consuming remote web services it's

00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,050
called guzzle I think that's right it's

00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:34,820
just a just a library that we've added

00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,410
in Drupal 8 to actually make HTTP

00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:39,170
requests and interact with

00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:43,120
I'm so so Drupal is maturing and

00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:43,120
commerce has sort of benefit by default

00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:48,320
yeah yeah but it's it's still like

00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,210
there's still that customer education

00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,980
challenge because they asked me on it

00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:53,330
all I can imagine is that magento

00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,280
whenever they came in to make the pitch

00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:56,810
sort of had a spreadsheet it said here

00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,130
are the different API endpoints at your

00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:00,200
disposal if you need to do an API

00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:01,550
integration and they asked me for this

00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:05,000
chart i said well there isn't a chart

00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:06,920
every entity type has a resource there

00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,590
is no there's no charge just like

00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,820
everything is available to you what more

00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:12,650
do you need to know do you understand

00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,240
how rest works and I they didn't

00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:16,160
understand how rest worked or they were

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,930
bedazzled by a pretty chart that sort of

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,620
laid it out that maybe I need to go get

00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:23,840
on creating but it was it was just sort

00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:25,930
of like this this level of flexibility i

00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:29,180
think was just kind of unexpected and so

00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:31,790
as a community and maybe as a maintainer

00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:33,050
in a company we ought to be really

00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,730
really communicating this more

00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,650
effectively maybe that means sort of

00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:38,330
dumbing down the content a little bit to

00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:40,010
sort of speak at our competitors level

00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:42,320
that sounds really ivory tower doesn't

00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:43,850
it but maybe that's what actually needs

00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,310
to happen so that people really grasped

00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:47,990
the idea that that drupal commerce isn't

00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:49,370
trying to be opinionated it's not trying

00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:51,710
to get into your way it really wants to

00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:53,240
to fit in to where you need it to be and

00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:55,310
not try to piss tickets hands where it

00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:59,470
doesn't belong even to the extent that

00:42:55,310 --> 00:43:02,360
we have projects that that that use

00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:03,650
maybe this maybe over some heads but use

00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,270
an entity controller that can load

00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:07,100
product data from a remote website

00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:08,690
entirely so like their drupal site

00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,670
doesn't even store their product

00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:12,140
information whenever a product is loaded

00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:14,480
it actually is making a remote you know

00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,740
web service request to load the product

00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,570
and then you know use it throughout the

00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,160
rest of the page request like there's

00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,390
there's a really high level of

00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,250
flexibility here that no other

00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:26,000
e-commerce system is affording anybody

00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:27,470
today and you know more examples but

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,540
blob were kind of at a time and I'd love

00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:32,150
to hear from the audience well you know

00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:34,310
and a couple of examples where this is

00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:37,670
important we won drupal commerce

00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:41,270
customers here in Europe and UK so royal

00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:43,610
mail in the UK and Eurostar I think are

00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:47,090
two great examples the reason we won is

00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:48,829
our ability to fit in they had they all

00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:51,349
have big big environments

00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:52,640
big infrastructure's lots of systems and

00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:55,839
they didn't need another one they just

00:43:52,640 --> 00:44:00,019
needed drupal commerce to come in and

00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:01,609
handle transactions and and do that as

00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:03,349
seamlessly as possible and we were able

00:44:01,609 --> 00:44:06,829
to show them that and and they're

00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:09,739
driving huge numbers of transactions and

00:44:06,829 --> 00:44:13,579
volume really is a proprietary numbers

00:44:09,739 --> 00:44:15,579
that yeah yeah i mean the the numbers

00:44:13,579 --> 00:44:18,229
that the the you know the biggest most

00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:20,660
commercial proprietary e-commerce

00:44:18,229 --> 00:44:27,200
platforms are talking about we're doing

00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:29,569
that with drupal commerce so coming to

00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,009
our last slide here really key takeaway

00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:34,249
is just trying to sum it all up for

00:44:31,009 --> 00:44:37,130
everybody here again starting with how

00:44:34,249 --> 00:44:39,319
people are buying I always just look at

00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:45,529
how I buy you know and this pretty much

00:44:39,319 --> 00:44:50,299
represents how i buy things and you know

00:44:45,529 --> 00:44:52,609
having a content driven commerce system

00:44:50,299 --> 00:44:54,799
at the center makes a lot of sense when

00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:59,119
you think how important it is for

00:44:54,799 --> 00:45:02,479
content in in making a decision really

00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:06,440
influencing what you buy that digital

00:45:02,479 --> 00:45:08,359
journey around the experience and the

00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,819
connections the social connections are

00:45:08,359 --> 00:45:15,469
really strong influencers and something

00:45:10,819 --> 00:45:20,440
that Drupal is uniquely qualified to do

00:45:15,469 --> 00:45:26,029
better than anyone else knowing because

00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:28,430
Drupal is providing all of the content

00:45:26,029 --> 00:45:30,469
community Commerce functionality in a

00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:32,449
single seamless system that means we

00:45:30,469 --> 00:45:34,309
know everything about the user we know

00:45:32,449 --> 00:45:36,170
how they're interacting with content and

00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:38,299
people and what they're buying and we

00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:41,150
can use that to target and personalized

00:45:38,299 --> 00:45:45,199
I have the NSA back door module right

00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:48,140
what you had to bring the NSA in this

00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:52,400
presentation they should really get on

00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:57,440
like a marketing solution I think yeah

00:45:52,400 --> 00:46:00,440
and finally commerce should exist

00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,510
everywhere not just at the end should

00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:05,569
exist anywhere where it makes sense and

00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:08,420
where the customer is ready to buy so

00:46:05,569 --> 00:46:11,029
with that thank you for your attention

00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:13,190
hopefully it was informative and we have

00:46:11,029 --> 00:46:15,140
some time I think we have 15 minutes for

00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:18,349
questions if anyone wants to ask a

00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:19,549
question or even not questions if you'd

00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:21,339
like to come to the microphone and brag

00:46:19,549 --> 00:46:24,799
I actually love to hear from people that

00:46:21,339 --> 00:46:29,779
you know are pitching drupal commerce

00:46:24,799 --> 00:46:31,279
either as an invisible back-end such as

00:46:29,779 --> 00:46:32,690
maybe a native mobile app that's driven

00:46:31,279 --> 00:46:34,369
by a commerce site that nobody ever

00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:35,599
actually uses or is there anybody that

00:46:34,369 --> 00:46:37,760
actually is developing or has

00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,890
implemented merchandising solutions and

00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,500
how did you strategize that how did you

00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:44,720
sell that it has any any inside and

00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:52,880
that'll be great examples ideas things

00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:55,460
you love us to focus on more takes one

00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,950
all right hey we got to all right first

00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:59,690
one in the way back there yeah there's a

00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:04,039
mic here in the middle if you're not

00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:05,599
bashful yeah thanks for that I mean it's

00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:07,160
goodly talking about nobody can do

00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,920
everything and you go to a client so you

00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:12,770
tell me what needs to do but i'm working

00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,359
for quite a large law firm and they've

00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:16,250
been out of inroads into them from

00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:17,210
people like squares etc cuz they've kind

00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,730
of told them what they should be doing

00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:22,339
so in terms of commerce guys if we got

00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:23,900
any documentation or use cases where

00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,700
you've actually you can go to them and

00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,750
say you know we can do anything but a

00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:30,589
lot of people actually want to be told

00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:32,960
very specific stuff they only see your

00:47:30,589 --> 00:47:35,930
it's more about focusing on a particular

00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,760
vertical or industry yes it's more you

00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:38,839
know it's great he can go and say you

00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,400
know we can know anything you want but

00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:42,109
sometimes people want to be told the

00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,789
solution no that's exactly right like

00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:45,740
product izing drupal commerce your

00:47:43,789 --> 00:47:46,880
product izing a consulting our base case

00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:48,500
that is why you can say you know this

00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:52,069
this isn't this worked yeah this

00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:55,309
industry yeah you're actually right i

00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:57,079
think that's one of the challenges in

00:47:55,309 --> 00:47:58,700
the Drupal world at you know ah quee has

00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:01,039
been spending a lot of times trying to

00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:04,690
put together demos really engaging demos

00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:06,910
so that people can see how drew

00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:10,000
solves their problem not can do

00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:11,500
everything and that and that's a risk

00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,839
for us you know the infinite and

00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,550
flexibility creates complexity that

00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:17,109
scares customers it's the bottom line I

00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:18,730
think you know the best way that we're

00:48:17,109 --> 00:48:21,520
trying to deal with it is is true

00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:23,470
customer examples and case studies I

00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,880
don't know I mean that's what that's

00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:27,010
what customers want to see they want to

00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,140
see like customers and what they've done

00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:30,700
but I may actually interject they're

00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,319
probably an even better way that we're

00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:35,380
sort of product tising comments as

00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:36,880
through commerce kickstart so so the

00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,170
idea that we have this distribution of

00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,849
drupal commerce called commerce

00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:41,349
kickstart and their two versions I'm

00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:43,660
talking specifically about version 2

00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:47,020
that basically implements a reference

00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:49,750
store that has very simple merchandising

00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:52,569
faceted search shipping a few payment

00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:54,160
options and done and so that really kind

00:48:52,569 --> 00:48:58,510
of caters to that sort of lower in

00:48:54,160 --> 00:49:00,730
physical product sales merchant and and

00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:03,339
really does give a very concrete set of

00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:05,710
functionality to them and so like we

00:49:03,339 --> 00:49:07,390
sort of floated the idea of additional

00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:10,180
distributions that could be developed to

00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:12,310
sort of be that proof proof of concept

00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:15,790
but but they do take a lot of work to

00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:17,710
maintain so it's like some maybe maybe

00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:20,589
something even lower Phi than that maybe

00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:21,970
it's just a fact sheet or something of

00:49:20,589 --> 00:49:26,859
what a distribution would look like

00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:28,359
could be really interesting but like in

00:49:26,859 --> 00:49:29,980
the case of commerce kickstart there are

00:49:28,359 --> 00:49:31,990
actually sites in our showcase if you go

00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:34,450
to drupal commerce org slash showcase

00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:35,920
that's very obvious that they are just

00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:38,230
commerce kickstart to with a few

00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,940
different colors and then launch they

00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:43,960
even keep our gaudy blue is like the

00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:46,240
highlight color on the front page but

00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:48,190
but it's it's served really well to sort

00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:52,510
of cater to that that lower end mom and

00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:53,950
pop shop family farmer etc to really

00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:55,780
help them wrap their head around what it

00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:59,829
is that commerce can do for them yeah

00:49:55,780 --> 00:50:01,180
that I'm glad you brought that up so you

00:49:59,829 --> 00:50:04,390
know kickstart coupled with case studies

00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:07,420
if you come to our booth at the show

00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:11,020
here or at the conference here you'll

00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:12,550
see a wall of I think 32 sites that are

00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:14,140
all built on Drupal Commerce so we're

00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:14,490
still really trying to showcase customer

00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:17,010
six

00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:19,100
s and and we reach out to a lot of our

00:50:17,010 --> 00:51:17,369
partners a lot of drupal commerce

00:50:19,100 --> 00:51:19,410
partners I mean I would say within

00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:22,109
Commerce guys we don't have and the

00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:24,119
question was just for the recording here

00:51:22,109 --> 00:51:26,040
the question was basically what we're

00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:28,380
talking about content commerce and

00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:30,690
community we can build communities using

00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:34,350
Drupal we can build e-commerce using

00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:37,380
Drupal and we can create also a CMS

00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:39,600
using Drupal but most of the content

00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:42,390
perhaps isn't happening inside of Drupal

00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:45,410
or people don't know how to actually

00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:47,820
structure and organize their content to

00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:49,560
publish it across other platforms and

00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:51,600
elsewhere so i think i think the sort of

00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:53,970
big bucket categories content strategy

00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,650
and in you know how do we actually help

00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:57,619
people do that and I'd say within

00:51:55,650 --> 00:52:01,020
Commerce guys we don't have like a

00:51:57,619 --> 00:52:03,510
content strategy practice i guess like

00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:04,920
the clear leader in the drupal space is

00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:06,450
probably Lola Bob because they're about

00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,330
the only ones that I see talking about

00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:10,920
it yeah yeah I mean and that's not

00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:13,650
really the area of our focus but I think

00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:16,920
it could certainly be the area focus for

00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:19,500
for agencies and partners that's serving

00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,869
the market clearly in the Magento

00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:23,160
community there were a lot of

00:52:20,869 --> 00:52:27,520
integrators magento integrators it

00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:29,380
builds stores not for the make

00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,810
money on the project but making money

00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:33,520
afterwards serving that customer and

00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:36,280
really helping them from a marketing

00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:38,950
standpoint how do you merchandise how do

00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:43,090
you you know create content how do you

00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:45,880
create a rich brand experience which is

00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:49,840
all about content and design and brands

00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:52,030
so it's a really important area it's not

00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:55,000
an area that we focus on as

00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:57,550
technologists but I think at least what

00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,220
I saw in the Magento world it was a huge

00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:03,250
opportunity for partner you know

00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:07,750
agencies integrators who not only wanted

00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:09,340
to help build a site but now maintained

00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:11,230
a long-term relationship with that

00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:13,300
customer from a marketing standpoint

00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:16,600
yeah I think once they are our content

00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:18,040
strategy strategy is to partner with

00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:20,050
people that actually know the field

00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,160
better than we do I'm so that going to

00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:23,740
squeeze and pitch that I've mentioned a

00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:26,740
few times we actually took a partner

00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:29,140
with us to be the drivers of the project

00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:31,450
with Commerce guys supplying me commerce

00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:33,510
functionality but leaning on duo

00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:35,920
consulting out of Chicago to actually

00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:38,140
supply the content strategy expertise

00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,050
and long-term you know nurturing and

00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:43,810
support in that regard so it's kind of a

00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:46,810
non-answer answer but if you are a

00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:47,920
Content strategist yourself we may

00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:50,320
actually be interested in partnering

00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,830
instead there's an opportunity yeah at

00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,830
the motion

00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:07,540
yeah yeah yeah and good product images

00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:14,200
which are really hard to get out of your

00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:17,370
customers question uh yeah actually back

00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:20,830
to more the commerce platform you know I

00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:23,530
think all of us speak to selling points

00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:26,340
of Drupal with our clients but can you

00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:29,320
just comment on some of your experiences

00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:31,270
as far as shortcomings or challenges

00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:34,300
that you experience so that as we're

00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:35,980
helping our clients navigate through the

00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:39,480
process of standing up either a new

00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:43,440
commerce model for them or migrating

00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:46,600
what we can do to to help educate and

00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:49,450
ease those kinds of transitions are you

00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:52,380
saying challenge is in the migration

00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:55,680
process or just any general development

00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:58,480
if you've seen any trends or

00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:02,610
shortcomings with with Drupal

00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:05,800
specifically that we can be aware of to

00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:10,990
to help plan our development process

00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:12,610
around with our clients so not much

00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:15,010
today not everything is great with

00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:17,860
Drupal what are the what are the things

00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:20,320
to watch out for yeah kind of want to

00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:27,340
start with that one or is everything

00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:30,220
great it's really hard to estimate said

00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:32,500
it sort of doubted you for a second yeah

00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:35,920
I think you know I think what we've run

00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:38,440
into more often is is the complexity you

00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:41,230
know the infinite flexibility and

00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:43,240
openness which people want customers

00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:44,740
want they come to you and and they see

00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,360
something out of the box and they say

00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:49,540
well my business doesn't work exactly

00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:52,570
like that can you make it work like this

00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:54,880
and of course we can so they're kind of

00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:56,980
waffling between that flexibility and

00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:00,670
out of the box features and we get hung

00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:04,000
up with that a lot I think you know

00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:06,190
Drupal looks more completa become worse

00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,680
looks more complex than most of our

00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:12,760
competitors out of the box they'd

00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:18,130
probably tell a more connected story

00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:21,220
you know we know that adobe and sitecore

00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:24,520
tell a really great story around CMS and

00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:27,520
and you know it's just a story again

00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:31,120
Drupal we know can can do much better

00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:33,640
but it's telling that story that I think

00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:35,620
trips us up sometimes but maybe I'll

00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:39,210
offer to like really high level things

00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:41,740
11 is the tension between ready and done

00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:44,200
which is how do you actually convince

00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:47,260
your customer to launch with the less

00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:49,900
than ideal you know version of what they

00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:51,430
imagine they might have and I think I

00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:53,200
was talking with Scott this morning

00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:55,570
about a slide that has sort of the

00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,010
traditional idea that the Commerce sort

00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:58,480
of platform is the most important part

00:56:57,010 --> 00:57:00,130
of your business and so we have to have

00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,930
a hundred different ways to create

00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:04,210
coupons in 20 different ways to apply a

00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:05,980
discount and a hundred different facets

00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:08,140
for this that and the other and really

00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:09,700
like they don't they couldn't even tell

00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:11,410
you right off the top of their head if

00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:14,380
any of those types of special offers and

00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:16,060
coupons and configurations are actually

00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:18,190
giving them you know driving any sales

00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:19,750
to their business whatsoever and so I

00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:21,670
mean I've had this challenge personally

00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:23,440
with with a freelance client a few years

00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:25,660
ago she's trying to say like hey let's

00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,250
just launched something but yes we can

00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:28,630
endlessly tool this because hey it's

00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:30,580
Drupal and I can just add another field

00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:32,410
and I can just do this and make a new

00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:34,210
rule in a new view but but really you

00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:36,460
just need to launch because you're ready

00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:40,210
even if it isn't done and we can we can

00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:42,310
add more functionality later but then

00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:43,630
the obviously like it's it's not even an

00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:45,040
elephant in the room right because

00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:48,910
everybody is talking about it it's just

00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:51,220
the idea that the user interface if you

00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:52,960
have a non-technical merchant the user

00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:55,000
interface of bouncing between different

00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,040
entity forms and configuring fields and

00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,870
views and this and all this stuff you

00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:01,450
have to be able to hide that complexity

00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:03,130
from most merchants and that's going to

00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:05,230
that's going to be an additional time

00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:07,330
that you aren't expecting I think

00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:09,730
because as a Drupal shop we know how to

00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:11,290
estimate what it takes to build it but

00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:12,580
are we used to estimating what it takes

00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:14,680
to build it and then what it takes to

00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:16,660
simplify the UI and I don't think that

00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:19,150
we are within commerce kickstart we've

00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:21,010
tried to do this somewhat by sort of

00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:22,870
collapsing the dichotomy between a

00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:25,600
product type versus an o-type into one

00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:27,190
form with the inline

00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:29,620
module and some other views in the

00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:31,120
Commerce back-office module but even

00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:33,640
that's not complete and it won't work

00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:35,710
for every merchant we tried to create a

00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,760
simpler rules user interface so that

00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:39,970
merchants didn't have to learn about

00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:42,280
data selectors and entity has field

00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:44,860
conditions and all this other stuff but

00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:47,920
again it's still not really there so so

00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:49,240
really f'd I'm like to what level is the

00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,850
merchant actually going to be driving

00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:53,560
this website and how much will you have

00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:55,390
to simplify in elements that's going to

00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:57,460
represent added passed on top of a

00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:59,500
drupal site bill that maybe doesn't

00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:01,980
exist in a platform that's really

00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:05,770
tailored specifically to e-commerce

00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:07,330
merchant driven user interfaces there's

00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:09,220
certainly others that that that are

00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:10,510
around mean it from a migration

00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:15,250
standpoint I think the troop allows

00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:16,840
great tools so I like that that

00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:18,940
typically probably a lower-cost part of

00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:20,620
any project that we do but really more

00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:23,170
around really the coupons and

00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:24,790
discounting interface is really probably

00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:28,000
the biggest spin that a lot of our

00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:31,540
larger projects have been been making

00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,520
Ryan we're out of time my my answer on

00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:36,040
that is it we suffer greatest from lack

00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:38,470
of awareness you know you talk to people

00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:40,360
about Drupal you've got existing

00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:41,740
investment in Drupal and want to serve

00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:43,990
their commerce knees with Drupal and

00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:46,450
they look II like what Drupal can do

00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:49,120
that they just don't know and that's why

00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:52,180
we were really glad to see our friends

00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:54,130
at ah quia really come out strong going

00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:56,250
after commerce and we're teamed up with

00:59:54,130 --> 01:00:00,070
them and that's going to help all of us

00:59:56,250 --> 01:00:02,500
we're here to try to help everyone drive

01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:04,360
this message to your customers so don't

01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:07,710
hesitate to reach out to us we're glad

01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:07,710
