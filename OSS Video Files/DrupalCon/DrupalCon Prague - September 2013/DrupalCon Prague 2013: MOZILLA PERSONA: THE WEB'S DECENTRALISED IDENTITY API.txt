Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: MOZILLA PERSONA: THE WEB'S DECENTRALISED IDENTITY API
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	Almost everything we do on the web is governed by open standards. Proving who we are to websites is critically important, but we don't use an open standard for it. The web browser doesn't understand what is going on.

Passwords are unsustainable, but delegating our identity to a handful of for-profit corporations is not the way forward.

Persona connects identity providers (for example, Gmail, or Yahoo! Mail), web browsers, and websites. It is browser mediated, i.e. it will be totally decentralised. Your identity provider will have no knowledge of which sites you are signing into.

Mozilla is bootstrapping the ecosystem. Eventually it will be possible to sign in using Persona without any Mozilla service being involved whatsoever.

One of the senior developers of Persona, Dan Callahan from Mozilla, will start by providing some history of authentication systems, an overview of how Persona works, and a comparison with other technologies.

Jonathan Brown from Bluedroplet will then demonstrate the Drupal module he wrote for signing in with Persona: https://drupal.org/project/persona

okay thank you everybody for for coming

00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:11,730
I don't know how many of you were at

00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:13,740
drupalcon Denver but one of the the

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:17,190
keynotes from rubicon Denver was

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:20,279
Mitchell Baker so she's the chairperson

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,830
of the Mozilla Foundation and one of the

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:26,220
things she spoke about it was a new sign

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:28,320
in technology called persona one of the

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,539
main advantages of this is that when you

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,309
sign in with persona the website you're

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,920
signing into you never gets to see your

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:38,489
password so there's a lot of advantages

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,550
to that so I wanted to use this myself

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:43,800
so I am a drupal developer so I wanted

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:47,280
to see what what Drupal modules there

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,190
were so I find one module first of all

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,730
called browser ID which is the old name

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,430
for persona and it also implemented the

00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:59,100
the older protocol and then I found

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,410
another module called persona that used

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,840
the new name it it used the the new

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,489
protocol so that was great but I had a

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,880
look at the module and I basically

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,909
wanted to rearrange a lot of things so I

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,530
started submitting patches and i think

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,590
that the maintainer got so fed up with

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,470
me submitting so many patches that he he

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,490
gave me commit access to the module and

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:26,820
then I I just ran with that and made a

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:31,799
huge number of changes and it's I think

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:35,009
the module is now very very stable so I

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:38,189
joined the mailing list for Mozilla

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:42,630
identity and told him about the module

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:45,630
got talking to them and Dan he is the

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:49,950
the project lead for the persona project

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:53,189
he he he sent me the the t-shirt for for

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:57,030
persona um and then I I suggested that

00:01:53,189 --> 00:02:00,719
he should come too drupalcon and an tell

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:03,540
us all about Mozilla persona so if we

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,829
can all give a very warm drupal welcome

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,829
to dan callahan

00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,740
thank you it was great I get this email

00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,360
from from Johnny saying oh I've got this

00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,670
talk submission for drupalcon should

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,080
totally come by sure he's like well

00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:32,260
you'll give the first half of the talk

00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,580
and oh so here I am it's that's clearly

00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,820
the way to do it get a talk accepted

00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:40,810
then get somebody else to uh to do it

00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:42,910
pro tip right there so I'm here to talk

00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,340
about how we as a community we the

00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,470
Drupal community are going to kill the

00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,560
password on the internet and the way

00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:53,530
we're going to do that I hope is with

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,840
Mozilla persona persona is a login

00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,640
system it replaces emails and password

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,310
forms it replaces social off on your own

00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:04,150
website and it works on the basis of

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:10,870
verifying email addresses let me show

00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:12,610
you what it looks like so I've recorded

00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,770
a screencast of me logging into a few

00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,170
websites using persona I'm going to

00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,970
start with ray gun I 0 which is an error

00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:22,420
production application error tracking

00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:24,550
app I'm given an option of logging in

00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,890
with an email and password or a number

00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:29,440
of different protocols or other methods

00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,760
I'm going to click on persona and when I

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,130
click there by browser prompts me to

00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,660
enter an email address i can enter any

00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,040
email address i want and in this case

00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,130
I'm going to use my work address d

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:42,280
callahan at mozilla com and when I click

00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,460
Next you'll see very briefly the dialog

00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,960
says checking with your email provider

00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,790
so it's going looking at mozilla com and

00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,400
it finds that mozilla com understands

00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,800
the persona protocol because we eat our

00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,070
own dog food and I get forwarded on to a

00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,560
login page specifically for me to login

00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:02,020
to my my corporate account it's hosted

00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,400
by Mozilla I type in my normal ldap

00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,790
password just as if i was logging into

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:10,720
webmail at work i hit sign in my email

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:13,720
address has been verified and i'm logged

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,459
into ray gun now that i've logged into

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,049
the site once now that I browser knows

00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:20,770
who I am when I go to other websites and

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:21,970
click Sign In if they use persona notice

00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,680
that my email address is already

00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,020
prefilled my browser now knows who I am

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,300
so it only takes me two clicks to log

00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:32,500
into additional websites one to open the

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:34,740
email picker and two to confirm that I

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:38,440
we want to sign into that website after

00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,180
I've used persona once I'm never more

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,650
than two clicks away from logging into

00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,740
another website even if I've never

00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:46,900
visited that site before of course we

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,970
understand that people have different

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,250
identities online me at work is not the

00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,440
same as me at home and so if I want to

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,570
use my gmail address to log into my open

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,570
badges backpack I can simply click the

00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:03,430
add another address button type in dan

00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:06,370
callahan at gmail com and when I click

00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,930
Add just like by Mozilla dress sent me

00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,010
to Mozilla to authenticate a gmail

00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:13,690
address sends me to google to

00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:17,169
authenticate one an additional click and

00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:21,220
I'm signed in so I've signed into three

00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:23,350
sites with a total of seven clicks it's

00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,110
very very simple very very easy very low

00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,880
friction and none of these sites are

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,890
receiving a password none of these sites

00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,700
receive any sort of secret that they

00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:35,050
have to worry about storing and securing

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,630
so now when I go to another website ting

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:43,510
which is a mobile phone service provider

00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:45,040
and view us ah the question is was gmail

00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,620
running a special service sorry pause

00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,860
the screencast when it's mid load to

00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:53,800
support persona I'll answer that in just

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,510
a minute but now I browsers seen two

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,430
identities of me of mine my gmail

00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,810
address of my work address and so I'm

00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,460
given this picker where I can very

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,380
simply choose I could add a third

00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,810
address I wanted to or fourth if I can

00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:08,050
choose one click Sign In even if I've

00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:09,550
never previously used that site so

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,030
that's the way persona works it's very

00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:15,610
very simple very very easy to use of

00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:17,380
course I demoed that in Firefox Mozilla

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,000
understands that the web is bigger than

00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,370
any one browser it's bigger than any one

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,800
email provider and it's bigger than any

00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,229
one social network so persona today

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,810
works with any email address on any

00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:31,660
major browser everything from Mobile

00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,220
Safari or Chrome on iOS out to pretty

00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,229
much any browser on android Internet

00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:40,240
Explorer 8 and up work great with

00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:42,910
persona and what you effectively get is

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,440
a button that lets you sign users into

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,360
your site with their email address but

00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,030
without you having to worry about

00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,219
storing receiving touching passwords at

00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:53,080
all because when you put persona behind

00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:55,000
that button persona intelligently routes

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,789
your users to an appropriate login

00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,430
endpoint for Mozilla users for Mozilla

00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:02,819
employees we go login against our

00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:05,740
corporate ldap server for Gmail users

00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:07,689
their login against Google Yahoo against

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,759
Yahoo and it only gets better so you

00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:11,289
implement persona once and you already

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,379
have a strict superset of all of these

00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:16,599
social providers and any domain at any

00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:20,169
time can advertise support for persona

00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:21,930
and immediately start receiving users

00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:25,150
and having people directed to it of

00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:26,469
course if you use an address say your

00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,779
own corporate address that doesn't

00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:30,789
support persona persona is configured to

00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:32,279
fall back to a normal email challenge so

00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:35,199
we send you a link you click on it

00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:36,279
you've proven your address done so the

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,990
same sort of thing that you would have

00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:39,490
to implement yourself if you wanted to

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,960
support an email address persona does by

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:45,370
default but for domains that support it

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,469
users have an enhanced smoother flow

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:52,330
that works with their existing

00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:54,310
authentication endpoints of course like

00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,839
everything mozilla does personas open

00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,150
source and like the web itself it's

00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,560
decentralized we're not trying to get

00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,789
between you and your users we're trying

00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,159
to define a protocol that the browser

00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:06,430
itself can use to figure out how and

00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:07,960
where to authenticate you so today

00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,699
persona exists as web service today

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,560
persona is a reference implementation of

00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:13,539
a protocol but our ambitions are much

00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,000
more audacious we want persona to become

00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:17,919
the next standard for authentication on

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,060
the web we want persona to be baked into

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,039
browsers and we're going to start

00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,259
leading in that direction early next

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:29,949
year when we start building persona into

00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:31,509
Firefox directly Firefox why why does a

00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:33,490
browser vendor why does Mozilla care

00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:38,440
about passwords why are we trying to to

00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:41,949
address login so though Mozilla is best

00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,290
known for building Firefox we're a

00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:45,730
non-profit we're a global community just

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,199
like the Drupal community representing

00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:50,410
tens of thousands of volunteer

00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:52,240
contributors all over the world we exist

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,520
to make sure that the web remains an

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,370
open and accessible and interoperable

00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:00,940
place that's built on standards not

00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:03,740
solely controlled by advertising firms

00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,840
the Mozilla Foundation the nonprofit

00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:09,110
that Shepherds the direction of the

00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,400
Mozilla projects codifies it's it's

00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,160
worked in the Mozilla manifesto a

00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,240
ten-point manifesto of the open lab this

00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,700
was developed at the height of the

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,530
browser wars when the internet explorer

00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,790
Netscape divide threatened to split the

00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:24,170
internet into mutually incompatible

00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:25,820
realms but some of these points number

00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,110
two that the Internet is a global public

00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,420
resource that must remain open and

00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,490
accessible apply much more broadly than

00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,200
just two browsers number for individual

00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,210
security on the internet is fundamental

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,060
and cannot be taken for granted or

00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,590
cannot be treated as optional number

00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,030
five individuals must have the ability

00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,280
to shape their own experiences on the

00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:44,960
internet each one of these points each

00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,050
one of these bullets in our manifesto

00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,910
apply equally to the browser Wars as

00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:52,550
they do to identity each one of these is

00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:55,190
facing a grave threat social authentic

00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,550
and authentication threatens to split

00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,540
the internet and close it off completely

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,340
eliminate the ability for certain

00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,230
classes of people to access entire

00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,640
classes of websites if you live in a

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,960
country that blocks facebook you cannot

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,250
login to a site that uses Facebook

00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:12,080
Connect furthermore social off Rob's

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,910
users of the ability to choose who they

00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,780
trust who they are and how they

00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:19,160
represent themselves on the internet and

00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,560
passwords security it is extremely

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:25,160
difficult extremely difficult to do

00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:27,550
security correctly is there a question

00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,550
in the back

00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:35,800
so what about country is blocking

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:37,960
Mozilla part of that comes in to the

00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,150
idea of persona being decentralized so

00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,150
there is no necessary point that flows

00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:44,650
through Mozilla I'll discuss the

00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,580
protocol at the end of the talk so yeah

00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,980
if you have further questions please

00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:55,510
feel free raise your hand or bring those

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:58,900
up whenever so let's look at where we

00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:00,460
come authentication is hard citation is

00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,860
really hard this is what a login screen

00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,600
looked like 25 years ago and you can

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,370
recognize as a login screen because as

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,550
an email address and a password field

00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:14,500
that's why user ID at prodigy what's my

00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:16,330
password and a sign-in button here's a

00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,400
login screen today you can recognize as

00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:19,840
login screens as those same two fields

00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,130
so the way that we've logged into

00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,240
websites the way that we authenticate on

00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,880
the Internet has not changed

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,010
meaningfully in a quarter century but

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,530
what has changed is the frequency and

00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:34,810
the quantity of sites that we login to

00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:36,430
you passwords are paying passwords are

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,589
fatiguing they're difficult to use and

00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:41,320
we're using them more so so what are our

00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:42,460
alternatives some sites like strava have

00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,140
started offering something like a

00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:46,140
facebook connect button or Google button

00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,760
this is this is nice from a user

00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,560
experience standpoint if I'm willing to

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,330
use Facebook I don't have to worry about

00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,280
passwords but it changes the

00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,680
authentication question into one of not

00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,450
do I want to log into strava but it

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,420
turns into a trust question do I trust

00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:06,100
strava to act responsibly with the

00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,650
information that I am forced to disclose

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,210
as part of logging in with facebook do I

00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:13,660
trust them with my social graph do I

00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:17,740
trust them with my name my photo my list

00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:19,210
of friends and I'm only given the option

00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,520
of facebook if I want to log in with my

00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:23,380
gmail address I would have to again

00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,180
shoulder the burden of managing a

00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,740
password and I'd have to hope that

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,540
strava does the right thing and stores

00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,190
that password using an appropriate

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,870
hashing function using appropriate

00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:34,450
salting using appropriate work factors

00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,440
and I can't be sure of that just like

00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,320
they can't be sure that I choose a

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,730
strong password so what do you do I

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,070
don't I don't have choice here I don't

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,750
have meaningful choice Stack Overflow

00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,980
just adds more buttons

00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,860
so I can choose Google I can choose

00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,600
yahoo i can choose facebook there are

00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,590
there are literally a dozen buttons on

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,040
this page when i started giving this

00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:56,140
talk there were 13 the button on the

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,700
kind of far bottom left the little green

00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,040
circle with an eye on it that's my open

00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,500
ID that's shutting down I believe in

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,800
February of next year so soon this will

00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:09,340
be 11 buttons which is which is a

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,750
problem but how do I even pick a button

00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:14,110
I have an account literally with every

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,250
single one of these providers how do I

00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,050
pick the right one how do I pick the

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,770
same one when I come back two weeks

00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:22,090
later two months later two years later

00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:24,280
but it's more than a user experience

00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:27,910
problems social off your only providing

00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:29,770
users options that you yourself select

00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,210
there's only a whitelist that each site

00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,560
will select so if I want to login to

00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,930
stack overflow using my github account

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,020
or using my Twitter account I don't have

00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:39,640
that option I have to choose between one

00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,370
of those one of those pre-selected

00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,620
services and when you suggest that your

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,820
users when you force your users to log

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,060
in with something like Google+ or

00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:51,010
Facebook you're saying that you as a

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,320
site owner is a site builder accept the

00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,600
fact that you're going to be phoning

00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,760
home to a for-profit corporation half a

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,820
world away and asking for permission to

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,320
talk to your own users it is that you're

00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,700
fine with things like a real name policy

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,080
the Google+ and Facebook have that you

00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,490
have to use your real name if your real

00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,140
name is insufficiently Western that you

00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:11,020
have to provide paperwork to prove that

00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:15,160
it is your name or they will kick you

00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:16,839
out it appears that your name does not

00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,760
comply with the Google+ real name policy

00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:20,080
or Google+ names policy it will be

00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,850
suspended until you edit your name to

00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,280
comply or appeal with additional

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,430
information social off means you're

00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,240
accepting imposing the whims of

00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,070
third-party terms of service on your

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,570
users and accepting the fact that if

00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,430
your users get banned from Google+ or

00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,110
banned from facebook that you're fine

00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,300
with them being unable to access your

00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:39,430
own site but maybe it's worth it to get

00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:44,620
rid of passwords social off does get rid

00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:47,950
of passwords quite well but shouldn't

00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:52,660
have to mean giving up privacy whoever's

00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:55,870
getting this email at least one hand

00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,800
yeah yeah that was unfortunate for those

00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,110
of you that are not

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,700
earlier with the issue on page 42 of the

00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:03,370
drupal watchdog magazine that you got in

00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,290
your swag bag Holly Ross discusses

00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,760
Drupal orgs response the Drupal

00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:09,370
associations response to the drupal.org

00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:12,850
compromise under the heading the

00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:14,140
immediate aftermath she writes we were

00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,850
very fortunate that members of the

00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,260
Drupal security team were on hand along

00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,880
with the drupal.org infrastructure team

00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,100
and Oregon State University's

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,510
open-source lab to diagnose the severity

00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,279
of the problem mitigate the issues

00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,899
technically and worked with drupal

00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:28,300
association staff to formulate and

00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:29,829
implement a public response the team

00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,510
went to work immediately to determine

00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:33,550
the scope and severity of the issue they

00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:35,019
took down non-essential sites they

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,190
combed logs for more information

00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:38,110
searched file uploads for anything

00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:41,860
suspicious checked the integrity of

00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:43,240
project downloads the infrastructure

00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,890
team started rebuilding servers that

00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,959
have been affected the team also

00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:48,790
deployed pH past password hashing

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,490
removed admin access for not active

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:54,779
users and then with all of all of that

00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:57,100
done the scope and the breach identified

00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:59,890
the next step was to execute the

00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:03,370
password reset geo are you sitting or

00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:07,899
you have a question so that is an

00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:09,790
absolutely exemplary response the drupal

00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:12,730
association brought to bear an amazing

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:16,500
team quickly competently and effectively

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:20,770
to mitigate the loss of the drupal org

00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:22,060
account database unfortunately I don't

00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,649
know about you but I don't think this

00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:27,459
generalizes I don't think most people

00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:31,810
have time or resources or money or even

00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:33,310
the awareness to properly respond to an

00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:35,320
event like that to a compromise like

00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:37,000
that and so not only is it challenging

00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,560
to do that if you're managing a couple

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,720
dozen sites how do you do this for each

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,570
one how do you even know when it's like

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,220
it's compromised it's also problem

00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,839
because about the best password policy

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,459
you can hope your users have is that

00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,980
book right there if your users are

00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:53,920
writing down their passwords they are

00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,660
well beyond well better than most people

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,820
on the internet today most people on the

00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:00,279
internet memorize three maybe four

00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:03,130
passwords and maybe have slight

00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:04,650
variations from site to site which means

00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:08,169
that when drupal.org was compromised

00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:10,390
sure that database leaked but it leaked

00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:12,339
in a way that allowed most or

00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,680
least many of the passwords to be

00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:16,660
reversed out of their hash which put

00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,600
users at risk at every other site where

00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,280
they had reused that same password and

00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,320
so even though drupal.org did the right

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,630
thing in resetting passwords and making

00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:28,000
people come up with new ones it still

00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,500
leaves countless people at risk on

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,030
countless other websites and there is

00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,470
nothing that you as a site owner there's

00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:35,080
nothing that you as a user can do to

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:39,190
mitigate this you have to know that a

00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:41,800
site got breached a lot of sites aren't

00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,480
as forthcoming about what happens and

00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,560
what about use a site owner even if

00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,630
you're doing everything right you're

00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,160
using s crypt using per-user salts you

00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,750
have an appropriate work factor you're

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,660
storing an additional assault outside of

00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,920
the database that the application uses

00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,780
none of that matters if someone is able

00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,030
to learn the plaintext of your users

00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:03,610
passwords through another source there

00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:08,890
is no way to win with passwords so what

00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:11,950
can you do i hope i hope that using

00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:13,810
mozilla persona is one of the things

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:16,000
that you consider on the next site you

00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,400
build if drupal.org have been using

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,570
persona there would have never been

00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,490
anything derived from a password to

00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,870
steal in the first place that breach

00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:26,950
could not have resulted in the

00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:28,990
collateral damage that it did so how's

00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,130
it work I've told you that persona gets

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,780
for the passwords I've told you that

00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,920
Mozilla doesn't want to be a part of

00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,900
this missoula doesn't want to be in the

00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:38,170
middle of you and your users but what's

00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:40,210
actually going on in any login

00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:42,040
transaction there are three parties your

00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:44,680
browser your email provider and the site

00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,610
that you want to log into you the first

00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,260
thing your browser does we're using

00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,820
completely standard public key crypto

00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,160
your browser generates a public/private

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,810
key pair and presents the public key to

00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,690
the email provider and ask them to sign

00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:57,340
a proof of identity that says hey gmail

00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:00,330
can you please certify that I really am

00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:03,730
who I say really am who I say I am and

00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:05,230
if so you get a signed certificate back

00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,030
the browser stores at and it can then

00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:09,520
present that certificate to websites as

00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:11,410
a proof of identity of course that

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,420
website has to verify the certificate is

00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,470
a legitimate so much like if someone

00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,520
showed you a driver's license you have

00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,800
to check to make sure it has the right

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,810
holograms make sure that it's not you

00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,490
know some cheap forgery so the website

00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,720
requests the public key from from the

00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:24,010
email provider verifies the

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,470
cryptographic signature is

00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,790
if it all checks out they can sign the

00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,250
user end they never have to store a

00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,690
secret never have to store a password

00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,160
the nice thing is once the browser has a

00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:36,190
valid certificate until that certificate

00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,540
expires that user can log into as many

00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,450
sites as they want without having to go

00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,770
and talk to their email provider again

00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,990
what's more the email providers can cash

00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:46,090
the public keys that they get which

00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,530
means that sometimes the email provider

00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:50,560
doesn't have to be contacted at all

00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:52,150
during the login transaction even when

00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,330
the email provider is contacted persona

00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:57,160
never reveals the protocol never reveals

00:19:54,330 --> 00:20:00,190
who you are who's trying to sign in all

00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,290
the email provider learns is that one of

00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:03,760
my users has tried to sign into the site

00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:06,070
but they don't have a way to figure out

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,890
who so it's much more privacy protecting

00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:12,340
Social off than open ID and it's

00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:13,980
actually extremely easy to implement but

00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,060
it relies on all three parties

00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,760
understanding and implementing the

00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,350
percent of protocol if the browser

00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,820
doesn't support persona no problem we

00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,530
have a polyfill we have a JavaScript

00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:26,350
shim you include in your page it works

00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:27,970
on any browser if the email provider

00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,980
doesn't support persona and this is how

00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:32,280
this is how we're able to claim that

00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,420
persona supports any email address today

00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,150
the browser will still do the first same

00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:40,330
step will say hey email provider can you

00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:41,410
please vouch for me but that will fail

00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:45,160
because the email provider doesn't

00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:48,040
understand the protocol as a convention

00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:50,050
Mozilla can step in and verify people

00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,280
for you so the browser will try that

00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,750
same request but we'll go to Mozilla and

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,280
say hey Mozilla can you vouch for me

00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:57,730
until my email provider can do it

00:20:54,280 --> 00:21:00,070
themselves at which point Mozilla sends

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,780
an email to that user they click on the

00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:05,410
link proving to Mozilla their identity

00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:07,450
and the Mozilla signs a certificate same

00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,980
flow repeats user presents a certificate

00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,360
of site the site tries to request the

00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,220
public key from the actual email

00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,070
provider so we try the decentralized

00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:17,650
path first we try to keep Mozilla out of

00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:19,900
the loop and if that fails then the site

00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:22,330
can opt to fall back and check Mozilla's

00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,240
key and everything checks out then if

00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:28,210
the site trusts and believes in Mozilla

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:31,030
then the user can lot be logged in if at

00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:32,440
any point a domain stands up and says I

00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:34,180
can vouch for my own users now and

00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,120
that's as simple as publishing a JSON

00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:38,080
document on the root of your domain

00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,330
Mozilla immediately drops out of the

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,250
picture automatically we have carefully

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,840
designed this protocol not to be

00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,250
something that puts us in the middle of

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,230
your login transactions to put to be

00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:50,740
something that any individual part of it

00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:52,540
can immediately and automatically be

00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,070
replaced by a decentralized alternative

00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,300
as soon as that becomes available

00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,190
without any additional configuration

00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:02,170
without any additional work on behalf of

00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:03,970
site owners or browsers four steps can

00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:08,200
you please certify my identity thank you

00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:09,970
here's the proof site verifies it what

00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,320
we've built is we've built truly

00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:13,360
friendly public key cryptography it's

00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,980
dead simple both for users and

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,470
developers you saw what looked like your

00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,570
users Jonathan can tell you about the

00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:26,080
drupal module it's like there's a

00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:27,340
question in the back hmm so yeah the

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,870
question is the logic of the pop-up

00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,480
window is that on Mozilla site it is

00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:33,910
right now personas implemented as a

00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,530
JavaScript API and so the plan is in the

00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,090
future browsers will have a native

00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:39,060
implementation of that API in the same

00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:41,430
way that you have a geolocation API and

00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:44,470
for now we provide a JavaScript shim

00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:46,390
that uses persona org to provide the UI

00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,820
but if you're using a browser that has

00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:50,680
built-in support all of that interface

00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:53,350
will be hosted directly by your local

00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,640
browser so that's one of the other

00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:56,590
things we built so you can just very

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,650
very automatically and easily does

00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,810
navigator ID exist yes ok ignore ignore

00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:04,090
everything @ % org use the native

00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:07,810
browsers parts we're trying to write

00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:09,100
ourselves out of the protocol and so we

00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,870
can work without browser support we can

00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,550
work without support from email

00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:15,100
providers we have polyfills we have a

00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:16,390
fallback what we cannot do and this is

00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,370
where the Drupal community comes in this

00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,020
is why it's so important that the Drupal

00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:22,060
community support persona is that we

00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:24,490
can't force websites to accept this

00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:27,160
credential we can't force websites to

00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,390
leave passwords behind and so it's

00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,040
incumbent on everyone in this room if

00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:34,270
you believe the open web deserves better

00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:36,850
and start with yourself use persona on

00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:39,040
your own site spread the word let

00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:42,130
mozilla know let me know what we can do

00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:44,230
better persona is still in beta we're

00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,429
responsive we're very interested in

00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,110
building what is right for the web and

00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:49,480
we can't do that alone we can only do

00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:51,360
that with a feedback and the input from

00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:55,060
communities like

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,650
so that's persona at a high level I'm

00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,450
going to pass things off to to Johnny so

00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:16,570
we can demo how the drupal module works

00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:17,440
take one question real quick right so

00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:19,060
the question is how do you invalidate

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,130
once once you've signed into a website

00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,570
once using persona how do you invalidate

00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:26,050
your browser's knowledge of your

00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:27,610
identity when you sign into the website

00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:29,800
you receive an identity certificate that

00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,390
is time limited it never lasts for more

00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,740
than a day usually lasts for closer to

00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:34,750
one hour the first time you use persona

00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,360
extending up to around six hours as you

00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:38,940
continue using it and so if nothing else

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,870
even if you walk away from the computer

00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,790
several hours later the certificate

00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:44,650
expires and if someone wanted to use

00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:46,510
that machine they would then be prompted

00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,860
to log into your email again so as long

00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,060
as you're signed out of your email it

00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:58,630
takes here itself based on just

00:24:49,060 --> 00:25:00,910
expiration right so if you're logged

00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:02,530
into Google and your persona certificate

00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:04,000
expires but you still have an active

00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:05,080
session with Google the browser can

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,090
automatically go and get a new one

00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,000
without any user interaction so it's

00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,800
designed to automatically extend and

00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,660
unlike many public key based identity

00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,700
solutions or crypto solutions like PGP

00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,050
where the root of your identity is

00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,820
within this key pair that you have to

00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:21,010
guard and keep secret and synchronized

00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:23,200
with persona the root of your identity

00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:25,180
is with your email provider so with any

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,910
domain that you choose that's where your

00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:29,260
identity isn't by logging in there you

00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:30,970
can automatically receive additional

00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:33,790
certificates additional proofs of

00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:37,260
identity any other quick questions

00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:37,260
before we bounce over the Drupal

00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:55,530
so the question is does persona actually

00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:58,980
generate the the key pair for the user

00:25:55,530 --> 00:26:00,720
or how does that work so persona depends

00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,669
on a pretty decent JavaScript

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,500
implementation because we actually do

00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:06,299
generate a public/private key pair

00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:10,890
locally in the browser using javascript

00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:13,710
and so as a user the keeper using never

00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:15,090
leaves your local machine you present

00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:17,130
the pub key to the email provider they

00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:20,669
sign that and then again locally your

00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:22,320
browser store is the the certificate the

00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:23,940
the core difference between persona and

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,380
something like open ideas that we

00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,929
presume that the browser is an active

00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,669
participant in the login process and is

00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:30,990
able to actually you computation which

00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:32,640
allows us to build some really

00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:42,960
interesting privacy-preserving features

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:44,190
into persona question is do we see this

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,690
being implemented in the operating

00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:48,030
system level or just an environment

00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:51,179
outside of the browser at any point not

00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:53,490
necessarily we're very narrowly scoped

00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:55,320
and trying to solve authentication on

00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,580
the web when humans are in the loop so

00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,520
persona is also not great if you're

00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,929
doing something that's API centric but

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,090
you could take something like the route

00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:05,400
that Amazon does where you sign in to a

00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:08,720
website as a human using something like

00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,710
persona and then receive an API key for

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,360
for that sort of access but as far as

00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:14,789
building into the browser or into the

00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:16,770
operating system not necessarily we have

00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:18,360
built it into Firefox OS so if you have

00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:21,020
a Firefox OS phone that has a native

00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:24,210
implementation of persona right on board

00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:25,530
but that's kind of blurring the lines

00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:31,409
because Firefox of us is itself

00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:33,690
effectively just a browser cool I'm sort

00:27:31,409 --> 00:27:34,919
of section at the end yeah so Drupal

00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,929
demo and then happy to take more

00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,309
questions also I have stickers up front

00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:41,510
so at the end of the talk please come by

00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:41,510
and grab some thank you

00:27:45,620 --> 00:28:01,980
okay so now for the live demo okay so

00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:05,390
this this is the the project page for

00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:13,190
the module so that's just drupal.org /

00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:16,860
projects / persona and I've created a

00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:20,490
demo site um so this is just a very

00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:22,860
simple Drupal installation and it has

00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:26,870
persona installed so I'm just going to

00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:32,340
sign in just to show you how it works so

00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:37,880
we can sign in it already knows my email

00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:37,880
address um i'm going to add another one

00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:53,780
so it it's going to check yahoo com

00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:56,600
mozilla have implemented a connection

00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:59,150
with with with yahoo so if i want to

00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:10,040
sign in I can just type in my yahoo

00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:13,690
password so that that quickly I was able

00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,690
to sign in to the website

00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:27,360
okay so I have a couple of other example

00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:31,039
sites so this this is my my personal

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,389
blog and of course if you've got a blog

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:36,029
you don't necessarily want to enable

00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:39,119
anonymous commenting because then you

00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:40,799
can get a lot of spam but if if you if

00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,740
you require people to sign into your

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:46,559
blog in order to post that's that's

00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:51,330
quite a high barrier to entry so on my

00:29:46,559 --> 00:30:00,629
blog I've enabled persona so again I can

00:29:51,330 --> 00:30:07,919
I can sign in and as easy as that I can

00:30:00,629 --> 00:30:10,230
i can start commenting so in the Drupal

00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,850
community and we have a lot of really

00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:14,999
great ecommerce solutions so one of

00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:18,090
those is the the Commerce module and

00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:21,779
there is a distribution called comic

00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:23,730
commerce kickstart so this is a stock

00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:26,850
install of commerce kick starts and then

00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:29,090
I've added the persona module so I'm

00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:34,499
going to show you how easy it is to use

00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:36,990
persona in an e-commerce setting okay so

00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:40,350
let's let's find a product that i want

00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:44,360
to buy i'm going to buy this water

00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:44,360
bottle add to cart

00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:52,500
go to check out and then before I

00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:55,440
complete the transaction I just want to

00:30:52,500 --> 00:31:05,910
sign in just so they have my email

00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:08,600
address so i click Sign In and select my

00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,600
my email

00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:19,260
and that quickly I'm signed in and

00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:22,470
drupal commerce is smart enough so it's

00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:27,950
it's transferred my my cart into the new

00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:30,210
session and then I can go to check out

00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:37,650
so I think you can really optimize your

00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:41,910
funnel if you use persona ok so this is

00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:43,410
a stock drupal 7 installation so I'm

00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:47,180
just going to install the module and

00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:47,180
then show you what what it's capable of

00:31:50,810 --> 00:32:04,430
so you download the module in the

00:31:53,610 --> 00:32:04,430
regular fashion enable the module

00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:14,050
and the module is set up so by default

00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:23,320
it puts the the Sign In button into the

00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:26,380
header region in your theme so if I sign

00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:33,730
right we now have a persona sign-in

00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:37,480
button so I'm going to sign in my I'm in

00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:39,910
a client on this website uses my my j

00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:46,990
brown eyed blue droplet com email so i

00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:56,010
can i can just sign in and it's that

00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:59,380
simple so the persona module it actually

00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:02,350
it looks at your drupal user or client

00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:05,560
settings so drupal can be configured to

00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:08,260
only lie administrators to create create

00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:11,350
a client's or you can you can allow

00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:13,930
visitors to create a client's on your

00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:16,570
website so the persona module just looks

00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:19,210
at this setting so if if you live

00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:21,340
visitors to sign in then if a new user

00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:23,830
comes to your website with persona to

00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:25,450
sign in then their their their site on

00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:27,990
the drupal website is just created

00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,990
transparently

00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:38,529
and this is the settings page for the

00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:41,380
module so the first setting is set

00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:44,500
persona as the only sign in method so by

00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:46,500
default the module allows you to use

00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:49,240
Drupal standard sign-in methods or

00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,909
persona and you can switch between those

00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:55,360
and that that's fine if you enable this

00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:58,960
option then it disables the sign in

00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:06,940
blocks disables the the menu roots and

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:08,859
all that sort of thing yeah so if I sigh

00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:13,659
night having enable that option the

00:34:08,859 --> 00:34:17,980
designing dialogue is gone and you can

00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:23,919
if you if you just go to the user URL

00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:26,369
you can also sign in there or you should

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:26,369
be able to

00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:37,040
hmm

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:43,899
I don't know ah invalid background color

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:43,899
okay I can fix this in a moment

00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,609
okay so I've reenabled the module

00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:49,990
I will explain so am there is a setting

00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:53,230
where you can configure the background

00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:54,849
color so I think it's just a problem

00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:57,310
with this form it just wasn't storing

00:35:54,849 --> 00:35:59,349
the value correctly but I think if I

00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:04,119
actually specify the color then that

00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:05,920
should work fine so there's there's a

00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:08,820
number of options that control the

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:12,880
appearance of this sign in dialogue so

00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:14,589
you can specify a logo the only

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,190
requirement is that the logo has to be

00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:22,270
served over HTTPS because the sign in

00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:24,820
dialogue itself is served over HTTPS you

00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:27,099
can configure the background color and

00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:31,900
then you can provide links to Terms of

00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:34,240
Service and Privacy Policy so hopefully

00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:38,619
now that i have defined the background

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:43,869
color we should get a background color

00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:45,130
yep so it's working so again the

00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:46,750
beautiful thing about open source is

00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:48,369
that this is an opportunity for anyone

00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,140
in this room to fix the bug with the

00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:57,790
background color not being initialized

00:36:50,140 --> 00:37:01,839
in the module by default so there's a

00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:03,880
few other options in the module so you

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:06,670
know what happens if someone signs into

00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:09,970
your website for the first time what is

00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:12,220
their username so because you're because

00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:15,640
the account is created automatically the

00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:20,200
username is automatically generated so

00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:22,780
by default it just takes the start of

00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:26,020
your email address as your username and

00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:28,300
but it may be maybe you just want to use

00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:32,770
email addresses for user names in which

00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:35,050
case you can just enable this option you

00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:36,700
can you can specify it so whenever a

00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:38,980
user signs in for the first time they

00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:41,580
are redirected to the account edit page

00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:45,190
so they can fill out their profile and

00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:47,520
in a moment I'll show you some advanced

00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:49,690
workflows for that so you can actually

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,640
enforce that when someone signs in for

00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:52,839
the first time they have to complete

00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:56,920
their profile before they can do

00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:57,900
anything else you can change the styling

00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,090
of the button

00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:05,740
so if you just set it to button this is

00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:08,670
just a regular button HTML elements you

00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:11,440
can you can thin that however you like

00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:15,850
persona and gives you the persona style

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:18,070
button or if you select form then the

00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:21,540
button is just rendered in the same way

00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:21,540
as any button on a form on your website

00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:31,060
yep it's and it was very easy to

00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:38,520
implement that just a couple of lines in

00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:42,880
the in the form and it it is translated

00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:45,820
so there is a module I think it's called

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:53,470
string overrides and so you can you can

00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:56,140
change it there okay um so there is an

00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:58,590
advanced workflow using the the rules

00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,590
module

00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:08,510
so I just created a couple of rules and

00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:10,490
so it may be when someone signs in for

00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:13,790
the first time you don't want them to be

00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:16,490
able to do anything until they until

00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:18,710
they've completed their profile so just

00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:24,290
by creating a couple of rules i was able

00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:29,180
to do that so whenever they complete

00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:32,180
their their their profile and they given

00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:33,860
a new user rule so you can have a role

00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:36,230
called registered so instead of giving

00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:38,870
all of the permissions to the

00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:40,460
authenticated user role you might want

00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:43,430
to have the same permissions for

00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:45,470
authenticated user as anonymous user but

00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:47,120
then have a registered role and then

00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:50,810
give all the additional permissions to

00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:53,750
to that role so the rule then it gives

00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:55,640
you the registered roll it gives you a

00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:58,700
message thanks for registering and then

00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:05,930
redirects you to the front page of the

00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:08,960
website this role just checks so

00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:11,840
whenever Drupal is initializing and if

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:16,610
you have the authenticated user role but

00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:19,610
you don't have the registered role then

00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:22,790
it just redirects you to your user at a

00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:29,900
page so i'll just show you a demo with

00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:37,550
that so let's sign out and sign in as a

00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:39,140
new user so there there is no user on on

00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:41,170
this website with with this email

00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,170
address

00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:53,890
so we've been redirected to the edit

00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:56,979
page so we have to complete our our

00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:58,869
profile so all being well if I try to go

00:40:56,979 --> 00:41:01,769
anywhere else on the website I am

00:40:58,869 --> 00:41:04,569
redirected to the the edit profile page

00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:07,390
and this this date of birth field is

00:41:04,569 --> 00:41:09,160
actually a required field so if I I try

00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:11,680
to save the form I can't do that until

00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:21,989
until I've answered all of the required

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:25,839
information so if if I enable the

00:41:21,989 --> 00:41:29,519
takeover option and that form actually

00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:29,519
those form atoms actually disappear

00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:44,180
so the question is will % eventually

00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,650
support transferring profile attributes

00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:49,250
like a full name or a photo for the

00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:51,620
users right now we're very very directly

00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:53,240
focused solely on proving email

00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:54,470
addresses and letting sites collect

00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,390
whatever additional information they

00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,650
need so we suggest a two-phase if you

00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:59,270
need some of that information if you

00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:00,740
absolutely require two phase off the

00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:02,540
process where these are signs in with

00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:05,360
persona and then you present them with a

00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:07,280
minimal sign up form that just asked for

00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,300
that additional information the nice

00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,370
thing about that is that you can kind of

00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:12,410
you have an intermediate point in your

00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:14,390
funnel bring users into your site so

00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:16,040
people hit that form and then bail out

00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:17,990
you still captured your email address

00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,120
and are able to ask them what was up and

00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:21,800
maybe retain some of those users but

00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,930
right now just for user experience

00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,540
reasons presented is really concerned

00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:33,920
with replacing passwords and not much

00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:36,500
else so just just going back to your

00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,530
your previous point I'm just going to

00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:42,730
enable the takeover sign an option and

00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:42,730
show you what happens to the form

00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:12,140
okay so if I enabled sarasota as the

00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:14,860
only sign in method and then I switch to

00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,860
the other user

00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:33,890
I try to edit my accounts there's no

00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:36,650
password field so one other thing I'm

00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:38,660
just going to demo is what happens if

00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:40,460
you have an account on a Drupal website

00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:43,580
and then you want to change your email

00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:45,830
address for that account so I've added

00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:51,670
some functionality to the module and for

00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:54,260
for that so I'll just delete this user

00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:57,349
perhaps I created it by accident I

00:43:54,260 --> 00:44:03,950
actually want this email address to be

00:43:57,349 --> 00:44:07,760
the administrator email address so I can

00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:09,859
go to my account just on my my userpage

00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:13,099
there is a change email button so i can

00:44:09,859 --> 00:44:21,440
just click on that select my other email

00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:23,270
address and all being well that should

00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,710
become my email address for this our

00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:26,710
clients on this drupal website

00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:38,250
and the username is only populated

00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:44,880
whenever you create their client

00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:48,109
actually and it's now insisting that I

00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,109
create my profile

00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:59,960
yeah yeah

00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:08,670
yeah so the changing email that didn't

00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:13,660
actually work but we can fix that okay

00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:16,510
so that's that's the end of the demo so

00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:20,500
I I just wanted to give you some some

00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:24,190
takeaways so whenever you create a new

00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:25,840
Drupal websites um maybe maybe a persona

00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:27,100
should be the first module that you

00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:30,490
install after after you've installed

00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:33,060
Drupal in the Drupal community and we

00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:35,350
also have a lot of distributions so

00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:37,780
every time there's a drupalcon or a

00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:40,540
drupalcamp there's a distribution called

00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:42,880
cod which is used so it'll be really

00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:45,100
wonderful if the persona module was in

00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,080
cod and then anytime you're signing up

00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:50,170
for a Drupal event you could just sign

00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:52,570
in very easily there's also drupal

00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:56,680
commerce there's triple comment drupal

00:45:52,570 --> 00:46:00,330
commons and also commerce kickstart so

00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:03,580
if if you're interested in using persona

00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:04,900
maybe you should talk to the people who

00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:08,370
are responsible for for these

00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:12,370
distributions and kindly ask that they

00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:14,050
enable a persona by default and also if

00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:16,060
you're building if you're building a

00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:18,790
website for a client maybe you should

00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:21,610
tell them about persona and just just

00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:25,690
ask if if they want to use persona for

00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:26,980
their website ok so I think I think

00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:30,880
we're going to have a question and

00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:34,120
answer session yes I think we have about

00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:38,140
10 minutes to do Q&A one thing to note

00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:40,290
before we go into that is due to do to

00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,290
you

00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:51,960
don't forget to go and fill out the the

00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:53,660
survey about what you thought about this

00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,040
presentation so we get some feedback on

00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:58,530
you know what what the right message is

00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:24,660
for the Drupal community but I'm happy

00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:27,000
to take questions yeah because of the

00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:30,089
social logins that we used to wear we're

00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,450
also used as both website users and also

00:47:30,089 --> 00:47:34,770
website graders as relying on some of

00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:37,230
this profile information the fact that

00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:38,940
it fills out people's avatars it fills

00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:42,540
out all sorts of things how can we

00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:45,359
persuade clients or the people we work

00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:47,339
for or or users themselves that may be

00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:49,530
with or even the companies like Facebook

00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:51,480
or Google that we should have this

00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:53,040
two-step process where login should be

00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,200
like a key to the front door and then

00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,400
maybe afterwards you fill in your

00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,809
profile information which should be

00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,210
separate but I think that's going to be

00:47:57,809 --> 00:48:01,440
a really tough argument to make when all

00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,470
the websites would be making for the

00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,880
past few years have always relied on

00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:07,770
taking that Facebook information taking

00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,480
all the other stuff out of it so yeah

00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:11,400
what do we do to to make sure this is

00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,559
actually taken up as a standard for that

00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,630
so you're still presuming that you're

00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:16,920
actually receiving that you're actually

00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:18,119
getting users through your funnel that

00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,260
people aren't seeing the facebook and

00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:23,160
seeing the the fact that it makes it a

00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:24,839
trust question and backing away and

00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,160
there's nothing wrong with having

00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:28,500
authentication with persona and then

00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,089
asking users to authorize a social

00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,790
account to pull an additional profile

00:48:30,089 --> 00:48:34,980
data air B&B does effectively that you

00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:36,690
log in with an email and password but

00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:39,359
then you can connect your Linkedin your

00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:41,040
Facebook your Twitter account something

00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:43,589
you can do is obviously knew something

00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,210
like gravatar to pull images for user

00:48:43,589 --> 00:48:47,400
email addresses because you get an email

00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:48,839
address there's no locking with persona

00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:52,440
you can use your existing user data

00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:53,640
database you can move to persona very

00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,690
easily you can move away from pursuing

00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:59,040
easily you have email addresses portable

00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:03,000
slob logged out it was a blogging

00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:05,640
platform by a this guy out in Germany

00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,080
and if I sign into that with something

00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,270
that they've never seen before have you

00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:12,600
ever signed into law blog ok cool so

00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:15,360
he's one of Jonathan's addresses triple

00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,500
no matted yahoo when I sign in it goes

00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:19,200
and verifies with Yahoo that I still

00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,370
have an active session so if Jonathan

00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,420
was signed out of yahoo this goes back

00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:22,980
to the earlier question about sessions

00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,780
if he had signed out of yahoo in the

00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,040
interim that would have failed it would

00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:29,340
have asked him to type in his password

00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:30,870
again Slava looks like well wait a

00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,950
second I've never seen you before it

00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:34,260
looks like you haven't used this address

00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:37,170
yet please pick a username and it's

00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:41,220
prefilled a suggested username based on

00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:42,840
the email address a lot of a lot of

00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:45,230
email addresses take the form of first

00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:47,940
name dot last name be a dis dis

00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:49,950
discourse platform it's jeff Atwoods new

00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:51,240
startup does the same sort of thing

00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:52,560
where it tries to intelligently guess if

00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:55,560
there is one dot in the email address

00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:58,110
split that capitalize the two words and

00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:59,790
suggest that as the full name so there

00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:01,560
are things you can do to provide saying

00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:03,440
defaults and can then just give your

00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:06,030
users a chance to confirm and continue

00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,590
but if you really rely on deep profile

00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:09,000
data if that's crucial to your business

00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:12,770
and capturing at sign up as crucial

00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,770
person it may not be the right solution

00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:23,940
other questions and we chargin it

00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:27,690
earlier but with the sort of questions

00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:30,690
in the middle if you are locked into

00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:33,060
various sites using persona and then you

00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:34,710
want to give your computer someone else

00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:36,900
immediately how can you make sure they

00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:40,050
don't have access your user accounts on

00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:41,600
those sites um so if you want to wanted

00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:43,650
and your computer or someone immediately

00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,750
sunny out being it would time actually

00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:47,940
but you know that the time that's not

00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:50,280
going to be enough mr. I was sent to

00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:51,270
logout function there is you can so when

00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,560
this is built in the browser you will

00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:53,760
have a sign out button in the browser

00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,870
that will immediately validate

00:50:53,760 --> 00:51:00,930
everything if you in a persona dialog

00:50:56,870 --> 00:51:03,090
click this is not me that will also

00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:07,710
immediately trash all of your

00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:10,410
certificates and force a revalidation we

00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:14,340
have data from Google about shared

00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:16,320
devices and effectively computers people

00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,770
like the internet cafe scenario

00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,810
something that

00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:20,130
people also are concerned about and we

00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:21,380
start by issuing very very short

00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:25,140
duration certificates for that reason

00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:26,280
but we have evidence that when computers

00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:29,000
are shared or used by multiple people

00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:31,260
they're almost always shared amongst

00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:35,550
known individuals and trusted

00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:37,890
individuals if you're in an internet

00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:40,740
cafe than quite often the computer will

00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:42,360
actually reboot and between users I'm

00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:44,220
thinking also people posting things

00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,790
funny things on Facebook walls on the

00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:52,010
wrong a kind yeah like lock your machine

00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:52,010
it's physical physical security yeah

00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:03,440
yeah so so there are bad machines out

00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:08,400
there that don't reboot between users

00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:14,100
from a study of logins happening to

00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:16,320
Gmail which is a very large in study the

00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:18,150
the shared computer use case the bad

00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:20,790
shared computer use case is practically

00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:23,880
non-existent which is highly

00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:35,220
counterintuitive but it's apparently

00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:37,020
very very rare one question on the user

00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:38,610
interface so currently in the current

00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:43,830
implementation reference implementation

00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:46,730
it comes out as a pop-up is that the is

00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:49,080
that how you see this being implemented

00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:51,750
going forward regardless or could it

00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:55,170
also be say form fields on the site

00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:57,690
itself if it wasn't hosted by Mozilla so

00:52:55,170 --> 00:53:01,080
can we remove an extra step in terms of

00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:05,190
the flow and i'll ask my second question

00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:06,600
in a second sure so we're not entirely

00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:08,940
certain what the user experience will be

00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,140
when it's baked into the browser the the

00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:11,850
kind of default that people reach for

00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:14,880
drop-down panels little door hangers

00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:16,800
kind of like the security dialogue but

00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,320
given that we have to host the login

00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,450
page and so persona doesn't specify at

00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,010
all how you authenticate somos little

00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:27,000
user will login using our ldap password

00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:29,460
a muslim playy a gmail user will login

00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,630
using google's 00 auth kind of

00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,190
authorization screen

00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:33,930
including a two-factor prompt we don't

00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:37,019
dictate how the email providers do

00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:38,430
authentication it has to be pretty

00:53:37,019 --> 00:53:40,019
flexible and so it's likely that it'll

00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:42,720
be a door hanger and overlay or

00:53:40,019 --> 00:53:44,369
something in that vein as far as

00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,200
capturing things on the site we are

00:53:44,369 --> 00:53:48,630
about to extend the API to allow the

00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,460
site to pass into the dialogue the users

00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:52,019
chose an email address so you could

00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,569
prompt the user for an email address on

00:53:52,019 --> 00:53:55,829
your site and when they click Sign In it

00:53:54,569 --> 00:53:57,089
would already be prefilled in the

00:53:55,829 --> 00:54:00,089
persona dialogue and they just have to

00:53:57,089 --> 00:54:02,430
authorize it does the login page have to

00:54:00,089 --> 00:54:04,890
be hosted at Mozilla always is that part

00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:06,900
of the protocol no no now the entire

00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:08,940
protocols designs of it tubidy central

00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:10,890
the entire thing is completely you can

00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:12,450
complete today with as it exists today

00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:14,849
you can complete a login transaction

00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:17,670
without missoula ever being a party to

00:54:14,849 --> 00:54:19,319
any part of the transaction cool and my

00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:20,670
second question is where do you see the

00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:22,799
major attack vectors I mean there's

00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:24,450
always I guess the chance of fishing

00:54:22,799 --> 00:54:29,220
which it oooff doesn't fix or none of

00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:30,539
these systems fix or tackle but where do

00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:32,670
you see the attack vectors I mean what

00:54:30,539 --> 00:54:33,750
happens for example if my email address

00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:36,690
changes like kind of like what's

00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:39,119
happening with Yahoo it gets recycled or

00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:43,049
I lose my domain at some point and I had

00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:45,299
my email there etc right so we believe

00:54:43,049 --> 00:54:49,980
that the the attack vectors the security

00:54:45,299 --> 00:54:51,599
model is roughly equivalent to existing

00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,670
email password systems just without the

00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:55,529
entire password compromised case in the

00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:59,700
picture so if someone owns your email

00:54:55,529 --> 00:55:02,549
address in in terms of domain hijacking

00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:04,500
you let something expire you lose access

00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:07,410
to that to me in some way then the new

00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:09,059
controller of that domain is able to to

00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:10,440
masquerade as you just as they could by

00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:11,849
going and clicking and forgot email link

00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:15,660
ever forgot password link and getting

00:55:11,849 --> 00:55:18,359
that email that's good I can make a

00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:20,369
point there where at the moment even

00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:22,920
even if people aren't using persona if

00:55:20,369 --> 00:55:25,500
someone gets into your email a client

00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:28,680
then basically it's over that can do you

00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:31,380
anything so I think with persona it's

00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:33,329
the same situation you have to protect

00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:35,549
your your email account because that's

00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:37,349
basically your your identity is there

00:55:35,549 --> 00:55:39,299
any possibility to actually say kind of

00:55:37,349 --> 00:55:41,130
like the sign out but not a sign out to

00:55:39,299 --> 00:55:42,420
say well this email address has been

00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:46,450
compromised

00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:47,980
so there's no way to on a per address

00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:49,900
basis no way to do like a revocation

00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:51,850
list we're trying to manage that by

00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:53,050
issuing rather short duration

00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:55,420
certificates and letting those just

00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:57,250
expire and require regularly checking in

00:55:55,420 --> 00:56:00,730
with email provider the email provider

00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:02,500
can if they are ever compromised simply

00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:04,780
start publishing a new public key and

00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:07,030
start signing with a new key pair which

00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:09,640
will immediately invalidate all of the

00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:10,960
existing certificates so we have

00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,880
mitigations available for site

00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:16,180
compromises one of the things speaking

00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,290
to the interface real quick is that you

00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:18,970
know right now this is all implement as

00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:21,190
a web form it's fully responsive so if

00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:24,280
you load persona on a phone you get a

00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:25,780
mobile optimized experience whereas you

00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,810
know the desktop looks like that so

00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:32,590
we're really trying to to be as Webbie

00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:33,760
as we can about this yeah sure question

00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:38,260
about if you could move to the mic

00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:41,950
please was a person I like how you would

00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:44,370
implement forgot password scenario and

00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:48,220
which scenario I forgot password

00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:50,680
forgotten password so the way you do it

00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:52,210
with persona is that the user uses their

00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,500
existing email account their existing

00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:55,180
account credentials so it'd be the same

00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,220
way you would handle for getting your

00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:58,660
gmail password or your yahoo password

00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:02,230
because that is the password that you

00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:05,860
have to recover it's not the concern of

00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:11,740
the site anymore at that point you take

00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:14,290
one more question if you have two

00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:16,690
separated Drupal installations and you

00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:18,880
use them usually together it's their way

00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:20,380
that you lock in one installation and

00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,180
you are locked in both into the

00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:24,600
installation and look at out somewhere

00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:27,190
and you look out on both installations

00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:29,170
so the question is is their ability to

00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:31,350
do like cross-domain single sign-on so

00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:33,490
if you run several drupal installations

00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:36,130
can i sign in to want to be signed in to

00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:37,840
all of them not currently we have a

00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:40,570
prototype of a feature that will do just

00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:44,190
that that we hope to push live in the

00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:46,900
next four to six weeks so very very soon

00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:49,330
one of the domains publishes a list that

00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:51,700
says I am part of a realm with all these

00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:54,370
other domains and then each member site

00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,490
also confirms and says I am a member of

00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,960
this realm

00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:59,900
those two things overlap and match up

00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,940
then we synchronize the login state

00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:04,520
across all of them so that is coming

00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:06,710
very soon I think that's all the time we

00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:09,860
have again please please please go in to

00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:11,180
give us feedback and implement input the

00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:13,369
module on your site it's a couple clicks

00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:14,750
we have stickers we're gonna be hanging

00:58:13,369 --> 00:58:39,290
out asking questions asked Jonathan

00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:41,450
questions thank you so much the live

00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:44,240
demo is always a bit of a lottery photos

00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:49,250
okay what a couple of glitches but who's

00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:53,690
