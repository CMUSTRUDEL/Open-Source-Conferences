Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: THE PFIZER STORY: BUILDING A GLOBAL DIGITAL MARKETING PLATFORM WITH DRUPAL
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	Managing an individual site is a complicated business. Managing hundreds of digital marketing sites across 46 countries is...the extreme.

Faced with an already challenging portfolio of sites and dueling mandates to increase time-to-market while reducing cost, Pfizer found a way to keep things simple and cost effective: Drupal.

Join Mike Lamb and Bryan House to learn how Pfizer stopped managing multiple code bases by building a digital marketing platform for hundreds of sites on Drupal running on Acquia Cloud. The session will consist of a presentation from Mike on how Pfizer uses Drupal at the core of its Digital Marketing platform and an fireside chat-style Q&A with Mike and Bryan about their experience.

distinct pleasure to have Mike lamb from

00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,370

00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,839
platform and so mike is going to come in

00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:41,260
here and share a little bit of a pfizer

00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:42,969
story about how they use Drupal to build

00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:46,120
a digital marketing platform to power

00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:47,260
all of their consumer brands and so I've

00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,800
been working with Mike for the last few

00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,149
years as long as a large team at aqua to

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,609
help them think about the role the

00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:56,229
Drupal could play advisor how it

00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:57,760
competes versus some of the other

00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:59,469
technologies they had in place and some

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,780
of the other technologies they were

00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:04,269
considering and then why they ultimately

00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,100
you know selected advisor and Mike's got

00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:08,439
some great slides to walk through that

00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,090
process and then how they use it you

00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:12,280
know one of the questions that we get

00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,490
all the time from organizations I just

00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,960
had the conversation this morning is

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,270
help me understand other people's

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,149
successes you know my peers in my

00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,530
industry in my title and that are trying

00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:25,750
to you know meet similar business

00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:28,090
objectives and so an important piece of

00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,009
what we do at aqua ax is to share those

00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,450
case studies sometimes those are aqua

00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:32,530
customers like in case with Pfizer

00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,630
sometimes they're not but I think

00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,310
spreading the word about Drupal there's

00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,079
a lot of great technical pieces of the

00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,840
story but there's also a lot of great

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,250
business successes and also the results

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,380
and sort of where you get from that and

00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,270
so this is you know a big piece of what

00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,549
we do and we love you and have customers

00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,289
like Mike who are willing to do that and

00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:51,939
to share their story so that way you can

00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:53,890
learn and think about how to sell this

00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:55,420
in your clients or inside your own

00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:58,060
organization how to do greater

00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,259
investment in Drupal so what we're going

00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,299
to do is Mike's going to walk through

00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:03,850
some slides we're going to sit down and

00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:05,950
have Q&A so I'm gonna ask a couple

00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,749
questions and then I'd really love for

00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,890
you guys to ask questions and

00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:10,330
participate in here so we've got

00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,340
microphones there's a mic in the middle

00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,950
of the room so I know it's always hard

00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,370
to be the four

00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:18,500
person to ask a question so so we have

00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,510
lots of plants so get over that now so

00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,280
so don't be shy and then once we usually

00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,599
get one or two then the questions start

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,940
to roll so we'll get you guys involved

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,980
as well so certainly be active and

00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,599
listening and think of some good

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,340
questions for Mike so without further

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,340
ado I'm going to introduce Mike lamb

00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,910
thanks guys so it's it's it's really

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,580
exciting to be sharing what we're doing

00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,230
with with drupal advisor but I have to

00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,510
winter with my first slide from my legal

00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,069
department this is the this is the first

00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,450
time rushing publicly sharing and they

00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:51,590
were officially sharing if anything

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,599
about what we're doing with Drupal and

00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,220
as much as that's a that's a very

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,380
exciting time for us it comes with with

00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:01,880
some some conditions so I'll let you

00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:03,049
read that as I won't pass that so pfizer

00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,030
have been using drupal for a while now

00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:07,340
actually so so we started with Drupal's

00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,650
47 and we started with that with a with

00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,209
a few internal sites so a few intranet

00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,940
sites had knowledge sharing sites that

00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:17,209
we sometimes that we built using using

00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:20,180
drupal 47 that really got us very

00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:21,709
excited in in in this technology in this

00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,290
area and we really started closely

00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:26,420
watching the project at that point we we

00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,910
evaluated Drupal 6 a number of times for

00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,950
external facing external facing projects

00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,450
but many of those projects were very

00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,430
large and we were hoping they would turn

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,350
into a global platform I'm off the back

00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,970
of those first projects we didn't we

00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,829
didn't feel like Drupal 6 was quite

00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,319
there yet so we hadn't we hadn't

00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:45,290
selected that but the moment Drupal 7

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,120
came out it really the timing really

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,500
worked very well for us with one of our

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,430
global business units are consumer

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:54,049
health business unit who make advil

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:56,030
anodyne centrum robert us and chapstick

00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:58,040
etc they were doing a global assessment

00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,599
they really wanted to put a put a new

00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,400
content management system in place for

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:05,569
all the consumer facing they seen brands

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,280
so that happened in q1 2011 and Drupal 7

00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:09,410
was selected as a global technology at

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,910
that point so this was the first time we

00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,859
really got we got serious about

00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:15,769
implementing Drupal's was very exciting

00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:17,930
time so I was I was running the project

00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:19,729
to implement Drupal 7 and I was about

00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:22,880
six to eight eight weeks into that

00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:24,100
project and there was a larger larger

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,710
assessment go

00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,450
under way so consumer represents about

00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,430
five or six percent of Pfizer's revenue

00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,170
which which doesn't sound a lot but

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,450
that's a multi-billion dollar company so

00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:36,960
that was a it was a was a large large

00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:39,250
company were then supporting the Drupal

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,410
the second assessment was for the

00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,600
biopharma biopharma business so really

00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,430
like ninety percent of Pfizer's Pfizer's

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,900
revenue the lion share of pfizer were

00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,610
doing an equal assessments a which wich

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,160
content management system should we use

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,470
so with only only six or so weeks

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,450
experience with with Drupal 7 and

00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,340
implementing this within consumer we we

00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:00,340
fought to get Drupal 7 on the list of

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,750
projects to be evaluated and we went

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,920
through the whole evaluation process

00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,350
actually together with a career with

00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,780
with Brian and team and then a year

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,510
later in q1 2012 the very beginning of

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,340
q1 actually we selected Drupal and

00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,380
accurate of the our global platform for

00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:17,470
all of all of commercial advisor so this

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,610
is really every market all of all of our

00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,350
commercial products they're their

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,140
digital offerings would be delivered

00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:25,270
using Drupal now consider that the real

00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,580
real beginning of large-scale Drupal

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,220
advisor so we're only about 18 months in

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,600
so it's really this still is kind of

00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,890
chapter one of our Drupal story and

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,890
we're very excited about what's to come

00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,240
the case for why we wanted to do this

00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,160
was was actually pretty clear i mean the

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,170
requirements from brand teams everyone's

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,390
everyone's very familiar with I mean the

00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:48,550
expectation on on any digital delivery

00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:50,620
organization is continuing to rise we

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,090
have to build sites with more

00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,980
capabilities more features they have to

00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,740
be mobile there's more and more we have

00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:59,680
to build there's no room especially in a

00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,750
regulated industry to even get you just

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,460
can't compromise on quality these more

00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,230
complex properties have to be the

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,090
highest quality possible-- can be a

00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:09,040
wider audience you're you're typically

00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,690
publishing these two especially when

00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,540
were with some of our consumer products

00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,490
have been advertised with competitions

00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,320
and things on social networks on the

00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,850
same time this is a given you've got to

00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,710
deliver all of this we've got to deliver

00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,470
it faster and you've got to deliver a

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,400
cheaper so this was really the case for

00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,890
implementing some of these global

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,690
platforms and implementing a platform

00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,160
this size while about doing all these

00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:33,880
things is certainly challenged

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,220
address the the environment in which we

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,500
operate isn't isn't simple so the most

00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,600
basic level I consider consider pfizer

00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,970
has to be our region's made up of our

00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,500
individual markets and then our business

00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,110
units with with our individual products

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,880
and then at the intersection of each one

00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,580
of these we typically have a demanding

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,430
brand team who who's java is to promote

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,540
a particular product in their market and

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,610
at the intersection you can actually

00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,110
have many dozens of web properties you

00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,490
know what we we market to healthcare

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,380
professionals to patients we have

00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,850
disease awareness sites we have sites

00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,140
with medical content we have precise of

00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:07,690
promotional content that have to be

00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,250
separated you have sites for for events

00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,160
you have many many different properties

00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,750
in each and each one of these is

00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,920
intersections they're also lots of

00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,870
integrations with third-parties

00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,190
accessions needs to happen is even in

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,950
one of these boxes it can be very very

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,990
challenging and the default behavior is

00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,730
too for that Branton to go and engage a

00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,230
company and implement a snowflake

00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,580
solution i call it any in each one of

00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,290
those in each one of those markets

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,390
you'll have a little pockets of

00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,950
consistency if you're lucky but really

00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:36,130
there's snowflake solutions on the

00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:38,200
market by market basis there's there is

00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,580
some merit to this solution it's you

00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,460
know it's horrific expensive of course

00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,050
in this is not at all efficient but

00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,730
those requirements are talking about in

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,890
terms of quality in your integrations

00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:50,620
etc they're not simple requirements

00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:53,470
differently so you do get to market with

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,240
with the individual brands timeline with

00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,919
their individual requirements but

00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,240
everybody here knows this this isn't

00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:01,270
gonna this isn't going to make sense on

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,550
a large scale and this is this is still

00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,770
the simple version of the picture that's

00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,990
a 50 by 50 grid of these intersections

00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,900
and then 18 months of pfizer we've

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:14,050
already implemented to implement to

00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:16,540
Drupal in 46 markets across 86 sorry 84

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,610
different products so that's 18 months

00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:21,250
in and there are lots of boxes they're

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,870
still to be filled and it's a very very

00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,380
big grid it can be very complicated very

00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,190
quickly

00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,170
so if you want to build a global

00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,600
platform a single global platform on a

00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:32,910
call set of technologies to meet this

00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,350
requirement it has to be very very

00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,820
flexible you have to understand what

00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:38,490
needs to happen in each one of these and

00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,950
the platform has to be very flexible so

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,780
we know we select a Drupal but very

00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,460
quickly how we got to got to selecting

00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,140
Drupal I mean I don't think I require

00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,210
our process was too different to what

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,240
I've seen in other organizations but

00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:52,140
really what it boiled down to was

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,980
evaluating the different technologies

00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,580
with our critical use cases

00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,680
understanding what the differentiators

00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,420
were between these technologies and in a

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,650
lot of time there were proprietary

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,270
solutions that we were compared to work

00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,010
with source so really understanding

00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,380
those two environments and how they work

00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:10,140
and then coming down for list of pros

00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,340
and cons like we we really need to

00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,230
understand if you were to implement

00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,030
solution X versus solution Y and pfizer

00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,940
what are the real pros and cons between

00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:20,280
deceitful for implementing these so I

00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,840
said it's about 60 head we were spat six

00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,120
or eight weeks ahead with that previous

00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,590
selection so the by the time we we got

00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,720
through this this evaluation we were

00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,740
learning more and more about Drupal so

00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,260
as much as we came out the evaluation

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,520
selecting drove or just great we came

00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,220
out of that selection really knowing

00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:38,370
what what we had to tackle to implement

00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,590
Drupal in the global scale at pfizer so

00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,000
we found three or we listed three key

00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,040
challenges that we wanted to address as

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,450
part of our implementation and for each

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,820
one of these challenges our objective

00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:50,400
was to put in the short term solution so

00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,320
this was this was a solution that the

00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,970
pfizer would invest in a point solution

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,580
us putting our finger in the dam to say

00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,770
we are going to fix this we gonna we're

00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,450
going to solve this challenge so we can

00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,740
continue with our global implementation

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,260
and then we're going to put in a

00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,460
long-term solution or typically that

00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,900
long-term solution is a greater

00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,650
investment what we wanted we working

00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:12,810
with groups like LSD or the community to

00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,860
to plan for a long-term solution for

00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,980
implementing these kind of technologies

00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,450
of Pfizer so the first challenge was

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,610
enterprise deployment I mean this isn't

00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,690
a new topic for for many people but it

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:26,440
was a it was a real challenge for us

00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:28,720
and when it the key challenge around

00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,060
this this advisor was it's a regulated

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,620
industry and the thought of editing on

00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,940
production or editing content on

00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,250
production it's just it's just a

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,810
non-starter your your content will not

00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,760
go near a production environment until

00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:43,120
it's absolutely perfect and ready to be

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,680
published so we had to put in a

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,960
short-term solution or an immediate

00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,460
solution to solve for this so we put in

00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,170
a continuous integration environment

00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,210
based on Jenkins for Mary various

00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,650
reasons but then we put in some scripts

00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,500
to move an application from stage into

00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:58,720
production to to allow for this this

00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,280
process we also put some guidelines so

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,690
our various vendor partners could build

00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,220
applications that would work in this

00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,600
this way and that's what very well I

00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,840
mean this has been a place or at for 18

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,490
months now has been very successful

00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,530
long-term we're investing in in a

00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:14,140
collection of tools called WF tools and

00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:15,460
to handler our entire continuous

00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,600
integration and workflow workflow

00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,520
requirements is actually a pfizer

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,940
session tomorrow to talk more about WF

00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,470
tools and and what that really is and

00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,360
the combination of WF tools was seven

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,950
then ultimately WF tools which were

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,080
really planning and implementing now to

00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,390
complement Drupal 8 we feel that this

00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,790
this challenge just disappears off the

00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,620
radar for Drupal what we're very excited

00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:38,800
about what comes as as these things

00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:40,860
naturally progress the second one was

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,330
there the content editors experience so

00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,040
personally I feel that Drupal gets a bit

00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:46,990
of unfair bad press about the content

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,790
content editors experience lots of

00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,170
people talk about it but we've

00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:53,190
implemented a lot of systems that are a

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:55,630
lot worse lot worse than in this area so

00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,850
the key challenge with content editing

00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,830
pfizer was not just editing the content

00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,960
you know and having inline editing or

00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,670
WYSIWYG editor it was the person who was

00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,260
editing the content ultimately had to

00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,780
run a Jenkins Krypton all together on to

00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,490
production so it wasn't something that a

00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,740
business user was really going to be

00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,540
doing so to start off with me we have a

00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,550
highly trained centralized content entry

00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,550
team so that we can manage this on on

00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,600
many many sites on the large-scale

00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,310
long-term we're very excited about

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,010
sparkles coming with that project and

00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:26,140
spark combined with with WF tools and

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,380
Andrew play again you really feel that

00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,700
this this disappears off off the map

00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,140
content editors will be able to be able

00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,560
to edit their content and then publish

00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,300
in a very complex puff within our very

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,690
complex work flow requirements without

00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:42,880
any real challenges the third and final

00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:45,850
one is around Drupal resourcing so in

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,770
this in our first experience

00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,840
implementing for consumer where again we

00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,100
had to implement hundreds of sites we

00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,570
very quickly realized to implement

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,030
hundreds of hundreds of websites on

00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:57,010
Drupal you don't need hundreds of PHP

00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:59,740
developers you need dozens of Drupal

00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,780
lists and the the model in which large

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,370
organizations typically are sourcing or

00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,530
what typically sourcing the technical

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,550
skills store to work on these kind of

00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,440
projects through large systems

00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,730
integrators didn't immediately Jo jive

00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,590
with Drupal particularly back then with

00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,180
there at the you know the beginning of

00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,440
Drupal 7 I think it's constantly

00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,960
improving but it didn't it didn't quite

00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,460
work at that scale at that time so what

00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,150
we did to start off with we engaged with

00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:23,530
a number of dedicated Drupal shops so we

00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:25,540
who end in sign contracts and started

00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,130
working with a few Drupal shops and a

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,430
lot of a dreadful demand has been met in

00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:32,110
that way longer term I mean the number

00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,060
of sites were deploying or drip was only

00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,940
ever increasing we hope to leverage our

00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:38,710
SAS offering and and I share more about

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,150
that in a bit to help with our our

00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:42,400
demand of the number of sites we have to

00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:44,350
launch but then also interested in

00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,110
engagements with with larger systems

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,580
integrators as more and more large

00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:51,280
companies are investing more and more in

00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,170
Drupal really getting Drupal on the list

00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,520
of their key technologies as we know

00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,660
that these large companies have a lot of

00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,130
influence when it comes to getting

00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,150
getting people trained out from these

00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,350
technologies so there's there's

00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:02,920
certainly some potential for the long

00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:06,100
term there as well when it came to the

00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,240
advantage of implement in Drupal it was

00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,220
really interesting because anybody who

00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,840
really got to know Drupal or it had to

00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,030
tell the time of the Drupal comp or

00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,130
anybody technical they were very very

00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:17,680
passionate about Drupal so in these

00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:19,180
sessions they really they they wanted it

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,250
to they wanted it to win they wanted to

00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,140
implement this technology but sometimes

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:25,000
articulating that against a very big

00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:27,100
proprietary solution with a list of a

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,280
thousand features is is a bit more

00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,450
difficult so this was my intent my

00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,370
attempt internally that I'll share with

00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,780
your powers trying to compare this to

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,090
some of our previous implementations

00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:39,460
which are almost exclusively proprietary

00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,840
tools so we have lots of different

00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,490
projects of course with lots of

00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,800
different sizes of complexity some of

00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:47,399
these projects are very very

00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,200
and the typical model that we found us

00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,240
to go buy a big proprietary solution

00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,970
this is the this is the proprietary

00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,160
solution in license that has thousand

00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:58,560
features everything that you ask does

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,750
this solution do this absolutely the

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,480
answer is yes so we come and implement

00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:05,430
this solution excuse me and it does

00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,040
everything but it doesn't really do

00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,870
quite what we needed it to do in my

00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,550
analogous is that there's a square peg

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,350
and around healthy then will pair with

00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,399
me as I take you through this so the

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,019
typical model is we get this big

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,670
proprietary a solution and then we

00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:19,290
customize it we work with one of our

00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:21,300
systems integrators we customize it

00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,700
which takes some time and cost us some

00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,320
money and we get a little bit closer but

00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,000
we do this over and over and over again

00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,839
to the point that we end up with

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,399
something that did it look like the

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,079
original project the product will be

00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,310
bought doesn't look like what we want to

00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:34,500
implement but we actually wanted to

00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,690
implement it's over-engineered in some

00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,870
cases and then mrs. key requirements and

00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:41,640
this is a especially a very common

00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,769
pattern that I've seen in the past we've

00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,660
implemented proprietary tools in this

00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:46,529
space and that circle changes shape as

00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,410
well as you're implementing these

00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:51,930
projects and get get quite challenging

00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:53,640
so we get to this point and we go speak

00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:55,620
to the person that you know sort of sort

00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,660
of this toilet doesn't quite work and

00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,660
they have a new version of this that

00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,160
does a thousand at 1100 things at this

00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,899
point that didn't look like the original

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,820
talk but we're still stranded on our

00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:08,839
Island we can't we can't get to this we

00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:12,779
can't get to this new new upgrade and

00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:13,920
you see this pattern and I've seen

00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:15,510
platforms that have been implemented

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,310
using this pattern and they don't they

00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,410
don't go past a dozen implementations

00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,820
you can't you can't scale this pass a

00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,829
dozen implementations before you run out

00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,540
before you run out of money so you see

00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:26,130
pretty quickly it's not going to work

00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,250
and you don't end up with with happy

00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:31,320
having business users so the better way

00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,930
I consider really is what we're doing

00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,910
with Drupal is we have the very

00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,100
lightweight Drupal core and we put

00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:40,260
course Drupal core is of course across

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,910
every single one of our size unaltered

00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,100
we're not hacking core we're not

00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:46,680
touching this consistent across every

00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,720
single one of our sights on top of that

00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,640
we add in the pfizer platforms this is

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,339
the pfizer platform of installation

00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,230
profiles you know standard modules that

00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,649
we want to implement across every single

00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,529
one of us

00:16:55,649 --> 00:17:00,360
sighs and it's again consistent unhacked

00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:03,720
across every single one of our sites

00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,569
that really helps us to put that base of

00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,760
this platform in place then on top of

00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:12,209
that you have the magic contribution of

00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,439
contraband custom so between your own

00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:14,760
special source for each one of these

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,010
sites if you like and through this

00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,439
combination we can meet any of these

00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:20,699
requirements actually the size of the

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,949
box if you actually looked at contract

00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:24,480
is huge but the magic is you really are

00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:27,299
any picking those individual pieces and

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,850
you're in a good shape to be able to to

00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:31,289
implement so this is this is kind of my

00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,730
internal Drupal story of course you

00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:35,220
you're all very familiar with with

00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,600
Drupal but this is this is how I was

00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,039
trying to articulate internally why I

00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,809
felt this was so different and we were

00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:41,460
so passionate about this versus

00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:45,480
proprietary tools that we do implemented

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:47,340
before so talking a bit about our

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,470
implementation specifically I say were

00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:52,080
really 18 months in and we developed

00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:54,480
hundreds of websites or said differently

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,640
were hundreds of business days in and we

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,260
developed hundreds of websites that can

00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,610
be very challenging if you want if you

00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,010
are really launching multiple websites

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:05,340
per week then it can be very disruptive

00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:07,350
and we spoke about their the beginning

00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,820
about encryption of getting to market as

00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:10,860
fast as you possibly can and reducing

00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,390
costs so we're not here in a position

00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,039
here where this solution is so magical

00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,690
that you can build massive team to go

00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:21,690
and implement this into be very very

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:24,659
efficient than what are you doing excuse

00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:26,039
me so at pfizer we have a massive

00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:27,330
massive scale of different different

00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:29,250
types of sites if you plan to deploy or

00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,809
we are deploying from that one page

00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,059
event site that's like a map of the

00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:34,980
event in the timing for the event all

00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:38,760
the way up to a multilingual portal that

00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:40,409
is deployed across many markets it's

00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,090
actually almost a thousand x difference

00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:44,429
in terms of the size of these these

00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:46,440
projects and we have everything across

00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:47,909
the scale as well and we've implemented

00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,120
multiple of every single one of these

00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:53,370
and when implementing in planning to

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,929
implement Drupal it was it was almost

00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,860
astounding to start off with the fact

00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:57,360
that we really felt that we had a

00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,570
platform like a deploy for every single

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,220
one of these patterns that was

00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,110
impressive in it in itself but we

00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,240
realized that the model to deploy the

00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,470
largest site probably wouldn't be the

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,120
most efficient model for

00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,260
two for deploying the smallest size we

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,500
have to we had to figure something out

00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:16,110
there so again this is this is how

00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,179
sharing this internally but to a brand

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:20,190
manager building a website in one of

00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:21,840
those one of those little snowflakes

00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,549
there's a lot of things they've got to

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,919
go and buy in order to deploy their

00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:28,830
their particular site that side to their

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,360
market and in this one-off scenario they

00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,640
have to have to stretch their budget

00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,900
across this entire this entire spectrum

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,409
they've got to hit every single in these

00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:39,090
boxes some degree they of course want to

00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,559
shift their investment as far up the

00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,030
scale as it possibly can they want to be

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,679
be developing things that really

00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,510
differentiate pfizer don't have

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,400
delivering great content & great

00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:49,230
promotion a great strategy around there

00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,840
they don't want to be talking about load

00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:53,669
balances and databases but in this in

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,650
this one of scenario you really are in a

00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:57,570
bit of a catch-22 situations if you

00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:59,610
don't balance this out and you end up

00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,020
spending all your money on promotion no

00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,250
money on having your load balanced

00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,200
environment or something that can scale

00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,960
your campaign is not going to be

00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,419
successful so the idea with the Drupal

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,280
platform is we have two flavors of this

00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:13,350
platform we have what we call internally

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,440
our custom platform or a past platform

00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,789
where we as as the core team we we

00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,799
define the infrastructure that you have

00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:21,270
we make sure that meets a global

00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:23,340
requirements set which isn't isn't

00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:25,260
simple but we make sure that that that

00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,809
does meet meet a global requirements set

00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:31,049
the platform again of terms unquiet

00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:32,429
quite what we're implementing but the

00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:33,720
core and the platform is again

00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:35,610
consistent across every single one of

00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,600
our sites and then when it comes to the

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,940
features that have been implemented

00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,530
there's a library you can choose from so

00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,970
you can go and go and course pick

00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,140
something from contract or you can pick

00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:46,370
something that pfizer previously

00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:49,620
developed and then then implement that

00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:51,450
this model pushes your investment far up

00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:54,659
further up the scale is far more

00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:57,120
efficient and it has almost unlimited

00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:58,440
flexibility this we've developed lots of

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,929
different types of sites on this

00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,140
platform and it really does have them

00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:06,179
with someone with unlimited flexibility

00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:08,190
but not every site needs unlimited

00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:10,530
flexibility that first sight there was

00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:13,049
just a branded site with a map of the

00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,880
event and some some steps of complexity

00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:16,790
on further

00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:20,690
didn't need unlimited complexes oh sorry

00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:22,220
I'm limited flexibility so we we have a

00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:25,310
second platform we put in place our SAS

00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:27,050
platform which is the gardens where the

00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:29,000
the core the core platform underneath

00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:31,280
this is identical you know same versions

00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,570
of Drupal core the same pfizer standard

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,850
modules were deploying to every single

00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:36,290
one of these sites but on top of that we

00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,610
lock down the features that are

00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,950
available to each one of these these

00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:41,840
marketing teams when you're deploying

00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:44,750
hundreds of sites you very quickly

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,190
recognize a loss a lot of consistency

00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,290
between them you see key features that

00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:50,000
are many many of these sites and if you

00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:51,530
can pick those out and get as many of

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,310
those into your course asked platform as

00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:57,170
you can do then if this this this method

00:21:55,310 --> 00:22:02,680
of creating the many many of these sites

00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:04,910
becomes becomes such more more easier so

00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,650
this really pushed the investment all

00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:08,060
the way up the scale so the pattern we

00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:10,370
see here when a brand manager wants to

00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,870
deploy a site is rather than coming in

00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:14,030
and starting with the basic bartok site

00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:15,680
and building up from there they come in

00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,940
and they see a site that's been talked

00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,860
they've been deployed already to another

00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,110
market it really meets their needs they

00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,370
take that site they take the content

00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,870
they adapt it for their market they

00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:26,330
localize it for their compter for them

00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:28,280
to their market and they deploy it and

00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,260
if you can get into a model where you

00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,690
have enough enough of your core features

00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,070
in this kind of platform the many of

00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:37,520
your site's going to be deployed in that

00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:39,170
in that way then launching multiple

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,030
sites / weeks guess how it gets a lot

00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,350
easier if the core will the technical

00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:45,620
build of the project that comes in on

00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:46,700
Tuesday can be done by Friday then just

00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,890
the following projects that you're

00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:52,400
bringing in can get a get a lot easier

00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:53,830
can be it can be can be scalable without

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,590
having thousands of people behind this

00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,850
so in terms of we talked about this this

00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,570
the standard expectations around

00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:01,570
capability

00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,200
so one installation our Drupal know so

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,370
this these are all separate sites but

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,500
they're on one instance of Drupal it's

00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:26,750
using its using cloud site patria Acquia

00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,610
cloud side battery so it's one

00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,690
installation one code base of Drupal so

00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,160
our features are consistent across

00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,720
Christmas consistent across these

00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:46,160
hundreds of sites but they are

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:47,150
individual sites so the key reason for

00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,550
that is if I find when we're

00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,980
implementing implementing particular

00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:53,210
site in multiple markets it's easy to

00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,860
think that the process of taking this

00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:57,830
one campaign to multiple sizes just

00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,970
translation but localizing content for

00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,740
multiple sites with different

00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,260
regulations regulations different

00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:06,770
different environments can be very

00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:08,900
challenging so we we find by having

00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,760
multiple sites it strikes the right

00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,890
balance for for our industry to have

00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,300
consistency but at the same time have

00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,210
flexibility for each one of the

00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:19,480
marketing teams and that there are there

00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:20,930
you know diff very different regulatory

00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,790
environments in each one of these

00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:24,650
markets were deploying to so it's it's

00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:26,510
often more complicated in the Tran you

00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,740
know translating content or showing

00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:33,860
slightly different things on a domain

00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:36,050
access model right so when we said in

00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,030
the core platform what you're expected

00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,740
to do responsive design integration with

00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:42,950
with various other systems as standard

00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:45,260
it's there it's expected but we've got

00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:47,870
to get into a situation where we we get

00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:50,060
to market ever much faster and the cost

00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:52,820
for doing this is reduced so clearly

00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:55,400
this is this picture works in this way

00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:57,440
the one-off model is very expensive and

00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,910
it takes a very long time that's almost

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,130
like the proprietary model the first

00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:03,740
time around but then the past model is

00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:06,290
ever so much faster and cheaper and this

00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,660
this met a lot of this was this was a

00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,770
lot of expectations internally until you

00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,650
get the point where you really need to

00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:14,450
scale when you really need to scale you

00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:16,490
get into a situation very easily or

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,690
using this this strategy where you can

00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:21,019
deliver site someday

00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:26,360
you know in days in our kind of industry

00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:27,740
and deliver the motor so much cheaper so

00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,899
just in key lessons we've learnt as

00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,340
we've we've worked along work through

00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:34,159
this over the last 18 months must say

00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,809
it's still early days but focus on the

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,360
right things when you are getting

00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:41,090
multiple requests in per week you've got

00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,690
to be focusing on the right ones so so

00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:47,120
partner partner for the commodities so

00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:49,820
at this scale we're not really in the

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,559
luxury of saying all hoping the things

00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,570
aren't and a break at some point it's

00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:54,889
more being smart about figuring what's

00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,779
going to what about what's going to

00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:59,029
break next and making sure there is a

00:25:56,779 --> 00:26:01,129
team that's capable of fixing that ready

00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:03,139
at the side to go and go and take care

00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:04,519
of that one it ultimately happens so if

00:26:03,139 --> 00:26:05,629
you can take large parts of your

00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:07,100
infrastructure and that someone else

00:26:05,629 --> 00:26:08,870
deal with that for you then you're going

00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,360
to be in a much better situation so as

00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:13,370
much of those lower components we we

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,379
have we have we have partners to deal

00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,700
with that for us take those

00:26:15,379 --> 00:26:18,590
software-as-a-service approach from as

00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:22,519
many of the sites as possible this is a

00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:23,899
an internal learning anyway but every

00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:25,639
site thinks that they are other own

00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:27,470
special snowflakes from the beginning

00:26:25,639 --> 00:26:29,389
they think they have some custom

00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:31,850
requirement that's very special for them

00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:32,929
but in reality as long as you get into a

00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,940
situation where you can offer

00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:37,309
flexibility if it comes to or if it's

00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:40,460
absolutely necessary and you have an

00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:42,860
alternative of I can deploy what you

00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,179
really need and I can deploy very very

00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,679
cost effectively in the number of days

00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:47,299
and the remainder of your budget can we

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,649
spent on promotion then you can have

00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:50,179
some realistic conversations about what

00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:53,029
is really going to drive effectiveness

00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:54,529
of this of this campaign talking more

00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:57,259
taking like the domain access model

00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:59,690
model piece this is a big big learning

00:26:57,259 --> 00:27:00,830
from them from the beginning it's one

00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:04,370
line but it can be talked about for

00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:05,539
hours on end but i really like

00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,250
implementing the model of having

00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:09,049
application independence by default and

00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,240
then layering layering in the

00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:13,879
consistency that's necessary so for

00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,169
example on the SAS platform a consistent

00:27:13,879 --> 00:27:16,909
single installation a drupal makes

00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:20,090
absolute sense that's that's that's very

00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:21,980
easy but on the custom platform you can

00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:24,289
very quickly get into scenarios where

00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,899
you deploy one capability to as we have

00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:30,310
done to like 40 plus markets and then

00:27:26,899 --> 00:27:32,320
market number 10 needs needs an enhanced

00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:33,520
and sometimes these enhancements in

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,560
Drupal can be complicated sometimes

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,060
we've had enhancements that need new

00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:39,670
modules that need latest versions of PHP

00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:41,200
and if we get into a situation where in

00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:43,060
order to get that market to meet its

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,610
objective I need to go and either engage

00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:48,160
with or regression test another 50

00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:50,500
markets then I'm not in a knot in a very

00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,420
flexible situation so application

00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,740
independence independence by default and

00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:57,610
then choose your level of consistency

00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:58,930
you want to layer on top of that build a

00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,850
team of Drupal rockstars if you have the

00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:02,410
luxury of doing this absolutely do this

00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:04,900
especially if you're you're operating at

00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:06,820
scale so there are there are 10 ways to

00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,350
do anything in Drupal of course you're

00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,030
going to do that anything multiple time

00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,140
so pick the right way to do it and pick

00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:13,150
it all the right way for you to do it

00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:15,910
and do it consistency consistently in

00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,900
that way some projects especially if

00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:19,510
you're working with lots of different

00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:22,060
vendors won't go as perfectly as you

00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:23,560
might hope so be there to rescue those

00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:26,950
be there to guide them and they get into

00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:28,450
trouble to help them out develop a

00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:30,550
platform so the platform we mentioned

00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:32,290
have a team there to develop that have a

00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:33,850
team to understand what it means to make

00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:35,590
a change there's going to be deployed

00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:39,340
across many many sites and ensure that

00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:41,350
appropriate level of consistency finally

00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,060
implement your your core functionality

00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:45,310
and strategy and we kind of consider

00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:47,650
that our internal internal Drupal team

00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:49,240
they're the creators of our continuous

00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,670
integration environment our deployment

00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,410
environment etc also our champions for

00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:55,720
things like BDD so as you want to push

00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:57,580
this platform forward build like

00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,620
behavioral driven development these are

00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:02,020
the guys that are leading to say this is

00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:03,760
the benefit to implement this this on

00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,260
this scale and can help us for

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,120
guidelines etc in place for how we

00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:10,180
actually get that implemented with with

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,160
our with our vendor partners finally

00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:14,800
security of course it's a given that you

00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,600
have to be there's no compromise around

00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,950
security here and if you have a core

00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,350
team that's constantly watching your

00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:21,910
back or understanding what what issues

00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:23,770
could be faced or what issues you could

00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:28,480
come up with here then you're going to

00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:29,650
be in a better situation so other than

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,360
that the questions which were doing a

00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:33,070
moment just the plug for our session

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,120
that we're doing tomorrow so some of the

00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:36,460
fires the guys at the back of the room

00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,860
tomorrow presenting on WF tools a far

00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,120
more technical session on the the tools

00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,100
that are implementing to manage our

00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,500
workflow and viral

00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:59,539
for drupal 7 and then Drupal 8 and

00:29:43,500 --> 00:30:03,059
beyond that's sit for my slides so

00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:04,650
thanks Mike that was fantastic so at

00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:06,270
this point what we'll do is we'll I'm

00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:08,490
gonna have a couple questions that I'm

00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:10,140
gonna ask and then I encourage you as I

00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:11,760
mentioned before to think about the

00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,559
questions that you want to ask Mike and

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,690
sort of how we can get the most out of

00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:17,159
this session given that you do have

00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:23,370
access to him here so certainly take

00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:25,110
advantage of it so so my first questions

00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:28,110
I had was you know you mentioned that

00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:30,090
you guys are looking at Drupal early

00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:33,539
days and six and then seven came out but

00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:37,470
what you found was both consumer pharma

00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:39,360
and the biopharma we're doing CMS

00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:41,370
selection processes and sort of in

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,770
parallel so what triggered the

00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:45,630
organization to start the CMS selection

00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:48,090
processes that ultimately resulted in

00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:50,490
the selection of Drupal shall so so

00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:54,059
really it was it started off from the

00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:55,710
capability side so we had a lot of these

00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:57,600
snowflakes solutions and a lot of lot of

00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:59,669
cases bran teams were meeting their

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,539
objectives through through through their

00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:03,419
own agencies and their own

00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:06,059
implementations but there were some some

00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:08,400
limited platforms in place and we we

00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:11,280
quickly got to a point where some of

00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:13,380
these like what we originally considered

00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,730
edge cases like you know five years ago

00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:17,400
building a site to work on a mobile

00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:19,409
phone we didn't need to build platforms

00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,990
to do that became absolutely mandatory

00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:23,700
and as soon as those as soon as those

00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:26,820
pockets of consistency couldn't deliver

00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,960
on that then it opened kind of a can of

00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,520
worms of a lot of other things that

00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,860
those common platforms couldn't couldn't

00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,140
deliver and that led to the case of led

00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:35,730
to the case of were we're implementing

00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,610
things I'm far more complex we need to

00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:40,950
take a better platform approach to this

00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:42,320
interesting I know you know one of the

00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:45,330
things you talked a lot about at the end

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,830
was your ability now you've got in this

00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,780
place where you guys can deliver sites

00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:50,190
and date

00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,510
and I know a few years ago I think back

00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,460
to the conversations we had we talked a

00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:55,410
lot about how long it took to develop

00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:58,410
sites and some of the existing systems

00:31:55,410 --> 00:32:00,480
you had give us a little bit of a flavor

00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:02,010
of how big a change this has been at

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,850
Pfizer sort of what it took to build a

00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:07,770
website the old way yeah it's it's a

00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:09,540
massive it's a massive massive change so

00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:10,740
there's there's a lot of benefits that

00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,360
come out if I talk about the SAS

00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,460
approach so that's one extreme so that's

00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,500
the extreme where you can you can really

00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,120
have a website coming on Tuesday and if

00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,130
if they're it can you can absolutely be

00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,050
built on front by Friday and in many

00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:24,840
cases it can be approved and ready to

00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:26,190
launch by friday as well there's a lot

00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,170
that needed to happen in that SAS

00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:30,030
platform to make it make it necessary I

00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:32,190
mean there's so much consistency

00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:33,840
consistency on that platform that we are

00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:36,120
security testing this for example dat a

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,740
platform level so our security testing

00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,780
process that takes multiple weeks with

00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,820
multiple months of lead time happens on

00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:44,370
a platform level so if you're building

00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:46,110
this is a one off one by one site by

00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:48,270
default you have a multi multi month

00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:50,280
process to start off with we don't

00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:52,650
compromise on security so it means that

00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,630
even if even if that site came in on the

00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:58,470
Tuesday and put is requesting on the

00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:59,670
Tuesday to to be security tested even in

00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:01,260
the best case and that was our highest

00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:02,820
priority site provides it to launch

00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,530
still gonna be a couple of weeks before

00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,179
it can be out the door by default no

00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:07,770
matter how fast you can you can build it

00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:10,730
and there are a lot of processes around

00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:13,470
this that we've managed to optimize or

00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:15,929
already perfect for SAS type deployment

00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:23,640
using using using this kind of this kind

00:33:15,929 --> 00:33:26,250
of structure so you know a lot of what

00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,320
you do i believe is on the IT answer the

00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,910
technical side and your customer within

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,120
Pfizer's the business though product

00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:34,830
managers in market what's their

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,300
awareness of Drupal do they know they're

00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:37,860
using Drupal I mean how what's your

00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,650
interaction with them from a technology

00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:42,840
perspective I didn't have this question

00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:44,730
but i do have just to give you I didn't

00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,929
know this question in advance but just

00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,250
to give you a nice talking about the

00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:49,950
gesture to give someone an idea of the

00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:51,630
awareness of this in within visor I was

00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:54,840
with one of my colleagues when we were

00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:56,700
when we're introducing Drupal to to a

00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,820
marketing team this was this was at the

00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,940
very beginning

00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:02,650
and we were introducing that Drupal to

00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,940
their marketing team and talking about a

00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:07,210
lot of the advantages of why we wanted

00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:08,260
to build this in Drupal and that we got

00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,760
to the end of the conversation they were

00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:13,240
convinced why we wanted to do this in

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,740
Drupal but their response then came to

00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:17,620
why am i building in Drupal but not in

00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:19,000
bangalore you guys came to us you guys

00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,380
came to us a few months ago and have

00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
this great outsourcing opportunity

00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:23,620
you're building sites in bangalore

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,570
cheaper than you'd ever ever done it

00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:28,540
before so there's certainly been a

00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:30,310
learning curve we started off with just

00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:31,450
the requirements coming from the

00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:33,400
business and having to meet those

00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:34,600
requirements so I'd say a lot of the

00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,820
success of this platform is just been

00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,260
building credibility understanding and

00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,060
pushing the boundaries of what the brand

00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:44,610
teams want to do and then delivering on

00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:46,660
that very very consistently interesting

00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:48,430
so you know you talked a lot about

00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:52,180
platforms and obviously platform is a

00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:54,040
really important piece of your story you

00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:57,490
know you mentioned you have pass and

00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:59,590
sass and you work with aqua as you think

00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:01,120
back to the selection process the fact

00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:03,400
that you had the flexibility in your

00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,080
deployment models and sort of these how

00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,730
important a role did that play in your

00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,990
selection ultimately Drupal as compared

00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:10,270
to the other technologies you were

00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:12,280
looking at there there wasn't another

00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:14,560
technology that we were selecting that

00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,380
could deliver that full scale of the

00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,230
smaller size larger size when we knew in

00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:21,790
that selection that we we needed to

00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,900
tackle that full spectrum and we knew

00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:25,090
that that was going to be a critical

00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,950
critical to our success but the

00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:29,200
competitor to Drupal in that space was

00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:31,150
implementing multiple technologies so

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,430
this was a major win for Drupal in the

00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:35,290
fact that we could choose one technology

00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:36,730
and it still astounds me the fact that

00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:38,140
we really have picked one technology

00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:40,780
when you see the complexity on one end

00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:44,050
versus the the micro sites that have

00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:45,670
built on the other end and it was it was

00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:49,000
only Drupal they can deliver that but

00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:50,860
further than that it was only really

00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,380
made Drupal Drupal win from another

00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:55,780
benefit that we could actually invest in

00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,830
those and those sass components so the

00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,810
common features that are going to be

00:35:56,830 --> 00:36:00,460
deployed across the rest of our sites by

00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:01,540
not splitting this across two different

00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,380
technologies and having to implement

00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:05,080
every single one of those

00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:07,400
functionalities twice it really actually

00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:09,710
works we built sites in that sass

00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:12,170
form that were built very fast maybe

00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:13,490
took a opportunity that wouldn't have

00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,529
otherwise been addressed without without

00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:17,359
that platform but then have grown and

00:36:15,529 --> 00:36:18,859
then if required custom functionality

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:21,740
and things that were one off of that

00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:24,020
particular site and using this model

00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:25,760
this magical you can take it take it out

00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:28,099
put it into your past platform and then

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,660
put in whatever layer of integration or

00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:31,789
functionality you might want on top of

00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,869
that as well so it was the only it was

00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,670
the only solution that really offered

00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:36,710
that ya know and that's a you know

00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:38,299
that's this video only product pitchy I

00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:40,099
think that's a big piece of when we

00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:42,529
built our SAS platform aqua cloud site

00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:45,109
factory that freedom and flexibility to

00:36:42,529 --> 00:36:46,700
move between one model right because you

00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:49,039
know I think the hard thing when we're

00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,839
talking to business people is sites are

00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:52,160
not the static thing okay it's launched

00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:54,980
now go to and go on to the next thing it

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,960
becomes this entity that grows and

00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:59,839
evolves and changes and you you know

00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,039
being locked in in some cases is is

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,970
worse then you get to start over again

00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:07,609
I'm gonna ask one more question then

00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:09,619
we'll open it up to the audience what I

00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:10,760
will ask is is maybe if you can come to

00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:12,500
the microphone the session is being

00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,720
recorded and so that talking to the

00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,670
microphone in the room will be will able

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,240
to capture the questions for anyone

00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:22,240
who's listening or listens to this later

00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,869
so a lot of folks in here aren't

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,309
organizations like Pfizer but they're

00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:28,069
actually service providers consulting

00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:30,170
digital agencies so what advice do you

00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:32,240
have for consulting firms for agencies

00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:33,890
in the room in terms of how they should

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,170
think of approach working with a company

00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:38,359
like Pfizer in a large global

00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:40,520
multinational you know fortune 100

00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:42,500
company it's a good question have to

00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,569
think of it a bit about the answer so we

00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,309
we work with what when we're talking

00:37:44,569 --> 00:37:47,960
about that spectrum of different sites

00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:49,430
that were launching the reason we're

00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,980
working with multiple vendor partners is

00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:53,720
we find that there are there each each

00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:56,000
of the vendors have their sweet spot

00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,920
across that spectrum at some point you

00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,119
don't want to take the you want to be

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,829
developing those smaller sites as

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,420
efficiently as possible as fast as you

00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:03,710
possibly can and that's typically a

00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,569
completely different skill set that we

00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:11,299
need at the other end of at the other

00:38:05,569 --> 00:38:12,950
end of the scale what I'd say is is we

00:38:11,299 --> 00:38:15,049
we've got to a situation where were

00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:17,420
we're using that kind of internal team

00:38:15,049 --> 00:38:18,510
and and also with a queer will really

00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,460
understanding the

00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:21,860
quality of our Drupal drupal solutions

00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,450
and we're really getting into a

00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:26,730
situation where we can that quality

00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:29,220
typically maps over to the value of that

00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:31,910
over time I mean reuses a massive

00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:34,350
massive component of this so if you can

00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:37,470
if your organization's don't understand

00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:39,030
or aren't we using components that or

00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:40,860
aren't asking you to build things in

00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:42,920
ways that can be reused help them

00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:45,180
understand that story because it's a

00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,790
something I haven't talked about here

00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:49,170
too much but it's it's a kind of a whole

00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:51,120
another vector for this for how you can

00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:54,050
bring value to these kind of projects so

00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:56,430
not every every Drupal shop we approach

00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:59,040
thinks that way or vendor we approach

00:38:56,430 --> 00:39:01,170
thinks that way so if you do then or if

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,030
you either do it by default or convince

00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:04,230
the organization you're working with why

00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,310
they should build these things then

00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,840
you're going to bring a ton of extra

00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:09,960
body to the project that's great that's

00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:12,330
great so so love to take some questions

00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,030
from the audience so so someone be the

00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:16,410
first one John are you going to do it

00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:19,680
all right thanks it's always the first

00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:22,260
one's always the hardest so you talked

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,560
about how the brand managers have their

00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:27,600
own agencies and now there's you know

00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:31,080
you've got the the SAS on-site factory

00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:32,790
and you've got past as well what's those

00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,140
agencies assume now have to have

00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:36,150
something to do with that they have to

00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,320
be integrated into that process when

00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,490
there's a new theme built for a new

00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,410
product or something like this they're

00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:42,930
building inside factory as well can you

00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:45,600
talk about that process and maybe how

00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:47,280
you got those agencies involved or

00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:50,940
whether that was through that fear or

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,190
who else sure so I'd start by making

00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,420
sure I'm clear about the term agency and

00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,980
what I'm what I'm doing with with the

00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,780
agency so I would separate that from the

00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,770
drupal shops for example so yeah I'm

00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,530
just not going to bucket these two

00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:02,730
together I'd say our agencies and the

00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:04,500
partners were working there with their

00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:05,940
from the creative side particularly the

00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,050
ones that were working with with a kind

00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:10,050
of content we're expecting them to

00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:12,390
produce building these sites is not in

00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:14,400
their core in their court case I believe

00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:16,560
you work with wpp in a couple of other

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,110
work with a lot longer a lot of agencies

00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,850
and not Drupal's not their thing right

00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:22,230
the trip was not their thing and if they

00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,700
do implement it they are typically

00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,840
outsourced to a partner something I'm

00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,140
some of the partners we're using for

00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,610
drupal develop

00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:30,470
but it's not really there it's not

00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:31,730
really this their thing and because you

00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,200
work with a lot of different agencies in

00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,580
a lot of different markets their

00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,740
consistency has to really come from

00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:38,420
Pfizer and you have to get into a model

00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:41,420
where you change your relationship with

00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:44,780
with with those those agencies do it to

00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:46,160
a degree and you have the right

00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:48,530
selection for the right vendor for the

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,970
build and you have an appropriate not

00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,200
necessarily fully centralized but you

00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:52,310
have the appropriate model in place to

00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,530
be able to marry these things together

00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:55,790
so that you have the agency focused on

00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:57,770
what they're doing which is typically in

00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:00,100
that top like Dolan category and then

00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:02,210
you have a team that can can effectively

00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:05,210
understand that to be able to implement

00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:06,680
that in a case of technologies to end up

00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,650
technology implementation besides that

00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,820
so you're marrying you know the

00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:12,920
marketing agency is doing you know the

00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:14,420
the PST s or the first design with a

00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,340
Drupal agency who does the theme that

00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,050
kind of thing and then yeah and we

00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,790
manage that and we put in build kits and

00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:24,590
guidelines to help help manage that

00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:27,410
transition between them thanks John yes

00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:31,280
it's good to microphone good you guys

00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:33,980
come from a line when i'm closer okay um

00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,320
I have a question I can imagine that on

00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,560
your local mark is there some people who

00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:41,180
are reluctant to a standardized solution

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,620
we think that today we're far ahead of

00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:46,100
the crowd and it might even be further

00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:47,570
ahead of what you're providing now do

00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:50,180
you have any best practices and I how

00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:51,710
getting these people on board so if

00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:53,690
they're further ahead let them be

00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:56,060
further ahead I mean we're not we're not

00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:59,000
trying to we're not trying to solve for

00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:00,590
every single possible use case and we we

00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,420
listen very closely to our individual

00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:03,260
markets to help understand common trends

00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:06,620
of things that might want to be

00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:08,660
implemented but this implementing this

00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:10,880
platform has been says one hundred

00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:12,950
percent carrot and zero percent stick we

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,840
try and help out with with implementing

00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:17,060
these these services and that's been

00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:18,290
very very successful if it turns out

00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,090
that a marketing campaign in an

00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:21,530
individual market considering all the

00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:23,270
extra process they have to go through to

00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:25,220
launch their site can still be more

00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:26,540
effective I don't believe that happens

00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:29,420
on a large scale but if it really is

00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:32,510
more effective let it run in that let it

00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:33,860
run in that way and so there's a lot of

00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:36,410
what we're doing in terms of proving the

00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:37,360
value internally to this or showing the

00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:39,370
value to

00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:41,760
each of these individual teams but to be

00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:44,560
honest that's that's not largely been

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,700
it's not really largely a challenge that

00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,950
we've had to address with this platform

00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:49,660
I would say I've spent the majority of

00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:51,820
my time with visor on the other side

00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,860
where that has been a much larger

00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:55,660
challenge where there's a typically that

00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:57,670
proprietary implementation and you're

00:42:55,660 --> 00:43:05,590
one of the first and you're fighting

00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:07,750
against it thank you hey I have kind of

00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:09,100
two backgrounds I'm a drupal developer

00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:10,960
but on the other hand I'm also

00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:12,940
pharmacists working with a small

00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:17,380
pharmaceutical company as a product

00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:20,410
manager and so I try to bring drupal

00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:23,310
into our organization on an

00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:27,370
internet-based as a product platform and

00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:30,490
what I think is for always for us the

00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:32,290
biggest challenge is to somehow get our

00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:34,840
approval processes which differ from

00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:38,800
brand to brand from product from market

00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:40,840
to market to get this into Drupal so we

00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,510
often have the situation that we have a

00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:45,760
content creator we have search engine

00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:48,220
optimization team we have the approval

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:52,300
person we have the product manager we

00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:54,550
have many different people who differ

00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:56,530
from project to project and do you

00:43:54,550 --> 00:44:01,960
manage to get all this into your

00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:03,340
workflow tools so an integral so we so

00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,940
when we're talking about our workflow

00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:07,930
within within within Drupal fo for for

00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,060
promoting content you talk to a lot of

00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:11,080
the challenges that we have you you

00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,520
should talking to think about that

00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,900
environment and you think at the other

00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,370
end of the scale directly editing

00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,720
something on production you can see why

00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:17,530
these things aren't going to drive and

00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,050
why these things aren't going to work

00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:22,660
together but on the other hand when

00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:25,150
implementing a platform on the scale we

00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,560
can't we have to have some like common

00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:28,480
integration points to some of these some

00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,980
of these processes so I'd say we've

00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,270
optimized and we've built specific

00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:32,680
features or functionality into our

00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:35,530
platform to support these kind of

00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:37,930
approval processes but in many in many

00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:40,780
type many cases in many markets there

00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:42,460
are offline processes and so we built

00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:44,170
functionality to optimize those as much

00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:46,120
as we possibly can can do especially

00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:47,730
when it gets more complicated around

00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,290
things like responsive design and

00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:51,360
translation and these kind

00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:53,730
things we optimized to integrate with

00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,770
those processes but the objective of the

00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:58,350
digital platform isn't isn't to run

00:44:55,770 --> 00:45:00,240
those processes is to integrate with

00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:02,610
with the existing processes in h2 the

00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,170
market is so the approval process of

00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:06,030
time slots are completely outside of

00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:07,950
Drupal and somebody signs a document

00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:09,870
which is a little legal document for

00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:13,620
example which needs for the registration

00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:16,430
or exactly that so that process happens

00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:18,840
outside and we we make sure that were

00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:20,040
we're putting the workflow within with

00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,810
him in with in Drupal to give you

00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,340
absolute confidence that the thing that

00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:25,380
you're saying yes to publish to the

00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:26,460
production matches the PDF file you've

00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,500
got in front of you and the thing that

00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:30,060
was legally come legally signed off by

00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,220
compliance to be launched but do you

00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,810
still work then with revisions that if

00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:36,270
you have a new content for example that

00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:38,940
the old content is safety in the Drupal

00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:41,820
yatra yep so there's lots of advantages

00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:43,890
to come from that so I am we use those

00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:46,050
tools so we're course we have revisions

00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:47,220
on on on all content on all all content

00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:50,520
types that work we have within our

00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:52,380
sights and that also helps when when

00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,700
that person SAT there with the PDF file

00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,900
from in front of them of this is what

00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,940
was signed off through that legal

00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,950
process then revision things can help

00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:00,540
help with that process by doing like a

00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:02,190
diff between what was there before and

00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:05,040
what's there now and am i comfortable

00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:06,750
that that diff is fully represented in

00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:10,800
this document and can be legally signed

00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:12,930
off to deploy I think there's more that

00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,610
can be done to optimize optimize the

00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:15,900
area particularly as were we're

00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,100
stretching the boundaries of some of the

00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:19,290
additional channels you want to deploy

00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:23,460
to then that's needs to be done done

00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:25,140
done faster but i'd say we built enough

00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,510
into drupal to really optimize that

00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:30,030
process versus versus doing from scratch

00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:35,490
which is very very manual can I have one

00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:37,830
last question so as a drupal developer i

00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:41,070
will also work for political parties and

00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:43,830
also now company i think they also want

00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:46,440
the approval process inside of drupal

00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:48,960
they want this do you have tools inside

00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,550
your workflow tools that you'll get

00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,720
excited by the WF tools sessions

00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:54,060
tomorrow I'm sure

00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,530
come along to that what we've it that

00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:58,320
we've built that well it's been built

00:46:55,530 --> 00:47:00,630
effectively as a framework to manage the

00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:02,580
very very different types of workflow

00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:05,520
needs in each one of our each one of our

00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:07,230
markets and the the requirement we're

00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,359
talking about here is is typically

00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:11,520
medical content or promotional content

00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,660
related to a pharmaceutical product we

00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,920
have a lot of different types of

00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,090
products or different lots of different

00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,950
types of properties at the same time

00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:18,660
there might not be promotional might or

00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:21,090
might not contain medical content in

00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:22,470
which case probably some of the the

00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:24,480
workflow types you might expect for your

00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:27,300
other other sites are more relevant and

00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,070
the idea of the implementation with WF

00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,720
tools is to cover this spectrum oof be

00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:33,960
flexible enough to cover the spectrum in

00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,369
some cases it will be the the method of

00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,490
signing off content to go to production

00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:41,640
fully in case within that system in some

00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:43,080
cases it will be integrated with the the

00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:46,070
other processes to the point that we can

00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:48,570
we can optimize this as much as we can

00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:51,630
doing more pitching your name and you're

00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:55,920
the IT guy as I said I spent most of my

00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:57,810
time outside of ID advisor Mike thank

00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,080
you for your presentation it was really

00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:04,260
interesting specifically the platform

00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:06,619
yeah information Maria's general blink

00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:09,240
reaction I have a couple of questions

00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:11,280
first one is when you work with these

00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:15,260
multiple design agencies do you have any

00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:17,670
guidelines for designing Drupal sites

00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:20,339
the reason why I'm asking is we all know

00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:22,650
that we can implement any kind of design

00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:25,339
in Drupal but if the design is so-called

00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:28,500
like drupal friendly or responsive

00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:34,380
design friendly and adaptive that makes

00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:38,580
a huge difference for the time frame

00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:40,760
right and it's a very good question so i

00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:44,849
would say on a lot of our a lot of our

00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:46,500
more basic sites we don't if something

00:48:44,849 --> 00:48:49,410
comes up and it's clear that it's going

00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:51,000
to take a lot of time at implemented

00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:52,380
this way I'm Drupal versus we really

00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,940
believe that you could implement it this

00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:56,220
way particularly to stick if you're

00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:58,080
building on also on the sass platform

00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:00,000
you know it's going to take us longer to

00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:02,190
build this particular widget in this way

00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,930
whereas blinker building build

00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:06,660
some of those if you if you want to

00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:09,510
build it if you want to build it in a

00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:11,070
drupal way it might be easier so we have

00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:12,240
some discussion around that but I'd say

00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:14,220
that really comes up on some of our

00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,700
larger projects when you maybe maybe

00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:19,530
building a web application on Drupal

00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:22,410
it's it's it's easy to have an agency

00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:25,530
who are building a building the concept

00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:27,450
for a large large application to build

00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:29,820
many many dozens of wireframes coming

00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:32,550
covering the full functionality and we

00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:35,340
even had a project recently where they

00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:37,320
would they were say we go to about a

00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:38,850
dozen wireframes covering functionality

00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,990
that was already delivered by drupal so

00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:42,120
they kind of redesigning or

00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:44,490
re-implementing this and on all of those

00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:46,410
larger projects it's a member of my

00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:48,270
teams that call that core engineering

00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:50,280
team that running this platform that are

00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:51,690
engaged in each one of those projects so

00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,940
we try and catch those things early on

00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:56,850
enough to say you know consulting with

00:49:53,940 --> 00:50:00,510
those projects and and understand you

00:49:56,850 --> 00:50:01,950
know the that that doesn't make sense to

00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:03,540
implement it quite that way with in

00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:05,370
Drupal we can optimize this we can do

00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:08,070
this a lot faster if we do it do it this

00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:09,930
way I say it's my team but it's really

00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:14,010
guys I have from a queer don't open that

00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:15,750
I take the credit for thank you and I

00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:19,680
have a one more question in regards to

00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:22,710
the deployment due to the business

00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:24,570
requirements and approval process you

00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:27,480
mentioned that all content changes are

00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:30,090
done on staging environment and then

00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:32,580
after approval they are deployed to

00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:34,710
production how do you handle websites

00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:39,680
where you have user-generated content

00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:42,200
like five star voting comments

00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:44,550
submissions form submissions another

00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:48,450
it's a good question it's not it's not

00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:49,890
easy and there's the when I said that

00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:51,120
the short term implementation was the

00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:53,310
script to move from stage into

00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,020
production that comes along with some

00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:56,610
guidelines that tells you in a lot of

00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:58,440
technical detail how this process works

00:50:56,610 --> 00:51:00,360
and there are a number of different ways

00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,520
you can preserve specific content on

00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,620
production while while running that

00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,960
stage into production process so I would

00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:09,120
say it's very far from perfect and it's

00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:12,420
a it's a good it's a good use case

00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:15,390
that's absolutely covered using using

00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:17,069
the WF implementation however a lot of

00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:18,839
a lot of the sites that we have

00:51:17,069 --> 00:51:21,210
user-generated content on production

00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:24,329
it's typically things like five star

00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:26,339
voting or some comments or the more

00:51:24,329 --> 00:51:28,650
things that are easier to solve for

00:51:26,339 --> 00:51:32,400
rather than the rather than sites where

00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:34,549
the majority of the content is is it

00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:43,559
starting from production effectively

00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:44,970
thank you so a quick question on

00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:47,279
something that I'm sort of deeply

00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:50,039
passionate about which is contribution I

00:51:47,279 --> 00:51:52,470
know that you have done multiple

00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:54,779
contributions to to the Drupal ecosystem

00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:57,779
and you have part of your brought your

00:51:54,779 --> 00:52:00,059
your platform is out out on the world

00:51:57,779 --> 00:52:02,339
and part of it is internal so it's sort

00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:04,859
of a two-part question one is how do you

00:52:02,339 --> 00:52:07,559
manage that your internal developers

00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:08,760
your contractors contributing and how do

00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:11,579
they know what they can contribute what

00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:14,400
they can't contribute and the second one

00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:16,109
is how do you measure a sort of or can

00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,319
you measure some sort of ROI that is has

00:52:16,109 --> 00:52:21,119
this helped you like be better as the

00:52:19,319 --> 00:52:24,559
confusion helped you and how did you

00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:27,289
justify that internally to keep doing it

00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:30,059
good good good set of questions right so

00:52:27,289 --> 00:52:32,430
contributing contributing back it's

00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:33,809
something that absolutely needs needs to

00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:36,000
happen in order for this to work

00:52:33,809 --> 00:52:37,289
long-term be sustainable etc it's

00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,470
something that is without a doubt

00:52:37,289 --> 00:52:42,269
without a doubt has to happen but at the

00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:44,450
same time is of course not it's not the

00:52:42,269 --> 00:52:47,039
easiest of things of things to do I

00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:48,569
would say what we're really really

00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:53,009
getting started on what we're doing in

00:52:48,569 --> 00:52:54,809
this area now as its early days enough

00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:57,180
that it's early enough days you know 18

00:52:54,809 --> 00:52:58,980
months in that I would say we we we were

00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:00,180
learning a lot more from the community

00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,680
and we weren't really getting things to

00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:03,779
the quality that we could really add a

00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,839
huge amount of value until until the

00:53:03,779 --> 00:53:08,940
last six months or so so in the last six

00:53:06,839 --> 00:53:11,160
months or so we've had we've had larger

00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:13,890
projects inside WF tools there would be

00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:16,559
very beneficial to divert many other

00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:18,900
companies to implement so when there are

00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,519
cases like this it's it's in it's an

00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,950
agreement to it's an agreement with the

00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:24,349
individual develops whether they're in

00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:26,119
with a particular vendor to publish this

00:53:24,349 --> 00:53:27,650
this to Drupal to org or in some cases

00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:31,040
where it's not Drupal specifically to

00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:34,250
get help in a in an appropriate way so I

00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:35,720
would say that's it's largely just

00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:37,609
through close communication and

00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:39,170
expectation between my me and my team as

00:53:37,609 --> 00:53:42,410
to what what is appropriate and what

00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:44,750
isn't appropriate but really it's it's

00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:48,109
only starting to come up in more detail

00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:49,550
now is there are some of these there's

00:53:48,109 --> 00:53:51,650
some of these larger investments and

00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:53,660
they were making to fix problems that

00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:58,520
haven't been in widely fixed in other

00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:59,660
areas I'd say internally the my

00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,880
management in particular really

00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:04,430
understand the value from doing this

00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:06,349
there's there's there's a lot of great

00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:07,760
cases that I can go when I go into more

00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:08,780
detail and more specifics about what

00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:13,280
we've implemented and how successful

00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:15,079
that's been that really that's the

00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,940
opportunity to kind of grow and sell how

00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:18,020
we've managed to be so efficient riding

00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:21,349
up the back what other people have been

00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:22,730
built have built and and really the when

00:54:21,349 --> 00:54:24,440
you talk through the whole case of how

00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:25,609
we've been successful what we're

00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,589
building and how we want to contribute

00:54:25,609 --> 00:54:29,180
back is quite an easy story it's quite

00:54:27,589 --> 00:54:31,550
easy to understand why you have to do

00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:33,170
that and for these larger and larger

00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:36,079
investments were trying out or something

00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:37,430
like WF tools where we want other we

00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:39,589
want other companies to be using that

00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:41,810
and I think I hope that will be my case

00:54:39,589 --> 00:54:43,970
study to go and take and say hey we

00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:47,000
built this it perfectly met our use case

00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:48,470
it made us even faster and even even

00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,150
more efficient on these platforms and

00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:52,220
these other companies have adopted it

00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:53,660
and there's a result of that here is the

00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:55,700
here is the benefit we see from other

00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:57,950
people helping to maintain it so that

00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,839
would be my one first yeah I remember

00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:01,609
being in one of the meetings we had in

00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,380
New York where we sort of walked the

00:55:01,609 --> 00:55:05,810
rest of the Pfizer team through the

00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:07,730
views story and how you know views

00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:08,300
started out with a single company's

00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:10,130
investment

00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:12,620
you know has become the most popular

00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:15,170
module and now is moving into Drupal 8

00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:16,940
and you know it's very easy to quantify

00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:20,270
no Mike Myers does this in large-scale

00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:22,220
Drupal to say you might spend fifty

00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:23,840
thousand dollars but look two million

00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:26,120
dollars of investment has happened in

00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:27,940
this module you get to take advantage of

00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:30,380
that or you could do it yourself in

00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:31,430
that's an important story to tell I

00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:34,250
think it's an important piece of

00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:36,260
understanding the business model of open

00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:39,200
source and help to tell them hopefully

00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:41,360
you guys can hear me the one thing I

00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,790
will say and maybe you can talk my real

00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:46,550
quickly is the role of programs like

00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:48,890
large-scale Drupal to you know

00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:50,720
contribute in ways that may not be code

00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:52,910
but also but I move the project forward

00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,740
as well yeah absolutely social would

00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:57,920
were very also very excited about

00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:59,480
large-scale Drupal and that's where I

00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,730
see larger investments of things like

00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:04,520
the the WF tools project we're doing

00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:06,050
really really living well and I'm really

00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,520
excited about and this is this is

00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:09,680
something we talked with with with Mike

00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,930
about a lot but there is a huge huge

00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,670
potential there for where the time

00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:14,810
scales and the investment from a number

00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:16,550
of companies are there to the point the

00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:18,140
weekend we can really get into a model

00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:19,730
to collaboratively development on a few

00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:21,560
of these these areas because when you

00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:24,320
collaboratively development developing

00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:26,720
in an environment like like the LSD the

00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:28,700
LSD group it's much easier to then go

00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,800
and publish this and particularly not

00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:33,920
just publish it but productize it to

00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:36,560
something that the other companies can

00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,120
really pick up adopt and use so that's

00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,890
really the right home for doing these

00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:41,390
kind of things and I hope hope we can do

00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:46,820
a lot more in that kind of environment

00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:49,550
as well and fantastic thanks Brian you

00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:51,590
nicely articulated the sort of the

00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:54,410
challenges of taking a proprietary

00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:57,890
system cutting the corners of making

00:56:54,410 --> 00:57:00,800
nice and round I guess the question is a

00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:03,440
couple of parts for me so we've got the

00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:06,130
migration to Drupal 8 3 stuff on this

00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:08,660
this morning it's not going to be easy

00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:10,790
you've clearly built up a significant

00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:13,070
platform you've then got custom contrib

00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:15,560
you're developing that out I can see how

00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:20,069
that works from assess perspective

00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:23,759
obviously from a pass sort of buying

00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:26,880
what would you recommend to large-scale

00:57:23,759 --> 00:57:29,099
organizations or agencies to mitigate

00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,539
the risk of going from seven to eight

00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:33,150
you're clearly going to be held up as an

00:57:30,539 --> 00:57:37,199
exemplar so I think you're probably a

00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:39,599
good case study to show us how we could

00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:42,420
be in a good place in maybe six to nine

00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:44,249
months time right so it's a topic of a

00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:46,229
lot of love of a lot of debate of course

00:57:44,249 --> 00:57:47,640
at the moment and I'm sharing Mike's

00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:49,880
opinion here really rather than really

00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:52,619
the nothing has really been been clearly

00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:54,690
planned within Pfizer at this point but

00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:56,519
along with the discussion around moving

00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:59,219
from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 which were

00:57:56,519 --> 00:58:00,539
very excited about and were largely very

00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:01,920
excited about it because I expect to be

00:58:00,539 --> 00:58:03,690
talking about this platform a number of

00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,430
years and what we've continued to do

00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:06,900
with this platform rather than talking

00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:08,369
about the next technology that we picked

00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,359
up which is ultimately what can I happen

00:58:08,369 --> 00:58:11,489
it was going to happen if we just

00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:12,989
continue on with with seven we pointed

00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:15,180
to some of those challenges were seven

00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:17,009
that are not going to be fixed in seven

00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:18,930
those long-term solutions don't come at

00:58:17,009 --> 00:58:20,940
seven so we're very realistic about

00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:22,890
where we are and I would say as much as

00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:26,609
you see many many sites moving to Drupal

00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:28,319
you know several per week I think we may

00:58:26,609 --> 00:58:30,539
be would be doing more if it wasn't for

00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:32,339
the fact that we knew I was coming and

00:58:30,539 --> 00:58:34,529
you wanting to make the appropriate

00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:36,449
investment there I think there's a lot

00:58:34,529 --> 00:58:38,940
of discussion as well around a kind of

00:58:36,449 --> 00:58:40,920
quarter to my opinion of how I see us

00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:43,109
running this and there are our own

00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:45,329
migration there's lots of discussion

00:58:43,109 --> 00:58:47,759
around making eight backwards compatible

00:58:45,329 --> 00:58:49,680
with seven so not just canít be

00:58:47,759 --> 00:58:51,180
backwards compatible with seven but do a

00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,339
few large organizations want to get

00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:56,239
together and figure out a way to build

00:58:53,339 --> 00:58:58,199
some legacy module to make that happen I

00:58:56,239 --> 00:58:59,789
don't personally think that's that's

00:58:58,199 --> 00:59:01,829
there's something you should be pursued

00:58:59,789 --> 00:59:04,049
past that kind of sentence it's not

00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:06,660
you've got to be got to move on and I

00:59:04,049 --> 00:59:08,999
think if you get into a structure as we

00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:10,890
have where we're very clear on what

00:59:08,999 --> 00:59:12,269
these key functionalities are when

00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:13,680
you've implemented them once and you

00:59:12,269 --> 00:59:16,289
know there's these 50 things that I've

00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:17,910
got to get ready for Drupal 8 then the

00:59:16,289 --> 00:59:20,190
the investment across an organization

00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:22,380
this size to actually get those things

00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:23,999
migrated across the Drupal 8 is nowhere

00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:25,619
near the scale of investment as they

00:59:23,999 --> 00:59:29,609
switching from Drupal to another

00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:31,049
RG so it has to be the story has to be

00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:33,089
very clear and has to be well

00:59:31,049 --> 00:59:35,299
articulated to meet the expectations

00:59:33,089 --> 00:59:37,470
from a Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 migration

00:59:35,299 --> 00:59:39,359
don't let anybody begin to think it's

00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:43,140
going to be a one-button upgrade from

00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:45,049
from from from from any angle but I

00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:47,640
think having a platform strategy and

00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:49,589
having a good case of the the value of

00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:51,720
these platforms in a good case for the

00:59:49,589 --> 00:59:53,730
way they're going to go will will help

00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:55,109
that that's that's how I expect us to do

00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:57,329
this be very clear on what it will take

00:59:55,109 --> 00:59:58,890
for us to move to wait and I want us to

00:59:57,329 --> 00:59:59,970
be one of the companies leading leading

00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:02,220
the way I was to have one of the first

00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:05,069
first triple eight sites Simon volunteer

01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:07,950
do so you're all set good fine thanks

01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:09,660
bro great well Mike thank you so much

01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:12,950
for sharing a legend says is a fantastic

01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:12,950
