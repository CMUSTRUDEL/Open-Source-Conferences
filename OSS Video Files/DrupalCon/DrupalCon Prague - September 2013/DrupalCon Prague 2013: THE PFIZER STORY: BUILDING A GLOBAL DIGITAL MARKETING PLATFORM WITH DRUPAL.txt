Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: THE PFIZER STORY: BUILDING A GLOBAL DIGITAL MARKETING PLATFORM WITH DRUPAL
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	Managing an individual site is a complicated business. Managing hundreds of digital marketing sites across 46 countries is...the extreme.

Faced with an already challenging portfolio of sites and dueling mandates to increase time-to-market while reducing cost, Pfizer found a way to keep things simple and cost effective: Drupal.

Join Mike Lamb and Bryan House to learn how Pfizer stopped managing multiple code bases by building a digital marketing platform for hundreds of sites on Drupal running on Acquia Cloud. The session will consist of a presentation from Mike on how Pfizer uses Drupal at the core of its Digital Marketing platform and an fireside chat-style Q&A with Mike and Bryan about their experience.
