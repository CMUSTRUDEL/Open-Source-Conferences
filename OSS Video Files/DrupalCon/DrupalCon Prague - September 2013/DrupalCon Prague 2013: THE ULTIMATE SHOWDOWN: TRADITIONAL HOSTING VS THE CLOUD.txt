Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: THE ULTIMATE SHOWDOWN: TRADITIONAL HOSTING VS THE CLOUD
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	This presentation will be a no-holds-barred fight to the finish between Cloud hosting & Traditional managed hosting. Actually, in this Panel we will aim to objectively present the relative strengths and weaknesses associated with both Cloud and Managed hosting.

Your presenters will be Aaron Porter, from #AberdeenCloud, and Greg Harvey, from CodeEnigma. Both presenters are considered to be experts by many in their particular fields, and will present the subject matter in an entertaining and engaging way, which is certain to leave the audience feeling as though they have gained considerable knowledge regarding the different hosting options. This is a non-technical presentation which will be geared towards educating people about hosting options; it is not a SysAdmin "how to" session.

Some areas to be discussed:
1. CapEx
2. Productivity
3. Ux
4. Data security
5. Physical control
6. Performance
