Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: THE ULTIMATE SHOWDOWN: TRADITIONAL HOSTING VS THE CLOUD
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	This presentation will be a no-holds-barred fight to the finish between Cloud hosting & Traditional managed hosting. Actually, in this Panel we will aim to objectively present the relative strengths and weaknesses associated with both Cloud and Managed hosting.

Your presenters will be Aaron Porter, from #AberdeenCloud, and Greg Harvey, from CodeEnigma. Both presenters are considered to be experts by many in their particular fields, and will present the subject matter in an entertaining and engaging way, which is certain to leave the audience feeling as though they have gained considerable knowledge regarding the different hosting options. This is a non-technical presentation which will be geared towards educating people about hosting options; it is not a SysAdmin "how to" session.

Some areas to be discussed:
1. CapEx
2. Productivity
3. Ux
4. Data security
5. Physical control
6. Performance

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,810
good afternoon everybody my name is my

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,150
name is Simon I'm form antonova and thus

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:13,620
afternoon i'm here to present to you the

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,780
ultimate showdown in hosting first of

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,289
all I'd like to say that this is a panel

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,980
session and it is on the business and

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:25,260
strategy track it is a non technical

00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:28,320
presentation okay so if you're expecting

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,250
deep technical insight into our hosting

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,600
solutions this isn't where you should be

00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,130
but if you want to learn about making

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,320
hosting decisions and the right place

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,450
where you should host your projects then

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:44,730
it will give you some good insight to

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:47,760
that I've actually explained the the

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,710
fight rules for this afternoon this is

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,559
not a debate it's going to be a point by

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,829
point of view of the key hosting

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,390
decision drivers okay so this afternoon

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,840
we're going to present points for these

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,480
three options traditional hosting kind

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:11,360
of DIY build your own managed hosting

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:11,360
service and platform as a service okay

00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:25,430
so I'd like to introduce to you from the

00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,310
white corner representing

00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:37,580
platform-as-a-service Aaron from

00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:40,460
Aberdeen cloud a PS provider in the

00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:48,979
black corner representing fair metal in

00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:51,259
hell Rupert Romero a b2b publish our and

00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:53,539
in the blue corner representing managed

00:01:51,259 --> 00:02:01,479
hosting its great from code enigma a

00:01:53,539 --> 00:02:03,830
developer and hosting companies so

00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:06,590
specialized wife keeps me going to

00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,880
briefly explain their platform then

00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,540
after that we're going to go through

00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:16,840
points looking at the benefit this body

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:19,400
is the week so oh you are alright so

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,850
thanks everybody for coming nice to see

00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,280
the turnout Aberdeen cloud we provide a

00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:28,160
platform as a service it's a cloud

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,160
hosting and development solution it is

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,799
out of the box ready to go everything

00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:38,720
from very small sites to enterprise

00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:41,090
level solutions oh wow my mark friends

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,420
really loud so I villa I'm Greg from

00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:46,310
code enigma we tend to be more on the

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,660
managed service sites so we help people

00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,540
manage their own infrastructure

00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,910
potentially or manage infrastructure

00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,959
that we've helped them to set up

00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:57,530
sometimes it's in the cloud sometimes

00:02:53,959 --> 00:03:02,859
it's bare metal but it's not a platform

00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:07,100
like Aaron's business-to-business

00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:10,190
publisher called Eric we've run five ish

00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,620
sites and we sell basically niche

00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:17,709
information for specific industries like

00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,709
automotive food drink and style and

00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:29,379
okay so the first thing we're on one

00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:32,870
capital expenditure make a cat ate right

00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:35,599
so we've recently relaunched one of our

00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:38,569
biggest sites and to do that we built a

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,819
new infrastructure for it and we had a

00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:42,709
fairly low capital expenditure for that

00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:44,930
because we have a lot of what we need it

00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:47,540
already so we have an office with about

00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,489
50 people in it and you have that many

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,040
people in office you have a pretty big

00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:54,409
pipe into it so it's pretty easy just to

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,889
slip another server into the rack and

00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:58,909
set up our infrastructure on that and

00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:01,159
you're probably thinking about a new

00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:04,010
server that's money but all our servers

00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:07,159
come off eBay and that might sound

00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:09,049
insane but the reason we do that is one

00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:11,989
of the guys in the office he's really

00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:14,389
good at so sourcing Hardware making sure

00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:16,400
it works setting up right and stick it

00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:19,340
in the rack so us developers can take it

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,380
over so for a pretty low expenditure we

00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:24,259
have a crazy overpowered servant it's

00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,300
like a a core xeon the 32 gig around and

00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:27,590
we have an identical one sitting next to

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,580
it which we can either switch to your

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:36,020
cannibalize as appropriate alright so

00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:38,509
our take on capital expenditures it's

00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,419
not just buying the the bare metal and

00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:44,210
the actual servers and everything to

00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:47,659
make everything work which it often is

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:49,789
thought of but upfront costs and capex

00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:52,070
we're also talking about the biggest

00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:54,259
part of that expenditure and that is

00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:57,590
exactly the people and their salaries

00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:59,110
that it takes to set up those systems so

00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,220
the people who designed the systems

00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,099
purchase the parts put everything

00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:07,550
together test the stuff install the

00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:09,169
software configure tune and tweak that's

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,020
all money that has to come out of pocket

00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:14,180
when you're not using cloud so with the

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,620
cloud services or platform services you

00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,320
don't have to come up with a sizeable

00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:20,570
investment to pay for the hardware or

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,669
the salaries for the people to design

00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,800
the systems and implement the

00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:27,320
architecture it's actually a

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,169
pay-as-you-go from the moment you sign

00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,259
up

00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:32,849
you just pay for what you use and most

00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:37,379
companies today don't even require a

00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:40,680
minimum contract okay well I mean I I

00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:43,499
can see both sides of that argument from

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,819
our perspective I think the whole capex

00:05:43,499 --> 00:05:47,819
argument shifts depending on what you're

00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:50,370
trying to do for example if you're an

00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:52,080
agency that's got lots of websites you

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,460
could potentially run them all on a

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,110
small cluster of servers or something

00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,879
like that then it's going to be more

00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,740
cost effective to do it that way then it

00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,080
will be to run them on a platform where

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,400
you have to pay per site so if you're in

00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,659
a reseller situation if you're in a

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,400
situation where you've got a lot of

00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:07,080
websites to host but each website

00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,849
doesn't actually need very much resource

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,560
you're probably better off with your own

00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:11,699
machines whether that's managed or or

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,159
you're managing them yourselves it

00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:16,800
doesn't really matter so yeah I mean

00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:18,270
it's a sliding scale depending on how

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,520
many sites you got what kind of traffic

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,379
they're handling whether you've got

00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,210
internal resource already like Rupert

00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:25,889
does or as not as Aaron says some people

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:32,430
don't or all the training up would be

00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:36,599
expensive so so in various well round to

00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:38,310
flexibility so am I carry on at this

00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:41,129
point and I think in terms of

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:43,500
flexibility what an organization like

00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:46,080
ours offers is pretty much second to

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,779
none because essentially what we do is

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,520
manage linux servers for people so if

00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:53,310
you've got a development team that just

00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,919
want to kind of get in there and use the

00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:57,779
software what we allow you to do is

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,399
basically forget about all of the

00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:01,199
running of Linux and all of that stuff

00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,909
it doesn't matter whether it's your own

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,879
servers or whether it's something that's

00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:08,279
been put in the cloud on virtualized

00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:09,960
hardware it makes no difference the

00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:11,939
point is that your servers managed by

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,999
you and you can do whatever you like

00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:17,460
with them or we do is manage the backups

00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:19,289
and the keeping things up today and the

00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,149
security and everything else late you

00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:25,289
worry about running Drupal on top of

00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:28,379
that so yeah we can run pretty much

00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:30,960
whenever we like and when we do so our

00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:31,900
current platform is debian 6 varnish

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,199
engine X

00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:37,449
cash pakona solar ticker and prints xml

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,800
and if you haven't heard of the last two

00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:40,900
because they're probably the bubbles

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,780
their ticker is a thing that extracts

00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:46,509
meaning for documents and prints xml the

00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:48,759
tool for producing pdfs and they're kind

00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:50,500
of filled balls in the stack they of

00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:53,680
what you know a platform couldn't

00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:56,110
provide so you know we have all those

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,210
things set up exactly as our application

00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,949
needs it and if we want to add a new

00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,449
service in the future to you know

00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:04,389
supporting your feature we absolutely

00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:08,880
can I think this is where self-hosting

00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:13,060
beats anything else all right so

00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:15,789
flexibility yeah cloud platform loses

00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:18,070
this one we don't really give people all

00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:20,740
the access to things some of our special

00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,780
sauce in the background but I would say

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:27,520
to be fair it would only be by the

00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:29,740
smallest of margins cloud platforms are

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,990
meant to be closed systems and the

00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,300
reason for that is there not servers

00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:37,450
right they're distributed systems so

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:40,500
although true distributed systems they

00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:43,630
will include specialized nodes that

00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:46,779
serve one that one dedicated function

00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:49,450
and only that function custom apps and

00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:53,700
services run on separate server nodes so

00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:56,170
it's much more inflexible as a system

00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,270
but i don't know i would say it's

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:01,660
definitely in our mind it's more secure

00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:04,870
that way because suppose your ruby base

00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:07,170
ticketing system has a bug which a

00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:10,089
hacker uses to break into the server

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:12,100
well there isn't much to do since the

00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:15,100
app runs on its own dedicated server

00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:17,500
node and most of your data code and

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:26,320
content will remain secure on their own

00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:28,260
server nodes granthi skills sharing so

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,850
lets me to lead off on this one again

00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:34,540
hmmm skills showing is an interesting

00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,190
one i guess it matters more to myself

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,600
and Ruth

00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:43,980
it does Erin insofar as that obviously

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:46,070
because we're providing machines and in

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,860
Rupert's case there's internal machines

00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:52,470
that have linux on then there's a degree

00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,210
of knowledge required there now I see

00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,730
this as an opportunity because a lot of

00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:59,100
our customers will already have very

00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,570
good IT teams in place that are already

00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,640
managing infrastructure for them that

00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,140
may not be Linux infrastructure it may

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,240
be something else typically it's

00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,390
microsoft and there's an opportunity

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,000
here to actually transfer our knowledge

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:13,470
to our customers teams we're used to

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,910
doing on-site training we used to

00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,280
mentoring people and taking them through

00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:20,340
the experience of shifting from other

00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:23,670
hosting solutions on to manage Linux

00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:26,220
servers and I think you you know you

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:28,650
grow the value of your team by taking

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,660
that approach because actually they can

00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:33,000
learn as your business changes

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:38,400
technology and that adds value to them

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,290
and it adds value to you yeah so i would

00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,270
actually i would actually list this as a

00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,070
trade off or i think from our

00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:46,530
perspective there'd be a trade-off

00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,900
because on the one hand well i

00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:52,320
completely agree with Greg's comments

00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:55,350
about skills sharing our perspective

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,960
would be that it's a plus to not need

00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,710
this to not need to be able to do skills

00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:04,590
sharing the impact of not needing

00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:08,190
specialized skills and and also

00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:10,110
specialized systems is twofold first of

00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,270
all the absence of having system

00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:15,020
administrators and specialists on your

00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:19,290
on your team no longer prevents you from

00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:21,390
competing at the enterprise level puts

00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:23,550
enterprise contracts within the reach of

00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:26,280
the average development shop without

00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:28,200
having specialized personnel so in

00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:31,260
realistic terms it means that a handful

00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,760
of talented Drupal deaths with nothing

00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,610
more than a credit card and their own

00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,589
talent could be chasing and winning

00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:41,310
contracts at the same level of some of

00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:44,390
the bigger companies the second part of

00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:46,019
that would be it's sad to say but

00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:48,509
considering the

00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:52,980
economic uncertainty of the time that we

00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:55,619
live in every dollar euro check crown

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:58,920
whatever local currency you're using

00:11:55,619 --> 00:12:02,489
that you spend on the business is money

00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:05,399
out of the businesses pocket so the fact

00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:08,519
is adding people and trying to improve

00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,949
productivity by having specialists is an

00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,230
expensive approach specialists can be

00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:16,410
very expensive and the plaintiff simple

00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:21,149
fact is polished systems remove the need

00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:23,670
for sysadmin specialists to light greg

00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:25,559
said skills that sharing is pretty much

00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:28,019
essential to how we operate as a

00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:30,269
business so we're a relatively small

00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,799
team you know we're quite experienced

00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:35,399
and we have a lot of overlap just to

00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:37,709
reduce the bus factor and so I'm a

00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,360
developer them personally I like

00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:42,179
operating in an environment where I have

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,149
to learn things you know why I do what I

00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:47,429
do it's fun and we're a slowly growing

00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:49,049
company and the bosses frequently say

00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:51,059
they don't want to grow the business too

00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:53,369
fast because you know they want to avoid

00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:56,339
the tendency to boom and bust as a

00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:58,499
business so yeah errands right you know

00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:01,290
we're not going to be serving you know

00:12:58,499 --> 00:13:02,490
thousands of pages tomorrow you know

00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,379
we're not going to be getting an

00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,360
enterprise stuff tomorrow but the

00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:08,699
business is slowly going to grow and as

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,829
a team we can grow with the traffic and

00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:16,610
the demands on the system and scale up

00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:19,069
with it okay next point physical control

00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:22,799
all right I'll take the lead on this one

00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:27,059
physical control there is no argument I

00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:29,610
have never have no argument there if you

00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:33,929
want to tinker with hardware pause is

00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:37,079
not the right solution for you okay Paul

00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:39,480
is this built so that you don't have to

00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:41,429
tinker with hardware so I cannot

00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,549
reiterate that enough if you like to

00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:47,699
tinker Paulus is not the right thing if

00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:50,040
if you just want to get in and do some

00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:53,309
drupal dev stuff okay it might be a

00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:56,100
faster approach so Paul systems are

00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:56,950
typically built on type on top of some

00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,380
sort of cloud

00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:00,760
offering you have to remember i think

00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,700
actually we might have I might have

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,770
skipped a point before cloud offerings

00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,470
usually come in the form of just

00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:11,560
infrastructure then platforms and then

00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:13,560
software's so pause is built on top of

00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,020
our cloud offering usually

00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:20,380
infrastructure like Amazon Rackspace so

00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:23,020
therefore any time you use pause you're

00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:25,630
also subject to the availability of the

00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:28,030
initial cloud provider if you use one

00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:30,030
without multiple data centers you may

00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:31,980
experience increased latency

00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:34,990
non-compliance with certain government

00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:37,360
regulations and you might not have true

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,760
high availability it's always good

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,990
practice to look at these things before

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:46,030
signing any sort of contracts so yeah

00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,590
self-hosting pretty much wins physical

00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:50,220
control if you want to go and give your

00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:52,450
server a good kicking you absolutely can

00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,270
although it's obviously not a huge

00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:57,940
advantage don't really like that and you

00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:59,920
know I worked remotely so for all i know

00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,200
the surface might actually be in a data

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,350
center somewhere even stairs in the

00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:07,900
office where there is the big advantage

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:10,630
there is an transparency which is a sort

00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,640
of control so because we built these

00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:14,920
servers and everything around them we

00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,990
know exactly what's set up there you

00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,030
know if you're using someone's paths and

00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,890
they say they're highly available are

00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:23,320
they highly available at every level of

00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,910
stack that you want if they're saying

00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,740
they're doing backups are they sticking

00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:28,810
to the backup routine they promised you

00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:32,020
know we know that we are because we're

00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:34,180
doing it one slight downside is

00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:37,210
obviously physical control doesn't

00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:39,340
necessarily mean move you know doing

00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:41,800
stuff physically to the machine on

00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:43,270
something like in a cloud service you

00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,190
may be able to pick up a machine and

00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:46,870
move it to a different data center which

00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,500
can't really do if you've got an actual

00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,500
but

00:15:49,899 --> 00:16:00,440
can you need a van yeah so I think I

00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:02,660
know I'm glad that Aaron brought up the

00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,399
point about the different uses for the

00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,500
cloud and you know platform being one

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,560
and infrastructure being another from

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:12,769
our perspective when we're managing

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,389
servers for people it doesn't make a

00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:18,829
great deal of difference to us where

00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:21,019
that where that server is so you know it

00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:23,089
could be your existing infrastructure or

00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:25,250
it could be that actually you want to

00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:27,500
leverage some of the power of the cloud

00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:30,019
but only at an infrastructure level in

00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,699
which case you know you might want to

00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:36,199
commission some virtual machines and

00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:39,500
have those managed so we kind of offer a

00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:41,870
trade off and you can go as far as you

00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,250
like you can either go completely into

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,870
the cloud and say okay we want

00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,579
everything virtualized or you can say

00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,899
actually you know what we've bought our

00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:49,760
own servers but we really don't want the

00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:51,170
hassle of having to deal with these so

00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,639
we like the fact that they're physically

00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,959
here in our basement and we like the

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,390
fact that we're controlling the

00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:57,890
bandwidth and all this kind of stuff but

00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:00,800
we don't want to be bothered with

00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:05,030
managing Linux and you know that's

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:08,540
that's quite a common approach for a lot

00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:10,669
of companies in terms of when we do go

00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:13,459
into the cloud we we have preferred

00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:15,439
suppliers of course but I mean we can

00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:17,089
really run these things anyway I mean

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,740
that's that's the point it goes back a

00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:20,329
little bit to the flexibility stuff but

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,120
you know you can have the physical

00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:25,280
control and still have the kind of

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,809
management that allows you to maybe have

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:32,480
a reduced system administration team and

00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:34,130
the other thing I would say is with our

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,960
model you have kind of full access to

00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:38,150
all the software so you know you can

00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,970
check up on us and just like we was

00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:42,110
saying with it with it with a platform

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,340
you just kind of got to take their word

00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,410
for it that they're doing all the things

00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,700
that they said they do whereas with us

00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:48,200
you know you have full access to the

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,470
monitoring you have full access to the

00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,240
to the backups the back of locations you

00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,250
can run your own restore ziff you want

00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,620
you know it's all it's quite transparent

00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:59,950
it's almost as though you're hosting

00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,950
yourself

00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:07,120
okay round five separation so this is a

00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,460
point where we have a bit of risk

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,170
because we use the same connectivity for

00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,810
our servers that we do for our office

00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:15,490
stuff and you know if all my colleagues

00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,500
decided to fire up YouTube at the same

00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:20,380
time I don't know what happened website

00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:25,630
and obviously if you're co-located that

00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:27,490
doesn't apply so you know once you've

00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:28,690
got to the servers because you have to

00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,190
control over the server's you can

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,290
separate things how you like you know

00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:34,930
you can stick everything in one box you

00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:37,090
can a box / machine builder in a little

00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:44,740
private cloud if you wanted so you know

00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:47,980
you can separate things how you like how

00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:52,480
is it me I want so okay so yeah so on

00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:54,520
the separation side of things I think it

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,770
depends on the situation because of our

00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:00,730
because of our flexibility again with

00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:01,900
with the management service sometimes it

00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,180
depends on the way the client has

00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:07,300
decided to lay things out sometimes it's

00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:10,000
down to us obviously if you put stuff in

00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,830
the cloud even if it's just to that

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,410
infrastructure level you might have

00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:17,530
concerns about having potentially

00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:21,330
multiple VMs on a single physical

00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:24,790
machine that's certainly a possibility

00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,290
you don't again you're unlikely to have

00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,760
the level of transparency with an

00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,770
infrastructure cloud provider of the

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,180
sort that we might use to know whether

00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,980
actually you're taking more of a risk

00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:35,410
than you think because you've got four

00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,120
servers but actually Rackspace or linode

00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,530
whoever it is you've contracted with

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,880
have put them all on the same physical

00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:45,340
machine they as possible you know so on

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,520
the vm side of things we run some of the

00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,870
same risks that platform might run but

00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,750
obviously we don't have to take that

00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:57,130
route we can use bare metal servers and

00:19:52,750 --> 00:20:00,160
in terms of the the actual hardware

00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:02,200
separation obviously what we sell them

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,690
what we manage our individual separate

00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,090
machines there's no shared resource on a

00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,670
single machine you'll never sharing your

00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:11,680
resource with somebody else on that

00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:13,660
actual machine it's always complete and

00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,000
operation own IP address own mac address

00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:17,830
on devices etc all that stuff is just

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,370
the note from a security perspective is

00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:26,890
completely isolated alright so yeah

00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:29,770
that's a lot of that's true or i would

00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:33,460
say both points there there sometimes

00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:36,910
there is a lack of separation a lot of a

00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:40,200
lot of pause offerings are set up as a

00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:42,820
shared system in these cases the

00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:47,200
provider has created a shared

00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:50,350
architecture that is it allows the end

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:53,890
user to utilize a shared resource point

00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:56,740
point sorry pool so why would they do

00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,360
that well when people set up Paul's like

00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:01,030
that they do it because it drives the

00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,160
cost down right you're able to utilize

00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:07,480
more processing power and pay less for

00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:09,310
it so the idea is to offer scalability

00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,720
and infrastructure scalability at a

00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:15,790
better price point however an important

00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,710
point about this is I would say that's

00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:21,820
that's actually a quite antiquated

00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:28,120
approach to utilizing cloud services

00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:32,020
that's so 2011 right it's it's it's a

00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:36,460
remnant of the era of shared servers and

00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:39,130
cheap hosting okay but most cloud

00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:43,690
services now they're moving beyond this

00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:48,550
so i would say any decent pause platform

00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:50,950
is not a bunch of servers and physical

00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:53,770
resources are virtualized in these case

00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:57,160
so therefore their shared the resource

00:21:53,770 --> 00:22:00,190
pools become dedicated it's a it's a

00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,720
distributed system so it's a better

00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,430
approach and if you're looking and

00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,230
considering pause that's something that

00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:07,260
you might want to consider or you run

00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:10,000
into these lack of separation issues

00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:12,460
because there are many providers that

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,260
are doing it that way but you can also

00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:16,540
get distributed systems where you have

00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:19,240
dedicated resources and that's that's

00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:20,310
really sort of the way forward at least

00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,170
in my opinion for

00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:25,950
this sort of pause and cloud offerings

00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:29,520
so how no i'd say if you have if you

00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:32,490
have no doubts about using Rackspace or

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,800
amazon as it is now or any other cloud

00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:37,710
infrastructure that which actually

00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,330
provide you virtualized instances you

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,200
shouldn't really be afraid of using

00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:45,240
cloud platforms either just do your

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:51,480
homework first if it's that important of

00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:55,770
an issue for you Rancic scalability and

00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:59,310
performance yeah so this one take the

00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:02,220
lead on that because well again smart

00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:06,030
cloud systems are designed to grow as

00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:10,920
you grow and this can be both long-term

00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:12,870
growth and short term growth with by and

00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,450
I'll clarify by long-term growth I'm

00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:18,630
talking about sites just sites

00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:21,660
themselves that start out small over the

00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:24,150
course of its business lifetime and as

00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:26,370
it becomes more and more popular you

00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:28,620
need more and more resources this could

00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:31,380
also be considered the same argument for

00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:34,320
any small development agency you start

00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,780
out a couple of people and over time you

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,730
need to keep adding resources well that

00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,770
almost goes back to the capex argument

00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:43,860
so I won't repeat myself there but the

00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:47,340
idea is that you can just grow as needed

00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:49,380
instead of trying to anticipate how much

00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,690
growth that you're going to need the

00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,450
second thing is the short term and in

00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:58,050
the short term I would say this is a big

00:23:54,450 --> 00:24:00,560
one because if you got you know if any

00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:03,420
company here creates a great site and

00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:06,240
suddenly that site is featured in Wired

00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:10,410
magazine and your traffic is about to go

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,780
from 1,000 hits a day to a million hits

00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:15,660
a day you need to be able to scale up to

00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:19,380
that sort of traffic immediately and

00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:23,040
again a smart cloud system should allow

00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:24,570
you to provision those resources some in

00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,250
some cases literally just drag the

00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:28,290
slider bar where you want it to be and

00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:30,750
say how much computing

00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:32,820
as you need and by the time it updates

00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,500
into the cloud you should be able to

00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:39,600
have enough computing resources to

00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:41,550
handle those kind of big loads so we're

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,770
in a pretty unusual position with regard

00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:46,560
scalability because we have total

00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:47,940
control over our traffic and the reason

00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,010
for that is our site subscription-only

00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:53,640
so we can predict our traffic levels and

00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:55,800
we can scale up as we need to as yet we

00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,210
actually haven't had howdy cuz right

00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,310
like I said right back at the start

00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:00,630
because we got really good deal on our

00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:03,270
servers and then massively over

00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:06,600
specified so we know we have room to

00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:08,400
grow for the foreseeable future but if

00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,990
we were in a position where we couldn't

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:15,480
predict our traffic to that level I

00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:22,320
probably looking at a cloud service or

00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:23,880
us points yeah yeah well yeah we you

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,860
know it comes back to the whole thing of

00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,820
well what was your choice at the outset

00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:32,010
are you running bare metal hardware or

00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:33,060
are you running on virtualized

00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:35,850
infrastructure if you're running on

00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:37,770
virtualized infrastructure sure there's

00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:40,200
no way I can say here and tell you that

00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:42,210
you can slider slider and add five

00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,670
virtual machines to your layout it

00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:46,200
doesn't work like that we can scale we

00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:49,890
can't scale as rapidly as a platform

00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,480
that we can scale rapidly using the

00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:53,400
tools that are available these days you

00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,170
know the lib cloud API and puppet and

00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,910
tools like this that allow you to build

00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:59,310
servers and deploy software onto them

00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:01,440
you know we can scale up a site in a

00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:06,240
matter of hours not minutes hours but we

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:08,070
can do it so and I would make the point

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,780
that nobody provides a auto scaling that

00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:12,600
i'm aware of Aaron Maynard now say hey

00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:17,850
we do I don't know coming soon coming

00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:20,010
seven yay but yeah no no nobody that I

00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:21,690
know of provides auto scaling somebody

00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:23,580
still got to sit there and slide the

00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:25,500
slider and then at least with a managed

00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:27,240
service you can be confidently you've

00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,680
got monitoring systems in place and

00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,630
you've got experts watching those

00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,990
machines watching for load changes and

00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:37,020
being ready and enabled to react so you

00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:39,000
know we can provide a level of rapid

00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:41,850
scaling if the infrastructure choices

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,549
were right so the

00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:47,580
it's not a one-horse race but if you

00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:49,679
need to scale up and down really rapidly

00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:59,880
on a regular basis you probably want a

00:26:49,679 --> 00:27:02,520
platform round 7 aux productivity so

00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:06,470
basically self-hosting has good you

00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,470
access you think Bosch has good ux

00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,660
obviously there's loads of other stuff

00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,159
you need to work out yourself like you

00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,659
know how to order the right hardware how

00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,570
to build your environment you'll learn

00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:21,270
your tools it's a long list there's a

00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:24,120
lot of stuff that you need to learn you

00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:31,669
know you can't just go slide slide isn't

00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:35,370
take boxes all right so here's the thing

00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:41,130
the way we look at it user experience is

00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:43,799
the key to productivity and yeah I beat

00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:48,059
the same drum quite often but one of my

00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:50,700
points is people are costly so in order

00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:55,020
to increase productivity is it best to

00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:57,870
add more human resources or add smarter

00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:00,450
processes and systems having all the

00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:03,270
tools that well our opinion basically

00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:06,299
attend to that obviously would be UX is

00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:10,799
the key to your productivity as a Drupal

00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:13,950
agency as a agency that creates new

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:16,260
things so having all the tools needed

00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:20,720
for most Drupal projects already

00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:25,260
configured and available in one simple

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:27,539
either graphical user interface or in

00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:30,090
some cases you can also have a your own

00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:33,090
command line interface fully integrated

00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:34,679
with the system and have you know having

00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:36,419
everything they're available you've got

00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:39,600
your dress you've got get you've got

00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:41,610
solar etc all of those things just at

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:46,200
the touch of a button or a line of code

00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:48,240
and enter the advantage of that results

00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:52,650
in an easy-to-use system that is

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,870
designed for one goal and that one goal

00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:59,790
to increase or maximize your

00:28:54,870 --> 00:29:02,970
productivity I'd say that that's it's

00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:05,550
hard to even compare productivity to the

00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:06,990
sign up and go approach if you have a

00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:09,330
good system and you're using a good

00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:12,500
system you should be able to sign up and

00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:16,500
literally create a high-availability

00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:18,990
website and push it live on to the net

00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,940
within 15 minutes doesn't mean that the

00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:23,160
site's going to be a beautiful sight

00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,720
winning in your awards or anything but

00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:29,130
you should have that sort of usability

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,690
in a good platform so and if and if you

00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:34,050
don't think that's possible i'll give

00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:36,150
you a link for ad rush archive right now

00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:37,950
anybody that wants to try the last time

00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:40,500
I did it it took seven minutes and 50

00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:42,120
seconds so and I'm not a techie so you

00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,660
know that's that says a lot for

00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:49,020
productivity anyway the last thing I

00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:51,540
would say is different can I say just a

00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:54,960
show of hands has anybody ever actually

00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:57,570
built a distributed system I think you I

00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,620
know right oh yeah anybody else

00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:03,870
distributed systems got Pedro number two

00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:08,550
no more of those yeah so just a handful

00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:10,560
of people and I mean how many hours are

00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:13,680
lost and I'm not going to shout to

00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,360
everybody but I have have any estimate

00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:21,330
on hours on setting up a distributed

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:22,970
system God days days and did that even

00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:26,040
did that even include high availability

00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:29,040
yeah that would include higher over T so

00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:31,770
the main point is every hour that you're

00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:35,130
spending some specialist to design these

00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:41,970
systems is an hour that you're losing on

00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:44,250
Drupal development right so so yeah I

00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:46,830
suppose you know on the UX side of

00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:51,060
things starting at the more simplistic

00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:53,790
level for sure we don't have the sleek

00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:55,440
user interface of something like a

00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:57,570
platform service and pretty much all the

00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,180
platform providers have pretty sweet

00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:03,060
kind of built in version control systems

00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:04,010
high productivity tools so that is

00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,300
excellent

00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:09,140
I can't deny it I used them myself

00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:12,500
sometimes they're it's really really

00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:14,630
good so you know we can't match that but

00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,720
I guess what we do is we make it as

00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:20,020
usable as possible so we try to provide

00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,980
tools so for example we provide

00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,540
continuous integration with a tool

00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,850
called Jenkins which means that when

00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:27,520
your developers actually have finished

00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,870
on a piece of code they can just push it

00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:32,000
back into the central version control

00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:34,370
system and it builds automatically which

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,550
is kind of the same way as it works with

00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:39,260
with the platform stuff except that ours

00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:41,000
is much more you can see the wheels

00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,410
turning and the rods pushing and

00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,360
everything whereas with the platform

00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:46,220
it's just all just just happens by magic

00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:49,040
and there's just a little spinning disk

00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:50,750
in the corner so you know everything's a

00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:55,910
lot more exposed with us but I think a

00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:58,310
lot of the tools are there and it's more

00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:00,590
a case of kind of getting used to the

00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:02,240
differences different ways of working

00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,950
and the fact that you know for example

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,930
you'll have to go and log into your

00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:07,280
monitoring over here and your CI over

00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:08,690
there and they won't just all be in one

00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,720
nice dashboard they're in different

00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:13,310
places we try to get around that with

00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,020
single sign-on solution you know you

00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,220
only have one account so that you log

00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,410
into everything with the same account

00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:21,860
and all of that stuff so you know we do

00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:26,150
our best but it's no it's no platform

00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:28,970
dashboard but that you know I think that

00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:30,590
the key point there is what you losing

00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:32,480
musics user experience you gain in

00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:36,200
flexibility and circle back to the

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,030
flexibility point yeah okay we we don't

00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,430
have a fancy dashboard that you can you

00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:42,740
can slide things up and down and that

00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:44,510
kind of thing but you know if you want

00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,220
to run sugarcrm no problem just run

00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:48,920
sugarcrm is a linux server it doesn't

00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:52,760
care so it depends on what you what

00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:57,470
you're doing okay let's take a look at

00:32:52,760 --> 00:33:02,060
security okay my first on this one I

00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:04,940
think it's me actually so yeah I mean on

00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:09,590
the security side of things I guess we

00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:13,610
we straddle a line because we are

00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:16,620
because we are not in total control of

00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:19,170
the hardware that we provide our service

00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,640
ever whether it's a customer's hardware

00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:23,280
or whether it's in the cloud is not ours

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,660
it's not our physical servers so you

00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,640
know we have to take a certain amount of

00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,870
physical security for granted we have to

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:32,309
assume if it's virtualized

00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:34,110
infrastructure that organizations are

00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:37,020
providing that infrastructure is doing

00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:40,950
things diligently that the you know the

00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:42,930
underlying vmware is is well made and

00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:46,800
the virtual machines are well separated

00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:50,570
and that kind of thing so you know from

00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:53,220
my perspective were only as secure as

00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:57,200
you know the physical security of your

00:33:53,220 --> 00:34:00,809
server room if you're Rupert or the

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:03,630
physical the online security of your

00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:07,140
linode dashboard or whatever it is that

00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:10,440
you've decided to go with but you know

00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,310
having said that it kind of goes back to

00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,530
the point that we were making before

00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:15,360
about sharing of resources and the

00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:16,800
reason though sharing of resources with

00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,770
other organizations with us you know

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,629
your organization your data your servers

00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:23,280
everything is just yours and the only

00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:25,800
people that can access those servers are

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,720
our privileged system administrators

00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,750
staff and people that you tell us that

00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:33,419
can and that that's it and we do all of

00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:35,760
the security updates and patching for

00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:37,620
you we do that transparently I think I'm

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,649
fairly confident we've got you know

00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:43,350
stricter security and firewall protocols

00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:49,169
in place than pretty much anyone else

00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:50,909
and you know we're as far as that's

00:34:49,169 --> 00:34:53,850
concerned I think we're transparently

00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:56,600
and demonstrably more secure as a

00:34:53,850 --> 00:35:00,150
platform than most of the people can be

00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:01,650
and even on the physical security side

00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:04,740
of things at least if you ask us to

00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:07,740
Commission hardware for you virtualized

00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:09,690
or physical it will be in an ISO 27001

00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:12,000
data center it's not going to be in some

00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:14,280
basement or anything like that it's

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,990
going to be in racks in proper

00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:23,490
physically secure data centers that are

00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:26,130
certified so yeah so okay data security

00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:28,800
I don't really actually consider

00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:31,500
this a con even though it's a big hot

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,780
topic around cloud stuff it's in the

00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:37,200
cloud we don't actually have the servers

00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:38,640
in our basement and I mean it's

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,470
definitely a con in the mindset of

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,020
people that are still getting used to

00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:45,420
cloud ideas for sure and I don't I don't

00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:47,940
invalidate that but I would say it's

00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:51,270
it's I call it smoke and mirrors

00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:54,540
approach really basically because of

00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:56,790
this we all live in the in the digital

00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:59,340
age and the fact of living in the

00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:02,510
digital age is data security and

00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:06,030
vulnerability of information is a

00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:10,440
persistent danger in the world that we

00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:11,970
live in and you know i would ask anybody

00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,150
that that is worried about cloud

00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:19,140
security where do you really think your

00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:21,360
data is safer in the system and I'm and

00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:23,340
I mean no offense to Greg or anybody

00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:26,370
else here does it this way but in a

00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:29,430
system that you and you know you're

00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:34,590
great team built somewhere whether it's

00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:36,980
in a secure location or not or in a data

00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:39,210
center with you know somebody like

00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:42,260
Amazon or Rackspace or something like

00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:46,920
that that is literally investing

00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:49,260
billions of dollars every year to

00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,690
increase their security to add machines

00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:54,810
and not only on the physical side but to

00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:57,290
hire the best and the brightest people

00:36:54,810 --> 00:37:01,380
that they can find to run those systems

00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:04,980
now I've made that argument before and

00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:07,530
somebody responded to me yeah but you

00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:11,310
know where do you who's the likely or

00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:13,710
target amazon or my shop nobody knows

00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:17,540
who we are and i say that if your

00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:20,820
argument for data security is anonymity

00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:24,520
then it's not really a very good

00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:28,000
argument in my mind true amazon is more

00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:30,010
has a higher profile but they also have

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,430
the resources to back it up and I I

00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:35,410
personally would trust a company that is

00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:37,630
investing that kind of money and hiring

00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:42,010
those people more than I would trust

00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:43,870
just a handful of people in a room so

00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:47,410
anyway but there's there's one other

00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:49,270
point about that and that's when I was

00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:50,860
preparing for this that specifically

00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:53,260
this point I should I shared it to a

00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:55,390
friend and he told me a story so I'll

00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,910
just tell this little story his

00:37:55,390 --> 00:38:01,660
grandfather went to the Toyota plant in

00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:04,330
the 1970s and it was right after they

00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:06,880
had automated production and they had

00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:08,920
very quickly become sort of the envy of

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,960
the automobile production industry

00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:14,500
producing cars faster than anywhere else

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,870
with fewer defects during one hour the

00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:19,630
grandfather my friends grandfather asked

00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:21,610
one of the managers you know how can you

00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:24,370
do this with such consistency in speed

00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:28,870
and delivery and he said the defect

00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:31,720
lives in the human hand so if you remove

00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:34,660
the hand from the process that you

00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:37,810
remove the sorry remove the hand from

00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:40,660
the process and you get no defects and a

00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:44,170
lot of this applies to security as well

00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:46,840
so security problems are almost always

00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:49,960
defects in the system that are caused by

00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:52,810
human error eliminate the hand automate

00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:56,980
the process and you have secure superior

00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:59,080
security say obviously when you look up

00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:01,390
your own servers security is something

00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,710
you need to keep on top of and atras

00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:05,740
right we're never going to be as good as

00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:07,510
securities amazonas we don't need to be

00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,970
that good our environment is much

00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:11,590
simpler than amazon's and you know where

00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:13,930
the guys put it together we understand

00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:16,240
between us all of it because we built it

00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:18,430
and you know we can therefore control it

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,260
because we understand them so you know

00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:22,090
we know which port should be open which

00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,770
shouldn't be open we know which inputs

00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:26,710
we should accept which inputs we should

00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:29,430
reject we know where all our software

00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:32,710
came from we know how to keep up-to-date

00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:34,900
things like that and we do have an

00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:36,789
advantage and the advantages

00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:39,430
we have an issue we're not relying on

00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:41,680
anyone else or anyone elses time scales

00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:43,420
to get a result you know we because we

00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:48,430
put it all together we know how long it

00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:51,279
will take to put it back together okay

00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:56,230
love point for this panel is change in

00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:58,630
adoption so yeah change for us is work

00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:00,579
basically and but luckily as in the

00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:02,740
organization we don't have a lot of

00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:04,900
major change you know we're not add a

00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:06,730
shop we r you have product that we offer

00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,589
our products it's in these servers and

00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:10,029
for most of the time despite the

00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:13,390
security stuff we have to do they just

00:40:10,029 --> 00:40:15,190
get on with it so this is why self-help

00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:17,589
self-hosting may sense for us you know

00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:19,180
if we were exposed to a lot of change in

00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:25,900
our production environment i'd probably

00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:30,130
do something else again aaron i had a

00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:32,500
different order um well it's okay

00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:34,299
because i actually missed this slide

00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:37,329
apparently i just figured out that i

00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:40,680
didn't drive anything so I'll just wing

00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:43,690
it change is a process nobody wants to

00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:46,329
especially I would assume that everybody

00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:48,210
in this room has been working in the

00:40:46,329 --> 00:40:51,450
tech industry for a while and it's been

00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:55,299
building sites and doing things and you

00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:57,279
all know how to do it at some level well

00:40:55,299 --> 00:41:00,010
I assume most people know how to do it

00:40:57,279 --> 00:41:02,529
at some level and the way you know how

00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:05,470
to do it works so every time that you

00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:07,510
talk about changing the process and

00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:10,809
adopting a new process that's something

00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:12,940
that we as as people human beings we

00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:14,380
just shy away from especially when it's

00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,210
being implemented from somebody

00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:19,420
somewhere that doesn't really would know

00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:21,250
what's going on but again if you have a

00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:23,319
good system hopefully it's been built in

00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:25,569
a way that the learning curve is going

00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:31,720
to be to your benefit rather than to

00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:34,420
your detriment okay yeah so I mean in

00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:38,920
terms of like change in disruption to

00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:40,630
your organization moving it depends on

00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,839
the on the knowledge it it kind of

00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:46,430
circles back a little bit to UX and a

00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:49,250
little bit to skill sharing as well

00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:52,430
for sure you know with the services that

00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:54,410
we offer it's harder for an organization

00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:56,930
to adopt those services with with no

00:41:54,410 --> 00:42:00,650
linux knowledge or with little linux

00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:03,950
knowledge but obviously we provide

00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:05,480
training and help and tools to make

00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:08,000
things as smooth and as easy as possible

00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,220
now the whole purpose of us doing what

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,809
we do is to try and give you flexibility

00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:14,180
and freedom of architecture with as

00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:17,690
little pain as possible in terms of the

00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:21,500
learning curve for your people and in my

00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:24,559
opinion this point shouldn't be a

00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:26,599
barrier if you're coming and are about

00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:30,200
whether to go platform will manage door

00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:33,319
self-hosted because at the end of the

00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:36,260
day in my opinion the the freedom and

00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:40,550
flexibility to run your own software

00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:42,890
your own hardware and and call the call

00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:45,730
the shots train up your staff etc etc I

00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:48,200
think they I think they outweigh

00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:50,030
potentially any sort of training issues

00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,849
you might have all the issues getting

00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:55,880
people up to speed and with the support

00:42:52,849 --> 00:42:58,040
of a good management company overseeing

00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,990
that for you that doesn't need to be

00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:04,010
something that scares you away from

00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:06,170
potentially running your own layout so

00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:08,450
yeah I would say for sure the learning

00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:11,329
curve can't be helped this is this is

00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:14,540
not amateur stuff this is you know

00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:17,059
serious setting up of scary layouts will

00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:18,530
do most of the work for you but at a

00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:20,059
certain point you'll probably need to

00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:22,609
and want to engage with it and

00:43:20,059 --> 00:43:27,500
understand it yourselves and we'll help

00:43:22,609 --> 00:43:31,069
you do that ok I'm going to allow two

00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:32,869
guys a brief moment to conclude their

00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:36,589
arguments and then we're over to you

00:43:32,869 --> 00:43:38,390
work for any questions so I'm going to

00:43:36,589 --> 00:43:40,520
say that most people probably shouldn't

00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:42,200
self post and

00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,480
just like I said so far you need the

00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:47,300
right team you need a decent connection

00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,830
somewhere to put your servers you need

00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:51,620
the ability to predict your load or

00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:53,480
react fast enough to changes in load you

00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:56,930
mean you need the skills to build and

00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,310
protect your environment so you know

00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:00,530
it's a good fit for us because we have

00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:03,230
these things but you know that may not

00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:04,310
always be the case and you know if you

00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:06,230
want to find out if it's the right thing

00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:07,730
for you I'll see you affect any more if

00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:16,990
you're Arya tech team sit down have a

00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:19,010
thing okay so yeah I I wouldn't kind of

00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:22,910
thumb the tub for any particular

00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:24,350
approach myself it's not for no reason

00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:27,230
that we comfortably partner with a

00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:30,890
platform provider at the end of the day

00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:33,710
I think that choosing a hosting approach

00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:37,220
and a hosting product is a very

00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:39,620
individual for every business I hope

00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:43,640
that you've got a bit of insight some of

00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:48,800
the vectors involved in that for us you

00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:50,990
know we we try very much to to help

00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,370
customers choose the right approach when

00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:56,030
they come to us and it might not be

00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:57,680
managed service we've got some customers

00:44:56,030 --> 00:45:00,440
that start out managed and then end up

00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,850
in house like like rue and we've got

00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,590
some people that we just say look you're

00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:08,690
a perfect fit for a platform you know so

00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:10,640
it depends massively at the end of the

00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:12,470
day we just want to support Drupal based

00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,360
companies to make smart decisions about

00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:16,940
how they do their hosting and where they

00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:22,160
do their hosting and get the best deal

00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:25,310
for the people that we work with how did

00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:29,060
you say that thump the tub I will thump

00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:33,110
the tub platform as a service or nothing

00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:35,510
no actually I'm just joking um there are

00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:36,980
individual cases there are there are you

00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:39,350
you should be making the right decision

00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:42,340
for your clients I I do stand one

00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:45,610
hundred percent by I think platforms are

00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:49,190
more flexible they're they're they're

00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:50,860
very good value offering and but they're

00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:53,200
not the right fit

00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:56,020
for every single use case I will accept

00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:59,080
that and and I will even promote that

00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:02,470
just something to write it down nope and

00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:07,780
we know this isn't being recorded but oh

00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:09,960
wait it is yeah but i'll conclude on

00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:13,270
this and this is this is the last bit of

00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:15,910
platforms feel for you as a Drupal

00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:19,720
service provider we see that there are

00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:23,080
three primary ways to increase your

00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:27,580
bottom line right you can produce more

00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:29,860
Drupal you can what you can produce more

00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:32,920
Drupal for example by getting more

00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:35,080
contracts or bigger contracts you can

00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,430
increase your services or the scope of

00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:41,890
your services and what you're offering

00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:45,700
and or the third would be to reduce your

00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:49,270
costs right and in my opinion if you're

00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:51,700
using a good platform you should be able

00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:53,710
to do all three right you should have a

00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:56,440
more competitive advantage that allows

00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:59,500
you to produce more and win bigger

00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:02,020
contracts you shouldn't have to add

00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:06,310
people so therefore you should be able

00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:07,810
to reduce your costs and also if your

00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:10,180
partner with a good pause provider you

00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:12,190
can increase the scope you can you know

00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:14,860
become resellers or add hosting as an

00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:16,480
offering something that you're using to

00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:20,710
generate revenue for your business as

00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:23,070
well so that would be the last statement

00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:25,360
I'd say is personnel and a good platform

00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:28,630
increase the efficiency of the

00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:34,920
development process allowing you to

00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:34,920
create more faster and with less people

00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:41,290
okay well thank you Rupert Greg and

00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:43,150
Aaron it's been a good insight we've got

00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:45,840
a mic over there if anybody like to come

00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:48,400
up and present questions to the panel

00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,540
I'll shy for this one back as well I'll

00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,120
keep it

00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:55,990
I knew when John walked in the room the

00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:57,760
first question would be from him hi okay

00:47:55,990 --> 00:48:00,250
answer this is hard to answer but I'm

00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:04,570
looking for a finger in the air capex

00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:07,950
and opex on 100,000 hits a month and a

00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:11,530
million hits a month go each time you oh

00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:13,360
god I don't know what's the size of you

00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:15,310
how do you anonymous traffic

00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,410
authenticated traffic what are we doing

00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:19,540
it this is finger in the air but it's

00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:21,040
triple so you can assume this Sam

00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:27,190
authenticated traffic but I'm assuming

00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:30,670
it's not normally not much yeah sorry I

00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:32,040
know you've just so yeah just just to

00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:34,360
get just to understand that so

00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:36,910
essentially what you're saying is you

00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:40,240
know what what what would it cost are

00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:41,920
you asking us what it would cost to to

00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,510
take the various approaches to host a

00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,550
small website in a big website basically

00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:47,230
is that that's the question you yeah so

00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:51,040
to define this really clearly a

00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:53,440
challenge for business is that the costs

00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,940
are not defined and I'm not saying they

00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,950
can be very well because I've tried

00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:00,700
myself you know this is admin five years

00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:03,160
ago but what would be what is good is to

00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:05,230
kind of see your reasoning on your

00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,330
finger in the air kind of costs behind

00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:09,460
what it takes to do small site hundred

00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:11,710
thousand a month you know medium site

00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:13,660
million a month hosting so think about

00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:15,730
it in isolation so you've got to set up

00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:18,070
all because it's got to be separated

00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:20,710
from everything else so in isolation if

00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:22,480
I come to you and I say I'm getting I've

00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:24,520
got Drupal I've got a hundred thousand

00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:28,090
hits a month what price to give me as a

00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:31,060
fixed cost yeah yeah nets and that's

00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:32,470
that's some capex and opex yeah of

00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:33,940
course the first question I'd ask you is

00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:37,720
well as high availability important to

00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:40,660
you well you know on a million hits a

00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:42,490
hits a month I assume it is you know how

00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:44,530
many hits am I losing in my downtime so

00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:46,540
I guess that's something that I would

00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:50,490
probably ask you you know if I'm not

00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:52,540
technical but you know there's still

00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:57,310
well I guess what i want to highlight

00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:59,590
here is that you know that the reasoning

00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:00,630
is important and how close you can give

00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:02,880
me an answer

00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:05,340
this is important as a business not just

00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,870
want the prices but but having some

00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:08,220
certainty around it well I think that's

00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,660
the whole difficulty with the question

00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:11,820
because like you know you say you're

00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:13,860
talking about a hundred thousand visits

00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:15,780
a month website right yeah but if that's

00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:19,410
absolutely business-critical we might

00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:23,700
run that on six servers if that's just

00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:25,080
like a front-end shop window for a busy

00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:28,770
corporate site we might run it on a

00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:30,030
single VM and it'll be fine so it's

00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:33,300
difficult to say it could be anything

00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:35,910
from you know like literally like 300

00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:38,220
pounds a month up to why don't we simple

00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:39,900
hello let's let's say a hundred thousand

00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:42,660
on a brochure aside a million on a

00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:46,430
commerce site sounds good to me yeah

00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:49,620
okay yeah so I mean yeah I would say

00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:51,410
assuming we're providing a server as

00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:54,320
well you probably be talking about

00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:59,850
probably around about 200 pounds a month

00:50:54,320 --> 00:51:02,370
for the hundred thousand approach for

00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:04,830
the minyan I don't know very finger in

00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:07,500
the air I don't know probably about a

00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:13,910
thousand pounds month something like

00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:16,560
that okay so I I don't know like the

00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:18,090
size of the side obviously so let's just

00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,890
just for sake of argument will assume

00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:22,770
that it's not very data-intensive

00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:26,100
doesn't need a massive database 100,000

00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:29,760
hits we could handle that for fifty

00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:32,610
dollars a month million site million

00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:35,090
hits with a high availability system

00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:38,190
that has multiple data centers

00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:41,130
self-replicate able a replicable would

00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:43,440
be about starting point I think and I'm

00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:45,360
just assuming but I think you could set

00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,630
it up for around five hundred and sixty

00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:50,299
four dollars a month got it and i would

00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:54,259
say we're not hosting company

00:51:50,299 --> 00:51:56,569
I think I think the interesting point

00:51:54,259 --> 00:51:58,099
about this is that and is it is it does

00:51:56,569 --> 00:52:00,319
raise an interesting point which is that

00:51:58,099 --> 00:52:02,959
if you're talking about single

00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:04,869
individual websites platform probably

00:52:02,959 --> 00:52:09,199
will normally be more cost effective

00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:12,019
because the economies of scale planners

00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:15,679
start to make it cheaper per site if

00:52:12,019 --> 00:52:18,229
you're running multiple sites on a set

00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:19,999
of infrastructure right so then managed

00:52:18,229 --> 00:52:22,069
services come into comes into play

00:52:19,999 --> 00:52:24,529
you've got a whole lot of separated out

00:52:22,069 --> 00:52:26,630
properties for one organization and you

00:52:24,529 --> 00:52:28,579
need to hire salay whether they can call

00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:31,279
in any time of day against any of those

00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:36,140
properties right okay great question

00:52:31,279 --> 00:52:44,359
thanks John everybody else do we have

00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:53,619
any other questions oh you're sings a

00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:53,619
winner yeah you don't want to see that

00:52:54,099 --> 00:52:58,640
all right well if there aren't any other

00:52:56,630 --> 00:53:00,979
questions thank you all very much for

00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:04,699
