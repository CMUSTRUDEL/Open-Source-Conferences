Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: ASSURING QUALITY ON DRUPAL.ORG
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	Last year a group of us from the Git migration began writing automated tests for version control on Drupal.org. Our scratch-your-own-itch initiative quickly evolved, culminating in a suite of functional tests using Behat and Mink that encompass the entire site.

As we identified and documented over 675 scenarios, we learned a lot about the web site and are using that knowledge to support the upgrade to Drupal 7. But Behavior-Driven Development and its testing tools are about so much more than test automation. Quality begins long before code, long before even specification.

Using this new functional testing framework as a starting point, let's take a good long look at our human processes and consider how the community can continue to contribute effectively to the growth of Drupal.org.

Let's consider efficiency, not the extract-all-value-from-the-workers kind, but a graceful workflow where we develop the very best collaborative infrastructure we can while we continue to learn from and enjoy our labor.

We'll look at this in three sections:

Past
* A brief history of the test suite development
* A concise but detailed analysis of how the tests are used and maintained
* An analysis of past and current processes: decision-making, communication, and technical

Present
* areas of strength
* critical opportunities for improvement

Future
* Learn how to get involved with ongoing efforts
* Identify concrete next steps regarding improvements

welcome so it's a little bit after 215

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:07,340
so we're going to go ahead and get

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,690
started with the presentation today

00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,639
which will follow pretty closely the

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,799
outline that we had on the program which

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,830
is about assuring quality on drupal.org

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,720
so it'd be a little bit of history about

00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:21,210
testing i'm going to talk for I hope not

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,560
more than 10 minutes and then we're

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,510
going to split into a couple of groups

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,340
and so I'll tell you about that most of

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:33,149
this should be conversation on some very

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:36,149
specific topics so to get started what

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:38,940
we did way back when is worked on be had

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:41,550
tests for drupal org and so this is just

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,050
if you've never seen what B hat does it

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:47,700
allows you to describe functionality in

00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:50,129
relatively stylized but plain language

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,620
that project managers and product owners

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:54,989
can read and then turn them into

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,600
executable tests either using a browser

00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,809
or using a headless browser so that's

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,870
the basic concept and the reason that we

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:06,659
started this project at all is that Sam

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,790
and Howard and I along with a lot of

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,580
other people worked on the get migration

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,850
and a big part of what we spent hours

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:17,640
and hours doing was making sure every

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,680
time we integrated code that things were

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,960
still working and we did all of that

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,640
manually and it was pretty much me and

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,320
Sam and then opening it up to other

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,110
people to repeat the work that we've

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,619
done and neither of us ever wanted to do

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,750
that again in our lives so this was

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,979
something to learn to allow us to focus

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:40,110
on other functionality so this testing

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,670
project had a fairly long history and

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,220
we've had a lot of people who've been

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,470
really supportive of the process we

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,520
started it off long after the get

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,590
migration in April of 2012 as a

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,329
volunteer project with just some of us

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:59,340
from the get team who wanted to do the

00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:02,189
testing it we actually received the

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,280
donation of six months of developer time

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:07,079
from capgemini for three developers they

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,750
were available to the community to

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,060
participate in something and they landed

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,330
with us and so we did a lot of learning

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,750
in the process about be

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:18,820
tests we wrote features and automated

00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,320
them for the drupal 6 version and one of

00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,400
the things that we learned and that

00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,370
we're going to talk about more is that

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,780
actually no one person had any idea what

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,510
all of the functionality of drupal.org

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,610
was more than that they didn't know who

00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,800
had the permission to change that

00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:36,700
functionality in the process of moving

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,130
from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 so it was a

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,740
question of having four of us really in

00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:43,720
and a few other people look at Drupal 6

00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:47,320
and describe what it did whether that

00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,510
was right or not and then get that stuff

00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,390
automated and as the Drupal 7 site

00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,310
became more available to then apply

00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:57,700
those tests to Drupal 7 and where they

00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:59,530
didn't work anymore update them so we

00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,140
did that and we worked on them until

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,420
about September of 2012 for Drupal 6 and

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,280
then 7 was announced to be imminent at

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,680
that time so we took all of our effort

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,430
and put it into porting the test to

00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,640
Drupal 7 we completely abandoned working

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,410
on any of the Drupal 6 testing in

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:22,720
January and only lightly worked on the

00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:25,690
Drupal 7 tests so in the last couple of

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,670
months funded by the triple association

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,130
I've been making sure that those tests

00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,110
are reliable and robust and functional

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,959
in order to support the d7 upgrade among

00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,190
other QA tasks for the d7 upgrade so

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,780
these are some of the people who worked

00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,489
on it Jonathan hedstrom who's the author

00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,410
of the Drupal extension which came out

00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:44,650
of this project that's an extension to

00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:47,019
the testing tools themselves folks from

00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,660
capgemini and folks from a company

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,680
called QED 42 who are helping now so

00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,600
these are all people who've been

00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,220
involved in the effort and it's

00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,110
currently back to a volunteer-driven

00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,320
effort so it's kind of the history of

00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:01,120
the testing the scope of the test is

00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:06,370
that we were able to describe and

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:09,190
automate 139 features with 781 scenarios

00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:12,130
and over 4,000 steps that it clicks

00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,810
through on the site we have a lot of

00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,299
reliability if I'd say they're about

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,890
ninety-five percent reliable and there

00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:21,910
are some of them where environment

00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:23,680
issues make them not as reliable as we'd

00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,220
like in there's room for improvement but

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,530
we have a ton of

00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,270
us that let us know that the upgrade is

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:32,330
succeeding that things are working as

00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:35,110
they're expected to so if you're ever

00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:36,890
interested in poking around

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,870
understanding there's a lot of learning

00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,450
that went on in this process you can

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,100
take a look at the URL here and they'll

00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,440
post the slides for beauty test

00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,690
drupal.org and what you'll get if you go

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,340
into that folder is all of the output

00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,590
and you can just see what it does and

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,540
since it's in English like as long as

00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,740
you're an English speaker you can tell

00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,630
what it does without actually having to

00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,740
read the code you'd be able to walk

00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,920
through and say yeah that's what that

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,810
feature is supposed to do but the thing

00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,850
that is really important to us is that

00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:07,220
behavior driven development isn't really

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,050
actually even about automated testing

00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,260
like we use it synonymously with

00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:15,710
automated tests they're only a byproduct

00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:18,230
of a much larger philosophy so the real

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,870
goal of behavior driven development at

00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:25,340
the end of the day is to build software

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:29,330
that provides value and the tests are a

00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:30,919
byproduct of that so what happens is you

00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,750
end up describing you go through a

00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:34,640
process that philosophically says the

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,960
whole team should have a ubiquitous

00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,730
language for talking about what your

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,490
website does you should have a

00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:42,430
measurable identifiable value that every

00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,960
feature on your website provides and

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,450
that you should take every opportunity

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,919
to reduce your ignorance in the course

00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,900
of a project like those are the three

00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:53,000
main pillars of behavior driven

00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,400
development that our greatest constraint

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,530
is what we don't know and in some cases

00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,380
I think that that's true I do sometimes

00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:02,000
wonder with drupal org whether it's what

00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,880
we don't know or whether it's something

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,169
a little bit more systemic than that so

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,060
in the process of trying to maintain

00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:11,510
these tests and support the upgrade

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:14,120
we've identified three process and/or

00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:16,640
technical areas that make it really

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,040
difficult to do quality work they take a

00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,680
lot more effort on the part of staff and

00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,870
volunteers than they really should and

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,700
they start with things like we really

00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,260
don't have clear priorities regarding

00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:30,020
the business value of features on the

00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:33,020
site it is very difficult to know that

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:35,680
and it's something that we're going to

00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:39,030
talk about in the smaller groups today

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,220
this is more technical but it is also

00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,170
test to get there we do not have a fully

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,120
function of a functionally complete

00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:50,340
replica of the production environment

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:53,220
anywhere not for developing not for

00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:55,230
integrating not for staging work we're

00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,200
getting in for Drupal 6 this is

00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:01,200
definitely true we have a fairly close

00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:04,500
environment on on Drupal for Drupal 7

00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:07,380
when it launches so that's a problem in

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,970
terms of doing QA like you can't run

00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,340
your tests against a version of the site

00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,500
and see that it works so that's an issue

00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,570
and then finally and this one's really

00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,420
important to me as well we have only

00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:20,220
murky visibility into where work is at

00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,380
any time in the system so there's a

00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,990
thing there's some code somebody wants

00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,850
that code to get deployed some day how

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,180
close is it to getting their wares it

00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:31,350
which issue queue is it it's tagged but

00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,320
and we get into this thing where we

00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:36,720
don't have strong enough process to know

00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,370
that something is struggling or that

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,620
it's ready and it's waiting for review

00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,300
it the system that we use for core like

00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,750
to move things through that process is

00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:47,490
it a really work for the drupal.org

00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,810
process and getting things out there so

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,780
these are three areas that we're going

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,920
to talk about today I had mentioned on

00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,680
the right up that we would do some

00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,840
analysis of past and present processes

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,970
and I did a lot of talking to people and

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,250
looking at things in the past and I

00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,410
think that these three URLs are fine to

00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:07,350
review in your own time what I what I

00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,610
took away from that is that all of the

00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,850
things that have happened in the past

00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:14,940
are are not necessarily informative in

00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:16,740
the sense that they were people doing

00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,830
the very best they could with limited

00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,300
resources and so we do know that we want

00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,580
to improve that process and I think

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,830
focusing on these three areas moving

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,450
forward is the most constructive youth

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,560
that we can make of this hour but if

00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:31,320
you're interested in how it has been

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:35,010
there are links here that will let you

00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,750
know our areas of strength presently are

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,630
that we actually do have a governance

00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,040
structure moving into place so we have

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,560
that nearly complete staging environment

00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,300
for Drupal 7 and it's huge in terms of

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,730
being able to say we feel confident

00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,890
about doing an upgrade to Drupal 7 I

00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:52,500
don't know where we would be if we were

00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:55,530
where we were like three years ago

00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:58,560
and we have a more clearly articulated

00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:00,300
decision-making process and empowerment

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,640
for both our current work and our future

00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,650
process so at this point in time Neil

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,210
gets the double-wide picture because

00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,980
Neal's the one who is really empowered

00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,870
to make a lot of decisions that even a

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,930
year ago no one felt like they could

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:15,540
clearly make he's also a member of the

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:18,900
drupal org software working group along

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:21,330
with angie byron tatiana me and kim

00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,610
pepper so the five of us are going to be

00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,830
stepping into a role with a charter and

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,690
we have some specific duties that the

00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:30,450
bottom i'll give you a link to the full

00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:32,490
charter if you want to check it out but

00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,830
they fit actually these areas where we

00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,380
really need improvement so one of that

00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:39,240
is team leadership the working group is

00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,910
to create and remove teams for each

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,830
major area of the websites and have the

00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,420
authority to make software and feature

00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,660
decisions within the scope so those

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,980
teams will be empowered in their areas

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,020
defining and appointing leadership roles

00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,900
technical lead product owner that's a

00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:58,620
thing and that's about having the

00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:00,089
decision making process clarified one of

00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,610
the things we just recently went through

00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:05,640
was the ideation process we did a very

00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:08,490
short quick kind of temperature check

00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,080
and we got a very clear temperature

00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,290
check that there are some pain points

00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,050
right now with drupal org but the idea

00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:19,230
is to do a good job and a better job

00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:21,450
maybe of understanding the needs of the

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:24,300
target audiences and so the process has

00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:25,620
been open an issue a bunch of people put

00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,839
a bunch of opinions we did it this time

00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,870
kind of the way we did over almost two

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,030
years ago we don't have a way of taking

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,070
that information and acting on it in a

00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:38,610
regular manner so that's another thing

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:41,010
to talk about today and then finally in

00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,660
the development and maintenance and that

00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,330
responsibility for the working group

00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:47,820
things like identifying i'm pretty sure

00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:50,670
that a community the size of drupal and

00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,750
a site the size of drupal org should

00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,490
have a complete staging environment

00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,170
we're feeling pretty comfortable that

00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:58,350
that would be a step forward and we want

00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,880
to make progress in that area as well so

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,040
these are all things within the Charter

00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,330
that we are trying out the process

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,769
saying well we're empowered to do this

00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,929
so let's get moving on

00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:08,850
doing this and the full charter is

00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:10,709
visible there and you can get it from

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,149
the slides when they get posted as well

00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:13,499
so if you're interested and there are

00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:14,879
many other working groups that are

00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:18,269
having conversations during this

00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:20,429
conference so these critical areas of

00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:22,829
improvement ideation how do we collect

00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:26,459
and prioritize website features for

00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:28,410
appropriate audiences environments where

00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:30,360
do we develop and evaluate code and

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,309
visibility how do we track work in the

00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,019
system are the three things that I want

00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:36,239
to turn it over to people to talk about

00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,529
in groups because they we won't get

00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:41,189
through all three of them as a single

00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:43,470
group today one of the things that I

00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:44,939
will do a really quick run through of

00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,850
and we can choose if we want to spend

00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:50,670
time with it or not is that we need to

00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,819
do some review of work and we need to

00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:55,019
talk about what stages it moves through

00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:56,699
once we decide that there's a good idea

00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:58,619
out there which is not what this

00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:01,649
addresses but once we say hey here's

00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:03,540
work it needs to be done needs to be

00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:06,299
implemented move through QA to

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,040
deployment so we need some checks and

00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:10,100
this is where those teams come in and

00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,869
the team leadership comes in as well and

00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,269
I've been trying to explain super

00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:18,809
clearly the in the past we've expected

00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:20,639
volunteers to hunt down people to

00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:22,829
provide them with feedback and what I

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,009
feel like we need to switch to is a

00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:28,679
supportive model that is meant to enable

00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:31,559
and promote motion not to throttle and

00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:33,119
not to bottleneck at the end point of

00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:34,799
that like right before you deploy if

00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:37,559
it's not performing it's not going on

00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,600
the site like it can't but in the early

00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:41,999
stages getting the right feedback at the

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,519
right time can help people save time and

00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:46,379
shape their projects so these reviews

00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,919
are the things that ultimately any

00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:52,110
change to drupal org has to be okay we

00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,869
need to know that the UI and the UX is

00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:57,360
reasonably consistent we need to know

00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:59,249
that the code is maintainable which in

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,739
an early part when you don't even have

00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:03,089
code may be difficult to do but if

00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,619
someone looks at it says oh you know if

00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:06,089
you're going to plan to use that module

00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:07,350
that module hasn't been maintained for a

00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:09,360
year you're probably not going to want

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:11,730
to do that it can save them having to

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,860
recode later so it's a supportive check

00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:16,559
not a prove to me that all your plans

00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,520
are going to be secure right social

00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:19,800
maintenance are the feature

00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,530
that are being introduced going to

00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,570
require someone to monitor spam to make

00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:26,160
sure content is flowing we need to know

00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,250
about that and think about it when we

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,530
consider something for deployment test

00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,600
plans which do not have to be B hat

00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:35,640
tests initially in my opinion and this

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,260
is all proposal but which we really do

00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,720
need you to like if somebody's proposing

00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:42,990
a feature to tell us how we know it's

00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,180
working if we've never seen it before so

00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,860
that's a component that you would need

00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,450
to think about it deployment time and

00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,580
then performance as security and

00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:53,430
coordination with other site or feature

00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,260
maintain errs as needed so having these

00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,630
checks and getting people in place to

00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:00,030
really make this happen is one of the

00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:02,070
things that will be working on as well

00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:03,960
as moving things through a process where

00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:06,600
there is an implementation plan so again

00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:10,080
that this is separate but connected to

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,370
the this is a good idea so that you have

00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,050
some idea this is what we're going to do

00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,270
and people can talk about it it's a lot

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,530
like a request for comment period where

00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,690
you've given people enough to sort of

00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:20,670
bat around the ideas on an

00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,680
implementation level so the idea has

00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,480
been vetted but not how you're going to

00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,270
actually implement it where it would

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,670
move visibly by setting an issue or a

00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:31,260
field on a content type 2 under

00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,730
development where it would be developed

00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,590
in the modules and places where it

00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,600
belongs so it's it's a tracking issue

00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,880
for getting things out there where it

00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,870
would be reviewed for deployment

00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,540
integrated with any other code for

00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:44,070
deployment go to stage get deployed and

00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,600
obviously it would iterate in any of

00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:48,270
these places where there are issues with

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,040
things like performance so what we're

00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,480
planning as the software working group

00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,910
and people who do a lot of work on

00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,880
drupal org is to try this process out

00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:59,910
with three of the ideas that came out of

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,530
that recent idea process bat that around

00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,360
intellectually work with through those

00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:05,580
processes see what doesn't make sense

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,200
and I'm feeling like we have a pretty

00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:10,110
good handle on it but I would love if

00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,790
this looks like not possible didn't

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,960
think this through I can already tell

00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,340
you there's going to be a problem we'd

00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,650
love to have that conversation with

00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,750
people during this time I know we'll

00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:22,530
adjust it before we say this is the

00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:24,900
process so that's knowing where work is

00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:26,430
in the system which is really important

00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,420
to predicting when work is going to get

00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,950
deployed and be available to users

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,620
so you feel like we're getting some

00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,540
concrete progress on that and what I'd

00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,490
like to do is take a couple of any

00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:39,760
clarifying questions that you have and

00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:43,510
split into two or it's up to you three

00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,310
groups so the conversation will go like

00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:48,339
this salmon Howard who are right here

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:49,990
you guys can yet so Sam and Howard along

00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:52,209
with Neil and Rudy and they're a bunch

00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:55,089
of people who are prepared to take a

00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:58,060
very concrete step about environments

00:15:55,089 --> 00:16:00,250
and the other folks can come with me and

00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,290
we can talk about process like how do we

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,750
surface good ideas how do we get more

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,190
voices involved or we can talk about

00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,600
that other process how do we make work

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:12,699
visible in the pipeline we're going to

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:16,600
do that for 30 minutes yes there will

00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:18,550
yes so ensure that you have a note

00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,529
keeper and a presenter to summarize the

00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,600
outcome of your conversation in one of

00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:24,160
those two groups so if environment

00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,720
people want to go on this side anybody

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,180
who wants to talk process can come over

00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,649
here with me and we can talk about it

00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:33,399
these are the questions that I'm hoping

00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:35,589
to focus us on environment people the

00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:38,170
very first next step to that staging

00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:41,529
server that I dream of is actually doing

00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:44,110
what components of production need to be

00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:45,850
on a staging server identifying them all

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:48,250
in order to turn that into a work plan

00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:49,720
and if you knock that out in the first

00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,149
five minutes there's just a couple of

00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,339
follow-up pieces so if you have that

00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:55,990
this is what's on production is all of

00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:57,940
it necessary for stage or what's

00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,800
different between stage and prod and

00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,540
then going backward to the development

00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,610
environment trying to get that complete

00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,530
replica anybody who's interested in

00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,790
talking about process I'm going to talk

00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:09,030
about how we can best engage

00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:11,380
stakeholders to assess their needs a

00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:13,089
kind of frequency and timeline that

00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,740
might be involved and then we can circle

00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:16,270
back around to how do we build review

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,220
teams to ensure that we're getting the

00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:21,819
feedback to people at the right point in

00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:24,540
time in the development process so we

00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:27,010
can have that conversation and if we get

00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:29,169
question number one components of the

00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,850
production environment out I agree to

00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:31,480
make a huge step forward so I'm really

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,700
excited

00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,080
doing that so go ahead and join them if

00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,910
you want to talk about environments you

00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,650
want to talk about process come over

00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:42,059
here and chat with me and I'll keep

00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,059
