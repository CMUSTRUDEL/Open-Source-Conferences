Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: DRUPAL CHEF: BORK BORK BORK!
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	Opscode Chef is an open source systems integration framework, meant to reduce "one off" server building, allowing scalable architecture to be easily replicated, but also to allowing you to keep development, staging and production boxes in sync.. You write (and/or seek out) basic recipes to describe how you want each part of your infrastructure to be built. We'll discuss using Chef in a Drupal context.

Starting from scratch with simple server concepts like a fully managed LAMP stack, we'll add in Drupal installation, Drush, and so on.

We'll then bring in options like Jenkins, Behat, logging, redundancy, and more... showing how all of these tools help to build stable environments that you know work and work well.

Humor, especially of a muppet variety, will be key to making this presentation bearable. Wakka Wakka!
