Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: WE NEED TO TEACH PEOPLE DRUPAL 8. NOW
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	Drupal 8 is just around the corner and there is a whole army of people that need to get trained on how to use it. Fast. For people that are not actively involved with core development it can be daunting to see Drupal 8 looming in the future. It's exciting because you've heard about all the shiny new features, and know that you'll be able to do some really great things with it. But that transition comes at a cost, you need to learn the system first and there's always a productivity penalty when learning new things. This ends up making it scary to take on new projects using Drupal 8 and ultimately impacts the rate of adoption.

Over the last few years I've spent a lot of time teaching people how to use Drupal via training videos, workshops, and on-site training for clients and I think that this provides some insight into how we can ease the learning curve a little this time around that I would like to share. And I believe this is a good opportunity to have a discussion about how we as a community can improve the available training materials and more rapidly turn ourselves and the rest of the Drupal using world into Drupal 8 ninjas.

Some of my ideas include

Providing good, well documented examples demonstrating this is how it was in Drupal 7, and this is how it is now in Drupal 8. Allow people to build on the knowledge they already have so they don't feel like they are starting over.

Figure out how to teach the "why" of Drupal 8, not just the how. Learning how to work with the new CMI API via the documentation and copying some examples so that you can add some config variables to your module is just part of what we need people to understand. We also need to teach them why CMI, why it was architected this way, what decisions were made along the way, etc. If we want to see people make the most of the tools we're providing them they need to be able to know when it's the right tool for a problem that we haven't even dreamt up yet. And without the why those kinds of discoveries are difficult.

I can also talk about what I see as being some of the bigger learning hurdles for Drupal 8 so that we can start to come up with ideas for how to help people over those gaps.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
all right I'm gonna go ahead and get

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,569
started cuz it is like one minute after

00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:11,700
five and we don't want to be late big

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:13,380
time so this session is about teaching

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,480
people Drupal 8 and the importance of

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,970
doing so in and kind of some of my ideas

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,470
about how we can do that and I'm being

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:29,279
told that it might help if the

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:32,820
microphone is closer is that better all

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:35,219
right cool um so yeah I'm gonna go ahead

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,350
with that we're gonna talk about why we

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,809
need to teach people Drupal 8 and why we

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,700
should start doing it right now and how

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,770
we can go some ideas about how we can go

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,010
about doing that a little bit of

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,200
background my name is Joe for those of

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,170
you that don't know me I work at lolla

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,510
bot and on the Drupal ëismí team I am

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,100
voj the brave on Twitter and IRC and

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,309
drupal.org and pretty much anything

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,050
internet-related this slide is hilarious

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,969
to me because ninety percent of the time

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,049
I put this slide into a presentation and

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,270
then I'm like yeah sweet i work for

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,770
these people this isn't relevant to what

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,180
I'm actually talking about but it's

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,220
really funny because this is like the

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,490
one time this slide is ever relevant

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,020
because at lolla bot I'm the lead

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,330
trainer for the Drupal eyes meet project

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,159
so I've had a lot of experience teaching

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,830
people Drupal and I've put a lot of time

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,509
and thought into thinking about sort of

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,390
ideas about how we can improve that

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,729
experience for those of you that don't

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,590
know me from drupal.org you might know

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,229
me because my face is plastered all over

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,790
these videos on Drupal eyes me and it's

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:39,240
kind of awkward our booth right now has

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,130
this video on repeat that has me talking

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,990
and then I'm like standing there it's

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:48,899
weird um anyways in this talk what I'd

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,610
like to do is I'd like to try to spend

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,710
about 15 to 20 minutes giving a

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,299
presentation about some of what I see is

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,619
the problems in this space right now and

00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,600
some of my ideas for how we could

00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,579
address those and then open it up for

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,290
discussion and the idea being that in

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,579
these core conversation tracks were able

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,759
to have a bit more of an open discussion

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:08,879
about these things so I want to talk

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,560
about why we're talking about this why

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,060
education is important and especially

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,640
now in sort of the point that we're

00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,230
in the Drupal 8 release cycle I'm going

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,180
to talk a little bit about the things

00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:22,810
that we are already doing in order to

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,920
help educate people about Drupal 8 i'm

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,810
going to talk a little bit about some

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,580
things that i think we could we could be

00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,959
doing that we're not or that we could be

00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:34,720
doing better i am going to present to

00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:38,200
you a idea that i have about ways that

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,959
we can leverage our the size of our

00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,620
community to help educate our community

00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,849
and then i'm gonna open it up for

00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,709
discussion and you're going to tell me

00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:51,160
how you're going to teach people drupal

00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:54,130
8 so to start out I think it's important

00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,100
to understand like why we're talking

00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:59,739
about educating people in Drupal 8 I

00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,459
think there's kind of the obvious right

00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:04,989
drupal aids right around the corner

00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,940
whatever however far away that corner is

00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:09,459
we are definitely going to round it at

00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,260
some point and at that point suddenly

00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:12,459
everyone's going to need to know Drupal

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,730
8 so that they can start building

00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:18,220
websites with it and if they if we're

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:21,609
not able to educate our community both

00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,769
site builders developers end users on

00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:25,570
how to use the software we're not going

00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:27,250
to see the level of adoption that we

00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,840
would like to withdrew blade like the

00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,540
number one reason we're talking about

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,280
this is because if people don't know how

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,180
to use Drupal 8 they're not going to be

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,819
able to build websites with Drupal 8 a

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:43,209
lot has changed between Drupal 7 and

00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:45,190
Drupal 8 I honestly don't know all the

00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:46,930
things that have changed I've read a lot

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,459
about various different things I've seen

00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,650
a lot of different statistics that try

00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,389
to represent it in numbers I think it's

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,239
just safe to say that there are some

00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:57,579
really really big changes between the

00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:59,260
way that we do things in Drupal 7 in the

00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:03,569
way that we're going to be doing them in

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:06,190
Drupal 8 and we've ended up in this

00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:08,380
currently in this space where I feel

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:11,799
like there's a unfortunately a lot of

00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:13,690
fear and doubt about Drupal 8 and about

00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,160
the amount of change I think we're

00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,019
seeing a lot of blog posts from people

00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,660
that are like oh my god everything

00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,909
changed you should be terrified and so a

00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,400
lot of people that aren't closely

00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:26,530
tracking what's going on in Drupal 8 and

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,510
really know like what that change means

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,070
all their hearing is Drupal 8 is

00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,870
seventy-six percent different than

00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,720
Drupal 7 and it's like well that's a

00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:37,930
terrifying number that means nothing to

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,030
me other than I should be scared and I

00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,620
think it's important for us to talk when

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,290
we talk about educating people about

00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,150
Drupal 8 to talk about that too and that

00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,190
fear and uncertainty kind of in our

00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,470
community right now because in order for

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,810
people to learn we need to provide them

00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,310
with a safe space to learn like people

00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,630
learn best when they're comfortable and

00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,190
when they're excited about the thing

00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,020
that they're going to learn not when

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,130
they're being forced to learn it against

00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,870
their own will and they have no interest

00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:06,490
in it finally I think that in this

00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,380
especially in the context of these core

00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,870
conversations there's a really large

00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,150
opportunity for people to get involved

00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,090
in the community by contributing to

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,800
helping educate people about Drupal 8

00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,150
this is one of those really cool

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,490
opportunities where you don't even have

00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:24,040
to write any code to help contribute to

00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:32,260
Drupal 8 so that's an exciting thing for

00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:34,300
me so we're already as a community doing

00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:37,180
a whole lot of things to try to help

00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,830
teach people about Drupal 8 and we're

00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,060
doing all of these really well but of

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,039
course we could be doing all of them

00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:46,150
even better than we're already doing

00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:47,950
them so most of you are probably

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,479
familiar with these resources already

00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,630
but we'll kind of just run through real

00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:55,300
quick api Drupal or gets our code

00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:57,400
documentation i would say that in most

00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,310
cases this is the number one place that

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,410
people go to learn about Drupal in

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,300
general i SPECT developers anyways this

00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:06,430
is the their number one resource for

00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,350
figuring out how to accomplish the thing

00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,450
that they need to do in Drupal this is

00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:12,310
true of Drupal 6 of Drupal 7 and this

00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,950
will be true of Drupal 8 so we need to

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:18,220
make sure that the documentation that we

00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:19,960
write in our code is awesome so that

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,450
when it gets parsed input on API

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,590
drupal.org people find that information

00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:28,270
and they can make use of it we're doing

00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,590
a pretty good job of that but it's

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,350
always one of those things that we could

00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,270
do better at and I think that's a good

00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,099
opportunity for people to help out and

00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,320
just keep improving that documentation

00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:39,190
improving those tools for discovering

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:44,290
the document

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:46,270
as well one of my favorite things that

00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:49,720
the community is started doing with

00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:51,040
Drupal 8 is these change notices so I

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,470
don't remember the process of upgrading

00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:56,230
a module from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 but

00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:58,930
you went to this page on drupal.org and

00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:00,700
scrolled for about six minutes and

00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,410
listed every single change between

00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,750
Drupal 6 in Drupal so I would except the

00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:06,400
ones that it didn't list and then you

00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:11,710
just did all of those things to your

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:15,760
module and tada worked in Drupal 7 it

00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:17,020
did I swear and it actually it worked

00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,760
really well because it provided a

00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,060
resource for people to go and find the

00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,890
things that had changed in Drupal 8 this

00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:28,300
is or sort of in the process of building

00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:30,190
Drupal 8 we've got new tools for dealing

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,310
with what are called change notices on

00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:35,290
drupal.org but basically the ability to

00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:37,060
log that this is the way it was done in

00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:39,310
Drupal 7 this is the way it's done in

00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,680
Drupal 8 or this is something that's new

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:43,780
in Drupal 8 but now they're they're not

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,419
all in one giant page they're searchable

00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:48,220
they a lot of them have really great

00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:51,130
examples it shows this is how you

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,900
implemented the hook in Drupal 7 this is

00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,840
how you implement it in Drupal 8 or

00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:59,169
whatever the equivalent is and provide a

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,690
resource for people who are already know

00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:03,790
Drupal 7 and are moving towards learning

00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,919
drupal 8 which at this point is probably

00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:09,190
a large part of the people we're talking

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,930
about trying to educate I'm the one

00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,460
thing that I struggle with with change

00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,200
notices and I think that we could work

00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:20,050
on doing a little bit better is making

00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:22,870
it more easier to find the ones that are

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:25,270
really valuable change notices at this

00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:28,570
point there's a few thousand of them

00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:30,280
probably and some of them are like we

00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,620
added a new routing system and here is

00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,120
how you use it and some of them are we

00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,219
changed the name of this function and

00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,589
both of those things are relevant and

00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:40,479
important but when I'm first learning

00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:44,380
drupal I want to find the ones that are

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,120
like this is the really big change if I

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,339
ever need to know that you change the

00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,580
name of that function I'll know because

00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:53,990
it won't work when I try to use it

00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,850
so I think something we could

00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,970
potentially do here is add some either

00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:03,560
some kind of like flag like this one's

00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:05,180
important says the community or document

00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,950
the changes a little bit more on

00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,020
drupal.org and then link to the change

00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:12,160
notices provide a little some kind of

00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,750
discoverability for these change notices

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:19,450
and so kind of running through this

00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:23,480
handbook is our non code documentation

00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:25,070
it's for me this is the place that I go

00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,580
when I want to learn a little bit more

00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:31,190
about why this decision was made or how

00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:33,620
this whole this system as a whole works

00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:37,760
versus how this one particular function

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:40,520
works again we're doing it it could

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,190
always be better I would say and also

00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,110
kind of right now I would say the API

00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:47,240
documentation is great the change

00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:50,540
notices are awesome the handbook

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:53,330
upgrades are coming along and getting

00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,980
there in addition to that there's also

00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,140
all kinds of content that doesn't live

00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,390
on drupal.org that were that people in

00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:02,960
the community are generating blog posts

00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:05,450
articles tutorials videos and that kind

00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,370
of stuff we're doing that and we should

00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:10,400
continue to do so I do have some ideas

00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,990
about how we can improve that and what

00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,730
really like when you're writing a blog

00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,740
post what should you be writing about

00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,380
and how could you make it useful for

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:21,200
educating people and then of course

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:23,270
things like this drupalcon and camps are

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,780
a really really good opportunity for us

00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:28,100
to very quickly educate a whole bunch of

00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,680
people about something because you've

00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,780
got a bunch of people in the room Larry

00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,630
Todd a session Larry and Robin had a

00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:37,760
session next door like an hour ago that

00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,050
had probably close to 200 people in the

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,330
room that we're learning to write a

00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:44,120
Drupal 8 module for the first time and

00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:47,150
that's awesome so I would like to talk

00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,340
about ways that we can leverage our

00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:52,070
camps and cons and our communities in

00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:55,790
order to more rapidly like disseminate

00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:57,500
that information I do a lot of video

00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,120
stuff and I get asked this question a

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,040
lot why aren't you doing more Drupal 8

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,630
videos and this is why we're not doing a

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,560
lot of Drupal 8 videos right now

00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:08,300
because videos are really hard to patch

00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,160
and so while I think they're important

00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,050
and we should continue to produce that

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,940
kind of material remembering that the

00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:16,310
educational material we're producing now

00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:20,000
is going to need to change and continue

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:23,150
to change until Drupal 8 is not changing

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,800
so rapidly so as if you're producing

00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:28,130
your own materials kind of keeping that

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:32,240
in mind so that's a bit about like what

00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:34,700
we're doing already so and then I want

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,940
to talk about some of my ideas about

00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:41,210
things that we could be doing but aren't

00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:43,250
really doing a ton of at the moment none

00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:44,870
of this is based on research so we may

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,120
actually be doing this and I just don't

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,460
know it but this has kind of been based

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,760
on my observations over the last six

00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:54,920
months or so I mentioned at the

00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,080
beginning that one of the important

00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,260
things we need to do is clear up this

00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:04,550
like concern about oh my god Drupal 8 is

00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:06,380
hard it's like more oh man drupal 8 is

00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,630
different than Drupal 7 yes you're right

00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:10,460
it is in Drupal 6 was different than or

00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:15,200
Drupal 7 would do different than Drupal

00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:17,000
6 and I think that you know the people

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,520
that attend these conferences the

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,950
leaders in our community we have a role

00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,830
in where we should be trying to build

00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:26,510
hype and energize people about Drupal we

00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:29,270
should be spending more time talking

00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:31,910
about not oh man this thing changed in

00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:33,860
Drupal 8 you're going to have to learn

00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:36,260
all this crazy new stuff we should be

00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,360
talking about yes this thing changed but

00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:42,530
if you learn this new stuff here's why

00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:45,200
it's going to be awesome for you so you

00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:47,240
know as a developer it's for the most

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,930
part I don't really care that it changed

00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:53,750
or I'm willing to figure out what

00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:57,350
changed and learn that new system if I

00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:59,480
know what the benefit is to me if I'm

00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:02,210
just relearning how to do the same thing

00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,790
that I already know how to do I better

00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:06,770
have a really good reason to do that and

00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:10,010
so you know there's all these examples

00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:12,260
with Drupal right the way that we bout

00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:14,089
code paths and stuff in the routing

00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,540
system in Drupal 8 is different than it

00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:17,360
was in two

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:19,160
people seven I think we need to be

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,100
educating people not only that yes it's

00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,200
different but why it's different and if

00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,000
they take the time to learn drupal 8 in

00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:30,650
this new system the benefits that

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,900
they're going to gain from using that so

00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:35,750
I think that you know are one of our

00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:38,240
roles should be to tell our community

00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,950
why we're excited about Drupal 8 and why

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,760
we're excited about these changes so

00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:46,640
that they get excited to learn them I

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:48,560
was thinking about for myself like you

00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,600
know six months ago or so trying to

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,010
figure out I know that I'm going to need

00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,650
to invest a lot of time in learning

00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:56,420
drupal 8 in the near future and to some

00:13:54,650 --> 00:14:02,060
extent I'm going to do it because I have

00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:04,130
to for my job for what I do but how do I

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,080
get excited about it and I kept thinking

00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:07,400
I'm really excited about all this other

00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,350
stuff that's going on like I kind of

00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,060
want to learn nodejs that sounds really

00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,070
cool I want to learn this other tool

00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:16,220
over here and I think that what was

00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:19,010
happening for me was I wasn't as excited

00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,450
about Drupal 8 because it or the amount

00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:22,520
of work that i would have to put into

00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,920
learning it because it felt like I was

00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,930
just having to spend a ton of time

00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:32,510
learning to do what I already knew how

00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:33,650
to do which is totally not the case but

00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,540
based on the things that I've been

00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,040
reading and kind of how I was feeling at

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,570
that time that's that's what I was

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,660
feeling and so I wanted to see more of

00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:43,760
like this hype and excitement and the if

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,500
you learn to do this thing here's why

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,360
it's going to be awesome for you if you

00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,040
learn how to use the new translation

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,740
system this is why it's going to make

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:56,300
your life easier so I think we could do

00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:58,190
a lot in that respect the other thing

00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:02,690
that i think i would like to see us do

00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:04,190
more of is talk a bit more about when

00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,770
we're teaching people talk a bit more

00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:10,490
about why things change and not just

00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:12,290
what changed we have a lull about has a

00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:15,320
company retreat once a year and at our

00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,940
previous our last retreat i spend some

00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,560
time just kind of talking to my

00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,900
co-workers who are all going to have to

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,720
learn drupal 8 like how are you how do

00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,790
you plan on learning drupal 8 what what

00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,370
can you know the people on the education

00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,380
department at la loba do to help you

00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:32,900
learn drupal a in the response that I

00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,610
kept getting was like you know I'll

00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,950
totally go read the API documentation

00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,720
I'm happy to do that and figure out how

00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:43,130
the functions work but I want to know

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:45,260
like I don't know what the new things

00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:47,240
are that I don't know about I don't know

00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,550
of the two new things which one I should

00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,500
choose and why and so a little bit more

00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,870
like painting the big picture for people

00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,670
about this is the system that's

00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:58,250
available and this is why you would

00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,779
choose using you can see I'm going to

00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,150
totally make things up this is why you

00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:05,600
would use a cue instead of a batch to do

00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:07,160
something and being able to explain

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,290
those things to people and I think a lot

00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,790
of developers in our community once

00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,310
they're convinced that this is the right

00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:15,589
system are totally capable of figuring

00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:19,550
out how to read the document the API

00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:21,440
documentation and especially if we can

00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,540
get away from that like oh my god

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,360
object-oriented programming it's like

00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:29,450
you figured out how to do the Drupal 7

00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,550
stuff I would my gut says that most

00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:35,089
people are going to be able to figure

00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,920
out the Drupal 8 stuff just fine but

00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:39,110
there is a lot of like uncertainty in

00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,940
our just because that gets bubbled up

00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:43,400
people get really excited about the like

00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:45,260
doubt in the in various blog posts and

00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,790
Twitter and stuff and it becomes a

00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:52,700
bigger discussion that it needs to be

00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:56,450
but I think that so lots of discussions

00:16:52,700 --> 00:17:01,370
about the Y aspect of it I think are

00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:03,230
going to be important I feel like we can

00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:06,890
build all these really cool tools in

00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:08,689
Drupal 8 for the community and we can

00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,490
teach them how to use them and we also

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:11,780
need to teach them the rules so that

00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,179
they can figure out how to break the

00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,250
rules like our community is going to

00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:18,439
build things with Drupal 8 that we can't

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:20,059
even fathom right now but they're not

00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:22,189
going to be able to do that until they

00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:23,689
first understand all of Drupal 8 and

00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:29,450
then can figure out how to push its

00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:32,120
limits another thing that we we are

00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,160
actually doing now but I think for me

00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,600
this is not a like let's just kind of

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,840
keep doing it in the background this is

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,630
like a let's get it done now is the

00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,890
examples project

00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:44,250
if you're not familiar with it the

00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:47,050
examples project on drupal.org contains

00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:50,050
example modules using various different

00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:53,440
core api's and like documentation about

00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:55,420
how to use those I think that for a

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,000
while it was fine for us to not update

00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:59,920
these because Drupal aids api's were

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,380
changing so rapidly and nobody wanted to

00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,940
maintain the examples project but now

00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:08,260
we're at this period where we're we're

00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:10,810
asking contribute a nurs to update their

00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:12,940
code we better provide them examples on

00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:14,260
how to use those things the other thing

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:18,880
that I think this will help with a lot

00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:20,950
is show of hands how many people in this

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:25,750
room could go and implement something

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:27,400
using batch API right now yeah how many

00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:30,190
people in this room could go and

00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,230
download the batch module example and

00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:35,020
copy and paste the example and change a

00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:36,790
couple things in the file yeah so and

00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,530
and you would probably learn a little

00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,510
bit about how that system works along

00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:49,090
the way so I think it's important for us

00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:51,400
to get these things up to date I know I

00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:53,320
certainly couldn't I think like half the

00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:59,280
things I do in Drupal 7 I copy and paste

00:18:53,320 --> 00:19:03,340
from the examples module it's amazing I

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,710
would like to see spent us spend some

00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,060
time looking at other communities that

00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,550
have also been through this type of

00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:12,250
change we are certainly not the first

00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:14,230
community that is introduced a oh my god

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,330
there's a ton of changes scenario and

00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:18,580
then had to figure out how to really

00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:20,440
quickly educate everyone in the

00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,900
community on what those new changes are

00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,330
and I would assume that there are

00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:28,630
opportunities to learn from others that

00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:30,910
have gone before us I have a one

00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:32,260
specific example of this that I found to

00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:37,000
be pretty interesting and so I'm going

00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:39,130
to share that my data may be a little

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,930
bit off because most of this is second

00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:44,530
hand information but the way that this

00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:46,960
works is my dad and my wife have both

00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:49,810
worked as nurses and healthcare agencies

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,690
at some point and a few years ago the US

00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:54,460
government mandated that all healthcare

00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:58,870
agencies switch to electronic

00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:00,490
medical records by sometime I I think it

00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:03,100
may still be some time in the future but

00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,690
they're all pretty rapidly changing and

00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,550
this was an interesting scenario where

00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:09,940
all of a sudden the whole bunch of

00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:12,070
people had to transition their knowledge

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:15,010
of how to keep medical records on paper

00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,720
to doing it on a computer it's still

00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,370
pretty much the exact same thing they're

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,840
logging the same information but it's a

00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:21,640
different tool for doing so and I think

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,860
there's some analogies between the

00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,770
Drupal 7 Drupal 8 there were you know

00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:28,480
we're asking people to relearn how to do

00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:31,780
a lot of the things that they already

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,370
know how to do but then when they switch

00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,650
to the computer they got all these

00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:37,090
additional benefits that they didn't

00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,800
even know they were going to get until

00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,180
they had made that transition the

00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,040
computer could do things like tab

00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,240
completion of their name so that they

00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,900
didn't have to write their name a

00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:49,120
hundred times a day this is a scenario

00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,760
where we're talking about thousands of

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,520
people having to leave work on Friday

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,260
and sign their name on a paper record

00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,330
and then show up on Monday and use it

00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:00,430
brand new system like this wasn't it

00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:02,890
like it's rolled out over time it was

00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:05,440
one day they had a new system they had

00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,850
to use and so I talked to both of them a

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,760
little bit about what that experience

00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:11,260
was like for them and how they how their

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,090
organizations kind of dealt with that

00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:18,160
and what they ended up doing in both

00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:19,570
cases was the company that produced the

00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,580
software that they were using in this

00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:25,660
case called epic well at both places

00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:28,780
actually came out and performed training

00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:31,870
for staff at the hospital what the

00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:34,090
hospital did was elect one person from

00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:35,950
every team or department to go and

00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:38,020
attend this training and this person

00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:41,770
would spend I think they ended up doing

00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:44,320
kind of like you know a four-hour four

00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,880
hours in an afternoon once a week for

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,380
like two months and they would go in and

00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,210
they would do this training with the

00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:52,000
people that wrote the software they

00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:53,920
would make use of it the people writing

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,240
the software would get feedback based on

00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,550
the training they were providing in

00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,320
order to try to make it easier to use

00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:03,100
the software so there's kind of a big

00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:05,800
win there and then the hospital ended up

00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,810
with a group of core people that had all

00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,960
been trained on the software and we're

00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,190
now

00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,950
expected to come back to their

00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:15,160
department and help get that department

00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:18,250
up to speed and so in this case epic

00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:21,040
would provide the they call them super

00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,570
users would provide the super users with

00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,400
the training that they needed and also

00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:26,050
with materials that they could take back

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,760
their to their department to help

00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:30,700
educate them this is how you're going to

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:36,400
be keeping records and it sounds like it

00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:39,310
worked out pretty well um they so they

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,490
would do that you go it's a nice way to

00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:43,780
really rapidly teach people a bunch of

00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,480
stuff because you don't have to have a

00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:49,060
scenario where you've got 200 people in

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,040
a classroom which is tough you can have

00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:53,260
10 people in a classroom and then they

00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,030
can each go teach 10 more people and I

00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:58,270
think there may be some opportunities

00:22:55,030 --> 00:23:01,780
for us and for our community to leverage

00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:04,330
that the other thing that both my dad

00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:07,750
and my wife said a lot about this was

00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:09,310
there was a lot of fear in people making

00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,220
this transition there were a lot of

00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:14,350
nurses that had spent twenty plus years

00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:18,430
charting on paper and now had to switch

00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:20,530
to electronic medical records and a lot

00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:23,020
of them that were near retirement just

00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:25,510
decided to quit instead of switching to

00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,830
the new system because they it wasn't

00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,200
really worth it to them they had two

00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,790
more years to go before retirement they

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,950
could do an early retirement or whatever

00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:36,670
the case was I think the lesson there

00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:38,440
though is that we should expect some

00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:40,570
amount of people to just say you know

00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,400
what this isn't worth it to me I'm not

00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:45,010
going to learn it and we should be okay

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,600
with that like if some people in the

00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:49,180
community decide that they just don't

00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:53,760
want to learn this new thing I guess

00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,760
that's their problem yeah

00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:04,080
so I think this ends up being a good way

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,389
so the question is why why was this a

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,399
good way of doing it and I ultimately I

00:24:06,389 --> 00:24:10,289
think that the answer for what they were

00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:12,899
seeking was a way to really rapidly

00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:15,299
educate a lot of people with it and the

00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:17,789
thing that they benefited from the most

00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:19,860
was this concept of the super user who

00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:21,570
got professional training and then was

00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,700
able to come back to their department

00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:25,409
and teach their department just the

00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,289
things that you needed to know in that

00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:30,960
department and then the other thing that

00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:32,759
they did was the week that the system

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,700
rolled out everyone that was a super

00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:38,789
user wore a green shirt and so for that

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,409
entire week if you had a problem you

00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:42,090
need to go and ask someone wearing a

00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:43,740
green shirt and then they had people

00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:46,409
wearing blue shirts and blue shirts were

00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:48,090
people that actually were engineers on

00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:50,820
the software and so it's like if you

00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:58,470
really have a problem finding the guy

00:24:50,820 --> 00:25:01,409
with the blue shirt yes we are yep and I

00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:03,929
used to Mike in my response if I

00:25:01,409 --> 00:25:07,889
analyzed your answer in a few things I I

00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:10,230
hear a few things that your training

00:25:07,889 --> 00:25:13,649
doesn't need to be gone contain

00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:15,389
everything you may you should at least

00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:17,429
start with what you need to know first

00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:20,940
right for your immediate work and then

00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:24,029
have someone to fall back onto to get to

00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:27,090
get additional information I also here

00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:31,639
somewhere between the lines that to see

00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:36,799
someone using the system and which gives

00:25:31,639 --> 00:25:39,269
my gifts to people who don't know it

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,399
encouragement motivation that it can be

00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:45,869
done yeah absolutely that's that's for

00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:48,899
for bridging the gap of fear so to see

00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:50,999
people working with it oh yeah right

00:25:48,899 --> 00:25:52,860
it's this like my coworker who I know

00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:55,200
and I trust and we like to go out to

00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:57,960
happy hour together did this thing and

00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,990
they're still alive like it must be

00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:04,289
possible I think that I think that

00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:08,789
there's that's a good observation and so

00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:10,269
one of the my ideas based on this what's

00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:13,359
been going out or what I've seen

00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:16,080
in that lesson is that kind of wondering

00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:18,399
is there a way that our community can

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,739
learn from that and do something as well

00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:22,959
and one of the things that came to mind

00:26:20,739 --> 00:26:24,820
for me was kind of based off of the

00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:27,039
stuff that the Drupal ladder people have

00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:30,129
been doing which to me is really like

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,779
they're figuring out ways to leverage

00:26:30,129 --> 00:26:34,869
the fact that we have all of these

00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:36,399
really awesome local communities and

00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:38,200
leaders in those communities who are

00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:41,019
willing to take the time to do things

00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:44,499
like teach people steps from the Drupal

00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:47,519
ladder and and so I have it one of the

00:26:44,499 --> 00:26:51,549
ideas that from there was that could we

00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:53,669
replicate this idea of training super

00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:55,869
users and then sending them out to their

00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:57,729
department and having them train the

00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:59,979
department within our community and if

00:26:57,729 --> 00:27:02,169
we do that what would that look like I

00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:04,779
recognize that a community of volunteers

00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:06,309
has some interesting hurdles like the

00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:09,039
fact that you're not getting paid to

00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:11,229
attend the training but I think that if

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,419
we made it small enough in bite-size

00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:15,399
chunks and interesting enough that

00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:17,440
people may be willing to to pursue

00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:20,950
something like this and so my idea is

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,929
what if we were able to get together a

00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:24,700
core group of people that we're willing

00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:26,739
to spend the time on a monthly basis

00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,129
putting together like a 15 or 20-minute

00:27:26,739 --> 00:27:32,200
curriculum on some specific topic

00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:34,209
working with the initiative owner for

00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,369
what you know something or working with

00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:38,950
the person in our community who is the

00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:41,019
expert on that to ask them questions

00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:44,079
like why is this thing that you're so

00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:46,149
involved in important if you could teach

00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,159
people one thing from it what is the

00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:49,509
thing that you would teach them and you

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:54,690
know kind of some questions like that

00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:59,019
and distill it into a 10 or 15 slide

00:27:54,690 --> 00:28:01,179
presentation and then provide a if it's

00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:03,419
code maybe provide example code to go

00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:05,739
with it maybe even provide activities

00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:08,709
and then an answer sheet for the

00:28:05,739 --> 00:28:10,570
activities so this core group of people

00:28:08,709 --> 00:28:13,029
could write these little miniature

00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:16,629
curriculums and then once that's put

00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:18,940
together we could solicit users or

00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:22,239
someone from various local user groups

00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:23,680
and say hey on the first Tuesday of

00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:26,650
every month we're going

00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,180
to have a google hangout where the

00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:30,610
people that put together this curriculum

00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:32,590
and the expert from our community will

00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:34,390
come and present this curriculum to you

00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:36,310
and answer all of your questions about

00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:38,590
it and then we just ask that you would

00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:41,620
take this back to your local user group

00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:45,450
and spend 15 or 20 minutes sharing that

00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:48,130
information with them so I think that

00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:49,570
it's possibly something that could be

00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:51,460
interesting and we could try to make

00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,890
work I some of the hurdles to me with

00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,750
that are a little bit of the like

00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:57,190
PowerPoint karaoke like you're given

00:28:55,750 --> 00:29:00,010
somebody else's slide deck and then

00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:02,830
expected to present it I think that if

00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:06,040
we keep them short and to the point and

00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:07,510
also that scenario where you've gotten

00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,310
to see somebody else give the

00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:10,900
presentation once and explain to you

00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:14,200
what each of the slides is might help

00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:15,940
with that I think that we have a lot of

00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,010
people in our local user groups that

00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:19,840
would be pretty willing to do this and

00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:22,090
there's a really big benefit to them if

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,100
they're willing to come and attend this

00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:26,860
like hey teach me about these slides

00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:29,740
they had an opportunity to hang out with

00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,880
the people that wrote this aspect of

00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,760
Drupal it and really know what they're

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,170
talking about and they're creating you

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,790
know building karma they're creating

00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:40,000
connections with people for themselves

00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:42,220
that they'll be able to go and ask Larry

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,230
when they have a question about Drupal 8

00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:46,150
hey I know he did this I'm gonna ask him

00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:47,320
that question and you know the truth is

00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,760
in our community we can't answer

00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,230
everybody's questions but we're more

00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,610
likely to help answer questions for

00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,380
people that are going we know are going

00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:57,060
to take the answer and then teach

00:29:53,380 --> 00:30:00,910
everybody else so I think there's some

00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:02,740
opportunities there um I just wanted one

00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:04,930
of the things too with this like if we

00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,670
do some kind of a hang out and do the

00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:09,100
presentation to people who will present

00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:11,620
that can also just be recorded and

00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,300
played back and then a conversation will

00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,920
happen around it there's a lot of people

00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,690
are terrified of presenting and like

00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:19,060
even with the Drupal ladder like we have

00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:21,040
like a lightning talk video that you can

00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:24,850
take to your local user group and just

00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:26,410
play the video and I'll explain to you

00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:28,150
what everything is and then everybody

00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:29,830
can talk about that and some of the

00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:31,090
information so they don't even have to

00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,410
stand up in the front of the room and

00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,720
have everybody stare at them while they

00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,820
try to replicate

00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,470
thing that they saw so just even

00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,360
recording those and distributing those

00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:41,160
two groups but making sure you still

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,050
have like this point of contact in that

00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,940
group who will do it and is sort of

00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,500
seeing the presentation and been able to

00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:49,290
ask questions and then feels more

00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,060
comfortable being this person that

00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:56,390
people can okay that was cool but what

00:30:51,060 --> 00:31:00,960
does this mean um so anyway I do yeah um

00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:02,760
totally and like the point of contact

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,110
thing it to me it was kind of like I

00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,210
didn't really feel like we had to

00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:08,670
designate one person in every user group

00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:11,070
that was the always the point of contact

00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:13,020
you know I imagine in the Minneapolis

00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:15,270
user group we would probably do

00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:17,520
something like elekta person who's going

00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:18,780
to each month go and learn the thing and

00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,020
then come back and teach us because we

00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:24,240
all like to take turns but it could also

00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,820
potentially be beneficial for businesses

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,010
to like if your company is willing to

00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:30,660
send someone to attend this training for

00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:32,400
you know four hours on a Tuesday

00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,950
afternoon and then they can come back

00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,810
and have some material that they can use

00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:40,770
to teach the rest of their co-workers

00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:44,280
that's pretty awesome so is it one of my

00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:47,990
interesting ideas it does bring up this

00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:51,060
aspect I think with education around

00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:52,980
drupal and trying to figure out the

00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,780
place of the community and the place of

00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,150
a company in education and there are

00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,530
certainly I think one of the big

00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:00,030
problems that we're running into you

00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:02,280
right now is there's there's a

00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:04,350
difference between the things that a

00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,270
company that has money and pays their

00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:09,030
employees and can dictate what they do

00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:11,700
can do when it comes to education and

00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:14,610
what we as a community of volunteers are

00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:17,460
able to do my example of this is when

00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:19,320
Drupal 7 came out I had the privilege of

00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:23,100
getting to go on the web chick tour with

00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,900
Angie and the two of us spent about two

00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:28,650
months putting together a two-day

00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:31,080
training paid for so we had time to work

00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:35,390
on it during our work hours and then

00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:38,310
work sent us around all over the US

00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:40,380
giving this two-day training and that's

00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:41,820
just and it was really beneficial I

00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,770
think to everyone that was able to

00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:46,320
attend it but it's not something that a

00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:47,490
community can really do like I don't

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,710
really see our commute

00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:52,080
being able to raise the money to send a

00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:53,910
couple of trainers around you know

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,800
randomly giving trainings here and there

00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:58,170
and so there's a little bit like that

00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:03,480
kind of becomes the domain of a company

00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:05,010
potentially so kind of keeping that in

00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,800
mind I think when we have discussions

00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:09,270
about training in the excuse me training

00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,880
in the Drupal sphere is that there's a

00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:15,750
difference between where the community

00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:18,120
and I am a company all right so now

00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:21,420
you're like sufficiently motivated to

00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:23,490
help train people on Drupal 8 some of my

00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:27,059
ideas about things that that you can

00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:28,470
help out with as an individual we can

00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:30,480
continue to improve our API

00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,790
documentation we can continue to improve

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,440
change notices update the handbook write

00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:36,870
blog posts tell people while you're

00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,580
excited about Drupal 8 and how awesome

00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:43,290
it's going to be for them once they

00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:45,059
learn how to use this new tool so I

00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:46,730
think those are kind of some of the key

00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:50,400
things that we can be doing there and

00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:53,340
then I think as an organization as a

00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:56,820
company that employs people and can fun

00:33:53,340 --> 00:34:00,059
things make sure that you're giving your

00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:02,429
employees time to learn drupal 8 like

00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:04,200
you can't expect them to just show up to

00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:07,290
work on Monday and know how to use

00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,840
Drupal 8 you have to build into their

00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:12,210
work time hours where they get to teach

00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:17,310
themselves or take training to learn

00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:20,010
this stuff another thing that companies

00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:23,310
can do if you have people on staff that

00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:25,020
are being given time to learn drupal 8 a

00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:26,730
really great way to give back to the

00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,679
community would be to also give them

00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:31,919
time to go teach their community about

00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:34,470
Drupal 8 and then of course I think

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,720
companies can in a way that a community

00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:38,580
just can't can help fund curriculum

00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,770
development can help fund on-site

00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:43,609
trainings can help fund public workshops

00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:46,080
all of these things that require like

00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:47,909
financial backing in order to have a

00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,830
space like this to be able to do a

00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:51,359
training lecture as a community we could

00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:54,300
probably write a really great curriculum

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:56,340
but it's hard without some kind of

00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:59,149
funding to find the space to make those

00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,149
trainings happen

00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:07,280
oh it like why did I put this slide here

00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:09,270
what is this amount um I think that

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,830
we're talking about this and it's

00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:13,970
obviously really important I would

00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:16,440
really like to see our community make

00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:19,590
education of people or teaching people

00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,330
about Drupal 8 a first-class problem I

00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:23,880
would like to see it raised to the same

00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:25,680
level of interest and like amount of

00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,110
resources getting dedicated to it as

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,510
something like configuration management

00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:32,970
like it is as important configuration

00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:35,900
management makes it drupal 8 great if

00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:38,280
people a if people don't know how to use

00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:40,740
configuration management it might as

00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,150
well not exist and so I think that

00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,910
there's an opportunity for us to hear

00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:47,220
especially at this point in interpolates

00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:49,080
release cycle to really kind of elevate

00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,300
this to a problem that as a community

00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,830
becomes really important to us is it it

00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:57,840
isn't just something that we happen to

00:35:52,830 --> 00:36:00,300
talk about in passing now and then so I

00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,830
said a bunch of things I talked about

00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,540
things that we're already doing and how

00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:05,580
we can improve them including mostly

00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:07,350
written documentation and how as a

00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:10,410
community like that's a really easy

00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:12,930
thing for us to work on updating I

00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:14,610
talked about how it's really important

00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:16,730
for those of us that are in the

00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:19,860
community and excited about Drupal 8 to

00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:21,900
help sort of distill some of this fear

00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:23,850
and uncertainty around Drupal 8 so that

00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,740
we're providing a comfortable and safe

00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:30,690
environment for people to start learning

00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:32,820
in I talked about being able to look at

00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,440
other examples and gave their look at

00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,730
other companies or people that have been

00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,890
through this process and gave one

00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:41,040
example that I've looked into about how

00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:43,740
we can do with that and we talked about

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,260
providing ways for individuals and

00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:52,530
companies to help with the education

00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:54,270
stuff so now we get to open it up for

00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:58,890
discussion that some of my ideas I would

00:36:54,270 --> 00:37:02,100
love to hear other people's ideas so

00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:04,320
first off for this you know

00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,690
train-the-trainer hierarchy think count

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,880
me in sweet so you know someone wants to

00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:13,950
run that I'm happy to talk about it

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:16,170
happy to be part of that I think one of

00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:18,869
the Robin I've now run a triple a

00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:26,460
training twice you know when is a two

00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:27,690
day one is a two hour yeah and I think

00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:32,339
one of the biggest challenges that I'm

00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:35,670
running into is there's a lot of bass

00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:39,299
concepts that overlap with each other

00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:41,369
and you need to in order to really get

00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:43,529
what you're doing you need to understand

00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:48,029
you know five to eight things

00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:50,730
conceptually and I've been really having

00:37:48,029 --> 00:37:52,319
a hard time figuring out the order in

00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:57,390
which to do those so that it makes sense

00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:59,819
and you know how do you give examples

00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:01,710
and hands-on before you do those

00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,880
concepts and if you do this concepts

00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:05,190
first people get bored before you get

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,599
there just that bootstrap process there

00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:10,500
I think it's gonna be really important I

00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:13,250
haven't figured out yet Oh awesome could

00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:17,670
you could you give an example maybe so

00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:20,460
all right we were doing if you want to

00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:23,400
build a form in Drupal 8 mm-hmm that's a

00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:26,789
class with namespace it ties into

00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:29,519
routing it may tie into dependency

00:38:26,789 --> 00:38:34,259
injection specifically the container

00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:36,809
injection interface that's and you can

00:38:34,259 --> 00:38:38,190
be saving to cmi that's fine right so

00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:43,319
there's so many different things you

00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:46,109
have just no fun yeah and I don't know

00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:49,230
yet just the order of dependency here in

00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:51,029
order to you know be able to teach that

00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,710
most effectively yeah I think that's

00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:55,079
going to be a big challenge just

00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:57,799
collectively I agree do things i think

00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:00,269
that like that is an important thing

00:38:57,799 --> 00:39:02,670
like figuring out what are the base

00:39:00,269 --> 00:39:04,349
concepts you need to know and figuring

00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,730
out how to teach those i would also say

00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:08,579
though that this isn't a new problem

00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:10,410
like is the same in drupal 7 you had to

00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:12,119
learn how hook menu worked before you

00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:14,789
can make a page then you had to learn

00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:16,259
how hook form api work or form api work

00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:17,750
before you could put a form on the page

00:39:16,259 --> 00:39:20,369
so there's still a lot of different

00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:22,230
concepts that we need to learn and part

00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:22,860
of it is just being able to identify

00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:25,380
what

00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,270
those are and catalog them and then

00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:28,980
figure out what's the scent like what

00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:30,990
order makes the most sense for people to

00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,280
learn these things in yeah I I don't

00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:34,110
know but I know that I don't necessarily

00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,150
either but one of the major things we

00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:38,340
need to work out is just you know what

00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:40,580
is the alcohol path to bring people in

00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:43,230
through welcome ya pal so maybe the like

00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:45,780
actionable task here is let's start

00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:47,940
creating a list of the sort of base

00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:51,000
concepts that people need to understand

00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:52,470
but you know yeah before they can really

00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:58,350
hello Ruth along but you have these

00:39:52,470 --> 00:40:00,810
three things what are those yeah so I

00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:04,110
have some high-level feet or high level

00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:06,000
ideas and feedback and some examples so

00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,830
I was always interested in community

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,870
management and how to do things and how

00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:12,390
to roll out stuff and how to organize

00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:15,480
things and I recently a few months ago

00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:18,930
had had several revelations after i read

00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:21,030
a book that i plug multiple places and

00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:22,530
jess already knows about that and I and

00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:24,120
I got several key members in the

00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:25,620
community to read it so I'll expand

00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,210
steam for example is just reading it we

00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:29,430
talked about it yesterday and he is

00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:31,140
sparking a lot of ideas in him so you

00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:33,990
have this great idea about the epic

00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:36,330
rollout and that book has 50 or 60 of

00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:39,900
those things of those exams awesome is

00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:41,790
cheap and then Heath switch the book

00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,920
title switch hmm the authors are cheap

00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:45,480
and then heat ok and how to make change

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,570
when change is hard and they have a lot

00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,190
of examples of how you how you make very

00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:52,400
hard changes when you are not the bus

00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:56,100
and you seemingly have no power at all

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,960
and still you can like save species or

00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,300
you can save cities or you can get

00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:03,090
people to come to your car wash or you

00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:05,550
can get kids to take medicine for cancer

00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:07,170
so there's a lot of things I loved it

00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:10,230
the example is you could save a species

00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:13,440
or you could get your car washed both

00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:15,360
big changes for some people yeah so so a

00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,560
lot of those examples there and go and

00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,660
some things that i started doing

00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,640
afterwards for the multilingual

00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:22,200
initiative is i figured that drupal 8 is

00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,870
very scary for a lot of people's i

00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,280
started to do bite size while i wanted

00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:28,350
to have bite-sized articles they are

00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,710
long articles but i started writing

00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:33,600
tidbits and i'm at 14 i think or 15 and

00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:36,000
i'm still like only halfway into all the

00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:38,010
changes around multilingual and

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,900
it's getting people very excited about

00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:42,240
all the small things that like step by

00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:46,230
step so they have like a digestible

00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:48,390
piece and I i figured i need to get

00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:49,920
people to work on some of issues related

00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:51,540
to those problems so i always couple

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,430
them with lists of links of issues that

00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,930
are still outstanding yep so here's the

00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:57,540
new here's the good news for you here's

00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:58,860
the bad news for you but if this gets

00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:01,050
fixed here's how it's gonna be even

00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:03,480
worse these are the things I maybe those

00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:05,190
are bad so you can still fix them so I

00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,860
get get people involved through there as

00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:10,140
well and I also learned to respect all

00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:12,210
the work that my team does better so I i

00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:14,490
invested a lot in improving my slides

00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:16,770
and the design and the delivery and the

00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:19,230
figures and all of that in there and

00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:21,840
just like consolidated down so it's much

00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:23,670
better presented and and the team gets a

00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:26,070
lot more visibility so I very much agree

00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:27,600
that we should do a lot more and it just

00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:30,420
becomes this very positive experience

00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:32,130
for everyone like you for the team for

00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,170
everyone that gets to read about it so

00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:36,780
now all of a sudden they're like well

00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:39,570
that sounds really cool not oh god I

00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:41,850
don't want to go there and it's amazing

00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:44,130
what that does for someone's interest in

00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:46,680
learning something yeah I totally agree

00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:49,590
and I also will point out that I think

00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:51,960
that even in the last couple of weeks we

00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:56,610
there's been a ton of really good

00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:58,350
articles and blog posts that are talking

00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:00,360
about all the really cool new changes in

00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:01,770
Drupal 8 and you know talking about them

00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,270
in a way that is like this is really

00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:05,070
great and positive and here's why it's

00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:06,840
great not this is really great but

00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:09,660
here's all this cruft that you need to

00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:11,280
worry about and and I think we'll

00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:14,130
continue to improve doing that as well

00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,920
yeah awesome thank you i will definitely

00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:18,690
check that book out yeah i'm gonna have

00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:22,110
to read it to at this point because

00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:23,790
everyone else is time so that there's

00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:25,890
two things that I just wanted to

00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:27,090
highlight well because if you're here at

00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:29,220
this session you're probably interested

00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:33,080
in these topics um actually it's just

00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:35,250
one thing anyway so to mock tomorrow on

00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:37,980
web chick and Ethel Jonesy and I are

00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:40,590
doing a lab on upgrading modules to

00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:42,450
Drupal 8 so we're it's different from

00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:44,620
its not like larious module like right a

00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:48,760
modular Drupal 8 way it's theirs

00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:52,240
talk sorry the idea is that I give

00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:54,040
people the tools they need to start

00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,870
putting them on so it's like you have a

00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,700
slide that's almost exactly like a slide

00:43:55,870 --> 00:44:00,100
from our dash right so its life like you

00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:02,200
know get people but what we're doing is

00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:04,330
we're making them in the room create

00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:06,160
that 8x branch of their project and push

00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:08,370
it to Drupal a torch so that's done like

00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,870
you're there you've had to do it now um

00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:12,730
my name sir we're going to try to work

00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:14,470
teaching people how to upgrade models in

00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:17,470
Drupal 8 but then we're also going to

00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:19,060
try to garnish from that things that

00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:22,480
people have trouble with mm-hmm and then

00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:24,670
following that session um we're i'm

00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,710
doing a buff ish I mean it's like after

00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:28,930
hours bought in that room when till they

00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:31,720
kick us out so like if you're interested

00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:33,940
in this topic it's um you know just come

00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:36,670
to like there's it's upgrade your MyLab

00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:39,810
model to Drupal 8 lab just come to 6pm

00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:42,940
at the end to that same room um and

00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:44,170
we'll be there so that's all I remember

00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:46,510
not and then the other thing I like

00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:48,730
about the thing that I'm the goal I set

00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:51,250
for myself about being positive about

00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:52,810
Drupal 8 is that you know I would just

00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:56,350
make a nice tweet once a week like I

00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:59,200
mean you know I it's so easy it's so

00:44:56,350 --> 00:45:01,450
easy smile and like say hey this is

00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,900
awesome but we just need to do it a lot

00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:06,910
yeah I think that you were talking a

00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,200
little bit about the like the session

00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:10,450
that you guys have tomorrow and upgrade

00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:13,660
updating people's modules to Drupal 8

00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:16,030
and being able to learn lessons from

00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:17,230
them while they're attempting to update

00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:19,840
it and I think that that would be a

00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:22,960
really cool side benefit to our

00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:27,700
community of this like making education

00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:29,920
more important is that we every time you

00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:31,420
teach somebody how to use some system

00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,970
you learn about all the things in that

00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:38,590
system that suck and I learned Drupal

00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:40,360
long before I started teaching people

00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:41,890
how to use it and then I'd start

00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:44,200
teaching these classes and people would

00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:45,520
just be like this is so bizarre why do

00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,960
you do it that way and I'm I don't know

00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,850
that's just the way we do it and then I

00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,770
would stop and be like you're right that

00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:53,680
is really bizarre and it could be better

00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:56,140
but for me it's just so ingrained and I

00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,910
think that if our community spent time

00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:00,099
like investing in

00:45:57,910 --> 00:46:01,990
these educational resources and stuff

00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:03,970
we're going to bubble up those issues a

00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:05,950
lot earlier we're going to bubble them

00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:08,289
up while we can still deal with them not

00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:12,460
you know ten months after the products

00:46:08,289 --> 00:46:15,549
been released so you mentioned the

00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:18,099
change notices being a better step

00:46:15,549 --> 00:46:19,930
forward than the greatest of things that

00:46:18,099 --> 00:46:21,670
change but how useful is that for

00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:22,690
someone who you know they have their

00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:24,970
modules and they want to come and

00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:26,799
upgrade them but we're not expecting

00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:29,140
them to go and read three thousand

00:46:26,799 --> 00:46:30,730
changes right but if we're if we're

00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:32,829
starring things like how much of a

00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:35,319
dependency on knowing what came before

00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:37,569
is it so you know you star this post on

00:46:35,319 --> 00:46:39,309
cmi and this is how it works but it

00:46:37,569 --> 00:46:41,530
changes six months down the line and

00:46:39,309 --> 00:46:42,880
like how far down this train of people

00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:45,039
going to have to look and how are we

00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,869
going to address like where are they

00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:51,039
going to go in together yeah and I guess

00:46:46,869 --> 00:46:53,230
I I don't really know the answer to that

00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:55,599
question and part of my part of my big

00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:59,530
problem with change notices is there are

00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:01,720
just there is such a volume of them that

00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:03,819
it's really hard to figure out what's

00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,799
going on they're a great resource for I

00:47:03,819 --> 00:47:07,779
already know that I need to make this

00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:12,099
change here's where I can figure out how

00:47:07,779 --> 00:47:14,140
to do it I think that I don't think it's

00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:17,020
really any different in that sense than

00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:19,599
the giant page that listed all of the

00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:21,760
changes between Drupal 6 in Drupal 7 you

00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:23,859
can search now which is kind of helpful

00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,230
but it still doesn't mean you're going

00:47:23,859 --> 00:47:27,609
to find the thing that you were actually

00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:29,260
interested in yeah and I feel like it

00:47:27,609 --> 00:47:31,240
holds this historical record of things

00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:32,980
that aren't necessarily important right

00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:35,170
now because I you know it doesn't really

00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:36,670
matter to me how see a my work years ago

00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:39,279
I just but it's also like like

00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:40,720
documentation is organic right we don't

00:47:39,279 --> 00:47:43,089
star something once and then leave it

00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:46,210
start forever as soon as it's important

00:47:43,089 --> 00:47:50,859
we need to make it an onion important

00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:55,119
unimportant and so part of that maybe is

00:47:50,859 --> 00:47:56,710
just a maintenance issue but it's

00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,690
definitely a good point is like there

00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:01,029
there's all these change logs that are

00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:05,230
like the thing that we changed before

00:48:01,029 --> 00:48:07,089
changed again it's like okay so we're

00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:09,369
trying to fix that but it's quite a

00:48:07,089 --> 00:48:10,580
process because I don't think any of us

00:48:09,369 --> 00:48:12,200
really anticipated that we

00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:14,450
be rewriting the change notice for the

00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,760
entity API ten times over the course of

00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:19,340
the release cycle but so we actually do

00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:21,140
go back and when there isn't a change

00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:23,090
notice for a previous version of some

00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:24,830
API change we go back and say update the

00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:26,690
existing change notice instead so we are

00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:27,860
to do that there's still a lot of them

00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:30,410
and there's probably duplicates out

00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:32,420
there and I think it's probably going to

00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:33,920
be a sprint Sunday to just like have a

00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:35,240
group of people power through and make

00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,880
sure that we'd reduce that as much as

00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:39,350
possible but they are searchable and you

00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,910
know the process that we ask people use

00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,930
is like you know try something when you

00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:43,790
get an error message and it breaks

00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:46,010
search for the keyword what I think

00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:49,010
would be great is if we had a way to

00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:50,930
have people identify the thing that

00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:52,610
broke for them that that changed notice

00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:54,320
help them fix and I don't know an idea

00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:55,520
in my head of what it is yet I mean they

00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,260
are comment above so you can put

00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,490
comments on them but the comments I

00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:01,100
don't think are indexed so that doesn't

00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:02,450
really help um but that's definitely a

00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,860
min like in the back of my head for a

00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:07,220
while I think maybe we also need to

00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:10,880
remember that like change notices aren't

00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:12,560
an educational tool for someone that is

00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,390
just learning the system they're an

00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:16,670
educational tool for those of us that

00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:18,650
already know how to do things in Drupal

00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:21,140
8 and we need to transfer our knowledge

00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:24,200
or sorry in Drupal 7 it need to transfer

00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:26,240
our knowledge to Drupal 8 and they're a

00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,710
good resource for people that are just

00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,090
getting started because they contain a

00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:31,340
lot of useful information like

00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:35,240
background information if you want that

00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:36,890
but they're they're not the you should

00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:45,260
go and learn drupal 8 by reading the

00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:46,670
changelog yeah they changed notices I

00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:50,840
think we have not done as good a job

00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:52,880
especially recently about grouping them

00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,020
logically at the moment changed notices

00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,940
are targeted at an audience of people

00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:57,020
who are tracking Drupal 8 they're not

00:49:55,940 --> 00:50:00,500
targeted people who are going to be

00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:02,120
coming from 7 20 to 80 and that's

00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,950
something we definitely need to clean up

00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:06,800
there and probably consolidate like a

00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:09,020
third of them so it's there's a lot of

00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,340
work still to do there and probably a

00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:12,080
lot of them should we change to be much

00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:16,700
smaller and just be links off to other

00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:20,090
documentation another good resource just

00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:21,440
for concepts our article I was reading

00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:25,550
recently I can't remem

00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:29,569
which paper I believe the title was how

00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:32,960
good ideas propagate and I'm just

00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:35,480
talking about why certain good ideas in

00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:38,839
medicine got picked up by doctors within

00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:41,569
a year and others took a generation and

00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:44,150
then looking at you know how you how you

00:50:41,569 --> 00:50:46,520
change medical practices across entire

00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:49,430
country and there are two main things

00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:51,730
that it pointed out and I retweet the

00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:54,560
article if I can find it again one

00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:56,690
people doing things will change their

00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:59,119
approach or mindset only if they see an

00:50:56,690 --> 00:51:00,440
immediate benefit they will knock you

00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,150
know just on their own if they can see

00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:04,790
at the example that had was doctors

00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:06,650
using ether for surgery which meant oh

00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:08,390
good I can perform surgery in the

00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:10,400
patient is not failing and hitting me in

00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:11,960
the face and screaming at me this is

00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,510
something dr. benefits from immediately

00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:18,530
and tear all going to do it antibiotics

00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:19,819
and sterilization during a surgery keeps

00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:21,589
the patient from dying six weeks later

00:51:19,819 --> 00:51:24,230
so the doctor doesn't see the benefit

00:51:21,589 --> 00:51:28,210
themselves so it took a generation of

00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:30,589
hard education to make that change and

00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:33,710
when you have that case the thing that

00:51:30,589 --> 00:51:37,220
makes the change personal contact people

00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:38,930
don't listen to broadcast and get ideas

00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:41,810
from broadcast that changed the way they

00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:43,310
think people listen to this person I

00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:45,680
already know who I have coffee with

00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:47,300
suggest this this person i'm working

00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,579
with who's coming into my hospital to

00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:51,770
train me in how to take care of newborns

00:51:49,579 --> 00:51:53,000
so they don't get hyperthermia am just

00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:55,420
taught me this and i internalized it

00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,640
that person the person contact is

00:51:55,420 --> 00:52:00,589
important and is necessary for changing

00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,690
mindset and changing approach and that

00:52:00,589 --> 00:52:04,880
that's what i really like about this you

00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:07,130
know network effect and the tree idea

00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:12,859
that we can have that kind of phone tree

00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:16,579
of my drupal support tree yeah or you

00:52:12,859 --> 00:52:18,380
know or pyramid scheme either way some

00:52:16,579 --> 00:52:21,500
of both i think yeah will trick you into

00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:24,140
learning drupal 8 excellent but it's

00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:27,530
just that you know doing things in you

00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:29,540
know user groups of 20 people it's going

00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:31,250
to be more effective than a training lab

00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:33,290
of 200 people because you can have that

00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:34,850
personal contact so we need to make sure

00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:37,610
we can scale it

00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:39,110
out that way rather than you know 2,000

00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:41,630
person trainings have lots and lots of

00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:44,450
20 person trainings that we'll just have

00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:46,070
I think a much better effect I'm pretty

00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:47,720
much more a much more cost effective and

00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:49,910
time-effective and get the message

00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:54,500
across better yeah I definitely agree

00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:56,780
with you and that I do hi you said that

00:52:54,500 --> 00:53:00,020
you wanted to hear our first experiences

00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:01,940
when learning drupal 8 huh I'm gonna sit

00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:03,560
same summer as mine I started like with

00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:05,000
seven I started reading patches on the

00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:07,220
issue queues and seeing what I could

00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,410
jump in and help and after like three

00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:10,760
days trying to read issues i realized i

00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:12,410
didn't understand a thing of these

00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:15,140
patches there were many things that i

00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:17,900
didn't understand so i decided have to

00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:20,660
step back ah i read act the same phony

00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:22,280
to book mmm then our website on same

00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:24,080
pony just to play with it and then after

00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:26,270
a month or something i went back to the

00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,340
issue queue and I oh this is a namespace

00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:30,500
yeah this is the controlling around this

00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:33,320
before yeah of course now it makes sense

00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:36,680
I also read PHP 5 points with release

00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:38,450
notes and I what I was what I realized

00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:40,700
with that is that without those basic

00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:43,520
foundations it's really hard for anybody

00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:45,440
to jump in and help it's not like when

00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:49,370
we were turning from Drupal 6 or Drupal

00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:51,410
7 now you need more background now you

00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:54,350
need to stop for a bit and read before

00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:56,270
jumping in I think yeah I've had a few

00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:58,340
conversations about the same thing in

00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:59,870
like the background that you need and I

00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:01,820
don't know if I would necessarily say

00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:04,120
you need more but you need a different

00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:07,010
background than you needed for Drupal 7

00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:09,290
and I know for me when I first started

00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:10,790
playing with Drupal 8 stuff and trying

00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:12,740
to record a video about how to make a

00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:14,450
module all these things kept coming up

00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:15,890
when I was trying to learn about it that

00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:18,020
I was like what what is this and I'd

00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:19,730
search on API dr. bulldog and nothing

00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:21,980
would come up and eventually I'd learned

00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:23,840
oh this is just a PHP thing that I

00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:26,690
wasn't aware of and so there there's

00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:28,460
certainly that aspect of it too like we

00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:30,880
are switching to some new programming

00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:32,930
paradigms we need to make sure that

00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,940
probably we need to make sure that we're

00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:36,920
pointing people at the already written

00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:39,040
really good documentation and books

00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:42,080
about those things and maybe also

00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:44,810
helping them know that like it's worth

00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:48,130
it to go and take the time to learn PHP

00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:49,210
even if you think you already learned it

00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:50,380
because there are new concepts or

00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:51,400
they're just different ways that we're

00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:53,020
finding things that they are not that

00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:56,200
new they have been there for ages okay

00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:57,970
Dino to me the technologies of course of

00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:00,550
course but all the technology have been

00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:01,960
have been implementing this so my when I

00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:03,370
was telling these two people on home

00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,930
events they were like oh I need to read

00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:06,910
new stuff on it study yeah but the thing

00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:09,160
is that all ethnology are doing it so if

00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:10,120
you don't know them it means that you

00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,980
know when you move on to other

00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:14,860
technologies you're gonna make use of

00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:19,450
that same concepts and I think in that

00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:21,910
too is this cool idea that by getting

00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:23,080
people excited about learning those or

00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:24,460
one of the things we can do to get

00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,500
people excited about the fact that they

00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:29,830
have to learn that you can you know

00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:32,500
return a new static method from whatever

00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:35,550
inside of whatever PHP stuff I don't

00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:38,200
even know how to explain it is that

00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:39,640
they're they're learning skills there

00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:42,280
that are going to be applicable in other

00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:44,350
places as well and not just like oh you

00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:46,330
have to learn this thing because Drupal

00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:49,120
it's like hey you get to learn this cool

00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:51,490
new way of doing things in a new

00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:53,950
technology era Lee new technology new to

00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:56,470
us technology or way of doing things

00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:58,390
that could be relevant in a lot of other

00:55:56,470 --> 00:56:00,130
contacts too so let's talk about that

00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:01,420
more and lets you know so that people

00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:06,150
can get excited if I'm going to invest

00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:08,440
10 hours in learning these PHP concepts

00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:10,390
it's really good to know that I can use

00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:13,080
them in other places too like symphony

00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:16,450
or whatever you know whatever other

00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:19,510
framework or CMS I may be interested in

00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:25,600
working with as well exactly yeah thanks

00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:27,430
thank you hi hi so I I definitely was

00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,500
thinking about making sure people know

00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:31,360
some of the basics of PHP 5 and

00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:34,210
object-oriented programming that you

00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:36,760
know we tend to be so Drupal focused and

00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:39,040
you know we need people to kind of step

00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,950
back and so I I'm totally in agreement

00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:43,369
with him

00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:45,619
and the other thing that I think we need

00:56:43,369 --> 00:56:48,020
to figure out is I want to do the

00:56:45,619 --> 00:56:49,970
superuser proposal that you have there

00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:53,960
but we need more resources to send

00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:55,400
people to after the session um I people

00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,869
are just clamoring they're like well

00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:01,160
where do i go to find out about this and

00:56:56,869 --> 00:57:04,010
this and that I'm like you know so right

00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:05,960
it yeah and then it'll be there next

00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:08,180
time so I'm glad that you mentioned the

00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:09,589
example modules and I do think that's

00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:12,290
something we could focus on to give

00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:14,270
people some example code to just help

00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:16,099
them grasp what kind of code am I going

00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:18,170
to write yeah there's there's been a lot

00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:19,490
of movement on those recently too which

00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:21,650
is nice and there's also been some

00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:24,020
pushes to put aspects of the examples

00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:27,200
module into Drupal core so that they

00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:30,140
continue to stay updated but whatever

00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:32,660
the case may be I think that it is time

00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:34,880
for us nano to update those and then one

00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:36,470
other plug I was talking to Morton

00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,329
earlier today and he wants to do an

00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:40,190
examples type module for front-end

00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:42,859
developers to know how they could start

00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:45,050
using Drupal 8 and twig yeah that would

00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:47,780
be coming on you know so many people

00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:49,609
learn learn from being especially an

00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:51,380
open source we learn from being able to

00:57:49,609 --> 00:57:53,180
look at examples and copy and paste them

00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:54,890
and there's you know there's all this

00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:56,900
like fear about being able to learn how

00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:58,310
to do things the new PHP way it's like

00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:00,530
well you learned how to do them the old

00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:03,380
PHP way by copying and pasting it and

00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:04,910
then and learning it and I sure will

00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:07,700
lose some people but I think a lot of

00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:10,880
people are perfectly happy to repeat

00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:12,740
that process if it exists the examples

00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,750
module I personally I have mixed

00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:17,119
feelings about it's not leave alone

00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:19,880
personal feelings what I see in in

00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:21,220
learning and also my experience this

00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:27,420
afternoon in

00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:30,910
in Larry's very short training is that

00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:33,670
example code is part but also you need

00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:37,690
of you absolutely that's often missing

00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:39,820
in the scattered information that we

00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:42,280
have or that open sources usually have

00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:43,660
which you fight back in books or in

00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,520
training courses where you get an

00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:47,590
overview and introduction and this is

00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:50,170
this is picture we painting it now you

00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:53,080
got your example code go work so like we

00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:54,910
do a good job of documenting these like

00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:57,040
discreet things that you might be trying

00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:58,420
to do but not as good a job as saying

00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:01,180
here's how you put all of those together

00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:03,010
into those like Oh system those graphics

00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:04,780
personally they helped me because they

00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:07,720
give me a picture oh this is the process

00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:11,740
oh and I'm not here I'm at the end okay

00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:13,840
now I know where I'm where I am when of

00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:15,700
the one of the things that I've seen on

00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:20,650
drupal.org that I really really liked

00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:22,540
was people writing I don't think it was

00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:24,520
maybe the book module but there was a

00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:26,740
bunch of documentation written about

00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:28,900
like this is how the book module works

00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:30,130
now and it wasn't just like here's how

00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,540
it was updated and the things that

00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:33,609
changed it was like here's how

00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:35,890
dependency injection is used within the

00:59:33,609 --> 00:59:38,440
book model and it's like like linked to

00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:40,540
the resource that explains what depends

00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:43,240
dependency injection is but we also need

00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:45,070
to explain like not just what it is but

00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:48,359
how you use it in the greater context

00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:52,210
and the water and wine yes exactly yeah

00:59:48,359 --> 00:59:55,030
and there's another thing while we are

00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:58,740
at the point that we that we all have to

00:59:55,030 --> 01:00:01,599
learn as trainers have to learn drupal 8

00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:06,480
up to extend that we can explain it and

01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:10,390
we have a training curriculum for it I

01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:14,160
hope that there will be more exchange of

01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:17,470
those those two training information I

01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:19,510
we made our own training course for

01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:22,089
Drupal 6 and use that for triple seven

01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:23,920
but now we well at least fifty percent

01:00:22,089 --> 01:00:25,510
we have to start over again and maybe

01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,970
eighty percent where I've start off no

01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:29,920
problem but then we can share we can

01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:32,910
perhaps we can start sharing information

01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:35,490
and just publishing it on

01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:36,960
you though or well yeah that's

01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:39,660
definitely something I would like to see

01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:42,540
here and then share more of the

01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:45,030
information yep like we don't have to

01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:46,860
work out the whole training you and I

01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:48,840
are already writing the same curriculum

01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:51,150
yeah why don't we why don't we talk

01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:53,430
about I know every epidural condit

01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:59,730
discussions comes up yeah we have to

01:00:53,430 --> 01:01:02,100
start sometime that article was talking

01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:03,630
about it's called how the good ideas

01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:05,280
spread is in The New Yorker I just

01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:10,560
tweeted a link to it perfect my account

01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:12,270
awesome along the line of the examples

01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,500
module there's a similar resource that

01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:16,530
does already have code and although it's

01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:18,720
in a much smaller scope on the the pants

01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:20,700
project dribble the dog special project

01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:23,370
stressed plants is it's what we're using

01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:25,610
in our lab tomorrow so um what what Alex

01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:27,960
Brownstein is is he went through um

01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:29,100
there's a new branch for Prague so if

01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:30,840
you do look at it be sure to look at the

01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:32,340
Frog branch because branches for

01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:36,510
previous trip pecans are extremely stale

01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:38,040
and not working cool um but so what it

01:01:36,510 --> 01:01:39,780
does is he goes through very carefully

01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:42,360
the process of porting a module on

01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:44,670
starting from you know the beginning

01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:47,070
step of my module doesn't show up on the

01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:48,930
page oh that has to do with my info file

01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:51,630
and then he references the change notice

01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:53,370
for the info te amo conversion in his

01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:55,770
commit message in that in that get

01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:58,200
history so he it starts off in the very

01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:59,160
being there and he has tags periodically

01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,600
throughout the commit history that

01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:02,370
indicate when each milestone was made so

01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,690
like this is when I at you know I

01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:05,430
finished my controller and my page

01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:06,810
callback was working and and you know

01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:08,100
this is when i got my configuration for

01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:09,600
him working and so on and so forth so

01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:11,040
it's actually it's actually a really

01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,990
great resource and we're not you know

01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:15,480
we're only going to be covering like the

01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:16,830
very very high level in our lab but for

01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,210
people who want to drill in more there's

01:02:16,830 --> 01:02:19,620
actually they can go step through commit

01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:21,630
like so this is a good resource for

01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:24,900
people that are trying to figure out how

01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:26,700
to port there but code in the end in the

01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:28,500
final case it also has examples of basic

01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:30,300
ideas yeah which is is from awesome

01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:33,720
integer I also get a little bit

01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:35,730
concerned about like the discoverability

01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:37,530
of it people already know about the

01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:39,540
examples project that's like a ton of

01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:41,730
people know of its existence are already

01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:44,880
using it as a resource for Drupal 7 and

01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:45,590
I would like to see us right now okay if

01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,850
you if you

01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:48,860
if you're looking for a resource to

01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:50,900
share with someone right now that has an

01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:52,730
example of the you know the eighty

01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:54,950
percent use case of what a Drupal a

01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:56,360
little drupal module does um you know

01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:58,070
that's that's a resources there and

01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:59,150
we've know there's there's been there's

01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:01,820
been a lot of time put into it's at

01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:03,530
school even has examples of making see

01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:07,970
tools plugins into your light plugin oh

01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:09,470
man it's fancy complicated I just wanted

01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:11,000
to mention real quick in terms of that

01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:13,340
sharing curriculum stuff that's

01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,290
something that i think i am personally

01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:18,320
we as a team that utilize me you're

01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:20,060
really interested in as well and we've

01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:22,610
actually for drupal 8 we've actually

01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:26,240
already started with jess and Chris

01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:28,340
Shattuck and joan myself we are we have

01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,350
a curriculum that we're developing in

01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:33,170
github it's it's a github account under

01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:34,940
Jess's github account where we're

01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:38,090
starting to outline videos that we can

01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:40,580
make together as a collaborative effort

01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:42,440
and the curriculum is on github and just

01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:45,440
available for anybody wants to fork and

01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:46,520
help with that curriculum and as we

01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,940
build that out we're going to start

01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:51,860
releasing videos on that material and

01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:54,290
it's been interesting to try and

01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:56,150
collaborate across you know we have our

01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:58,130
way of doing things and chris has his

01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:59,960
way of doing things and jess's a lot of

01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:03,560
information and all of us coming

01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:05,510
together it's at times awkward but it's

01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,860
interesting to figure out how to create

01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:08,240
a curriculum together in that

01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:10,160
collaborative way so if anybody's

01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:12,140
interested in doing that that I think we

01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,550
all end up with something better as a

01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:17,690
result for having gone through all of

01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:20,840
that we are like five minutes and 17

01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:22,880
seconds over time right now so i just

01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:25,130
wanted to point this out real quick i'm

01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:27,830
guessing most of you posed in core if

01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:29,840
you're interested in learning drupal 8

01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:31,640
these Sprint's are a great way to learn

01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,930
something about you know what's going on

01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:35,450
they're also a really great opportunity

01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:36,260
to get to teach somebody about Drupal 8

01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:37,580
and I'm guessing you're probably

01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:38,780
attending this session because you're

01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:40,610
interested in teaching people about

01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:43,880
Drupal 8 so this is a good chance to do

01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:45,830
so and also that I I will be there on

01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,210
Friday in the for the first half of the

01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:48,890
day I'm going to be helping it with the

01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:51,260
workshop in the morning but then in the

01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:53,060
afternoon if people are interested in

01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:55,850
continuing this discussion I will be

01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:57,740
around and more than happy to continue

01:04:55,850 --> 01:05:02,810
talking about

01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:06,170
learning drupal stuff and then the

01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:09,860
obligatory please go and rate my session

01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:11,119
slide that's what I got and I will also

01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:13,940
happy to stick around and answer

01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:16,550
questions outside but it is six o'clock
