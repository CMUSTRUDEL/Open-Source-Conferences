Title: DrupalCon Prague 2013: DRUPAL FIXED BUDGET PROJECTS: THE ART OF ESTIMATES
Publication date: 2013-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Prague - September 2013
Description: 
	In many countries accross Europe, websites projects are bought using fixed budget engagements from vendors.

RFPs we receive have often a very poor level of details, while client still wait for a fixed budget and timeframe.

During this session we'll present how we do at Adyax, bidding on fixed budget projects only to ensure that projects are always delivered and we get some money for it.

Session will cover several key points, like :

How to analyse and RFP and convert it to a Drupal Project Plan
How to count templates and related charges
Reading between the RFPs lines, detect those features that are not clearly described
How to avoid being the most expensive bidder by providing options
Some sharing about our estimation rules, tips & tricks
How to prepare a detailled planning
Important risks that can blow up your margins
In what Drupal is so different from others CMS / Frameworks
How to keep an eye, during the project on your margin
How to deal with change requests and evolutions
How to make your customer happy even when you ask them more money and/or time
10 usual mistakes that any Drupal Shop do.
Session will be supported with a set of concrete examples...

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,629
so thank you being here first of all my

00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:11,219
name is Maksym i'm the co-founder of a

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:14,429
DX we we are here as also to and we do

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:17,520
only fix budget projects a lot of them

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,350
and and the funny thing that almost all

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,869
the estimates are known by me so I'm the

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,720
guy who is always wrong so that's why I

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,910
was like present in this session the

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,400
usual size of the project runs from

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,980
three thousand to fifteen thousands of

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,930
man-hours so it's quite big projects I

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:39,540
don't know which right size of you and

00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:42,329
so we all talk about estimates and

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,890
probably the estimating is quite the

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,480
most dangerous work because you are

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,190
playing with money and if you're losing

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,460
money on the very big projects it might

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,160
be really complicated for some companies

00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:57,270
how much of you are did project was

00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:00,870
losing money on projects like I say the

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,030
truth ok that's the water ok so that's

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,450
quite normal I mean everybody makes

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,909
errors and estimates and from what I

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,200
know that seventy percent of IT projects

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,939
are late and if you are like you're

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:17,610
probably losing money on some way or

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:20,670
majan at least so this everybody knows

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,549
these scary deadlines approaching in at

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,259
people to do more and and the dead

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,659
lights are never met and after a while

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,640
nobody cares about deadlines and yes i

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,380
will do it adds up and and of course in

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,150
the company if you do not let deadlines

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,130
you are probably wrong with estimates

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,320
you lose money or your team is being

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,979
like more Alexis with possessed image

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,960
within its control of the time frames

00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:45,479
and and that's the funny thing is that

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,460
we are quite smart here all the guys we

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,280
are attending drupalcon we do we know

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,590
views panels you some of you or install

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,490
Drupal 8 and know how you same funny now

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:59,850
and and again we still doing very basic

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:04,860
errors and estimates even if you are

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:07,920
quite smart guys m and in but in the

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,780
everyday life like your daily life you

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,930
do a lot of estimates every time and

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,860
you're doing pretty well I think imagine

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,360
your own prag like

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,610
right now and you have a good friend

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,730
calling using without saying Gail let's

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,520
having a beer somewhere in the wine in a

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,990
good bar in Prague and well what you'll

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,510
do you'll probably open your google maps

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,730
you'll check out the address you say

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,100
okay I need 28 minutes to go there i

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,470
will add five minutes and it's only for

00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,960
task jobs you go down you walk to the

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,840
metro you take tram you take a metal and

00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,870
you arrive and even there you probably

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,530
know some friends that always late even

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,300
this simple tasks so on the project it's

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,850
like in this project it's very simple

00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:54,150
project you always have some errors and

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:56,430
estimating unpredictable errors some

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,590
unpredictable events what you should

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,720
have think about imagine you will go

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,300
there and there is a strike so you'll be

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,970
Layton you have to go back by walking to

00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,220
this bar so you have to add these things

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:11,820
of this risk to your project planet view

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:15,090
time frame unfortunately some events

00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:17,340
have so big impact or so empiric table

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,230
that's it's almost impossible to to

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,690
prevent imagine there is an atomic bomb

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:24,269
throwing down to drag you there will be

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,890
no bar no friend probably no more you so

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:27,720
it's like we infinite journey for you

00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:34,830
and and there is no way to predict this

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:37,170
risk right so bed button Drupal projects

00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,209
and more and IT projects there are not

00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,489
so many unpredictable events that can

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:45,780
occur basically we could split them into

00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:48,000
three main groups the first one is who

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,130
is doing the estimates usually it will

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,209
be the project manager the salesperson

00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:56,209
the senior developer the guys within

00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:58,530
relationship with the client and

00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:01,170
actually this is not the guy who will

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,549
actually call the thing and you cannot

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,640
have a company with one hundred percent

00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:07,730
on it's only senior positions so the guy

00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,380
who will actually work on it will do it

00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:12,299
with junior position so you will have

00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:15,000
for example somebody will how much time

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:17,459
you need to the team a web form or half

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,769
a day and then if you give it to a guy

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,900
and he'll like look what swore web form

00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,120
how it works with widgets I have the

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,960
problem in internet explorer 8 and then

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,270
he'll spend two days

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,550
so this is a usual problem when you do

00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:33,400
estimates this probably senior guy doing

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:38,380
it and that's my acute at this jr. will

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:41,650
then you and the second problem is the

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:45,220
perimeter problem or misunderstanding or

00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:47,110
changes in the perimeter so if usual

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,030
problem like we faced every day like I

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,949
need a workflow okay we'll do a workflow

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,139
you think about like a couple of rules

00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:55,030
couple of rolls and at the end the

00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:58,210
client arise I said no no when I want to

00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:01,500
do workflow I wanted a notification five

00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:04,000
rolls permission user groups and and

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,949
dashboards and everything and then you

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,160
say oh which is not what was expected

00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:13,240
and say it was written in the specs do

00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:15,550
it okay you lose money and the final is

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,520
less important i think is the human

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,650
factor well that's alright like maybe

00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,479
two or three times in a DX the project

00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,699
management leaves or breaks a hand and

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:30,070
well left hand is not that important but

00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:34,810
right hands more so this is almost all

00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:36,550
that can occur during a project but what

00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,639
do we really estimate in the drupal

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:42,340
project so when you take the code the

00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,039
air FB you will probably have to split

00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,380
down the project in two parts so before

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,199
going into details let's define some

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,960
variables will use those variables all

00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,940
around the presentation so the first

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:59,050
thing is the complexity of the website

00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:00,250
well it's its statistics ok based on the

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,349
three hundred projects we've done so far

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,810
but you will probably recognize some

00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:08,380
patterns there there is a very simple

00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:11,469
website like not so much content types

00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:14,320
don't work flow very simple data flow

00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:16,180
well some templates classical small

00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,669
company websites then you have the

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,490
medium sites with more content type with

00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:24,219
some external data sources from xml some

00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:26,349
workflow custom business features maybe

00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:28,479
some data migration and finally we have

00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:30,699
this complex web sites the big one and

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,940
with transactional ecommerce website

00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:37,120
community websites with a lot of content

00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,750
types templates and and data migrations

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,230
in

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:44,800
a external web system like ASAP or at

00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:46,780
them on the other hand we have this

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,420
front-end thing because a lot of drupal

00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:51,340
websites you actually doing teaming so

00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:54,150
we also split them into free we have

00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,530
like standard desktop output blocks and

00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:59,470
internet 10 support Internet Explorer 10

00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:01,360
support only with some chrome safari

00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,280
nothing complicated then we had this

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,290
mobile theme but not for all the

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,180
features and finally we have this for

00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,610
responsive design like a fancy thing

00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,620
like reading your website web browser

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,800
and everything moves and around with

00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:18,280
like nice and advanced gquery animation

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:22,120
so listen so we'll use this f 1 2 3 and

00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:24,430
s want to feel later so remember it so

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,430
the first thing the the guys in England

00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,169
in doing Drupal will do is like set up

00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,870
models there are a lot of models in

00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:33,850
Drupal 20,000 of them so you spend a lot

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:37,210
of time selecting models creating

00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:39,100
content types configuring all of them

00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:41,979
user roles permission rose views

00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,140
everything so it takes a lot of time but

00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:46,030
you don't go into Jeep details at the

00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:50,320
beginning so you'll spend probably some

00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:52,900
couple of days for small sites and more

00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,150
just about the figures those are

00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,460
statistics related to our projects

00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,440
doesn't doesn't mean that it works for

00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,570
everybody but i think that the

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,620
relationship between the three are quite

00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:08,460
okay so well it's complicated to say

00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,900
estimates it's an estimate of estimates

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,419
the second thing is the development

00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:16,210
platform set up many guys forget about

00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:18,160
to put it in their code but you take

00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,710
time to set up redmine user accounts

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,330
mailing lists my sickle if you are

00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,400
running with your websites on like way

00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,160
our you have to also set up their things

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,950
get her gown gitlab whatever so you will

00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:35,580
have to spend time and often you forgot

00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:39,099
to put them in the code the second thing

00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,839
we have to talk is a context this is a

00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:42,789
quite complicated thing because it's

00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:45,040
like a cancer inside your drupal site

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:47,140
because when you talk about context to

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,310
take talk about passed out oh and euro

00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:53,000
setup you have advertisement tagging

00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:55,220
urls page title context microdata

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,570
everything in all those small tasks

00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,120
because it's not complicated to sub

00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,160
8-based i top that out with like take an

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,500
hour but if you multiply this by the

00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:07,190
number of content types and if you add a

00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:09,740
lot of context this this can be really

00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:12,440
painful and take much more time that you

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:18,320
you think it would take for example we

00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:20,360
if I will you give you an example we got

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,790
a website e-commerce website with only

00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,510
32 plates and we asked it to the glider

00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:28,940
guys please provide me the tagging for

00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:30,800
analytics so we was I think like I'm no

00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,290
problem i added three days to do that it

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,220
will be okay and finally we received at

00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:39,860
70 pages taking specification from the

00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,960
client with every single click track

00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,670
down and and and the cart and checkout

00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,380
with different business logic everywhere

00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:48,290
so we spent two weeks during that and

00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,960
again the guys said a it wasn't aspects

00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:55,640
well actually not the specs but we'll

00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:58,430
talk about the change request later then

00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,350
the most important for me I think even

00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:02,480
if if you are like you can leave just

00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,460
after this slide because because the

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,560
templates are actually I think there is

00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,970
a direct correlation between the project

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,190
size and the number of templates of

00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,080
course you have some particular websites

00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,720
with complex business logic or complex

00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:18,200
external systems but again templates for

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,290
me is if you know how to count your

00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:24,200
templates you almost covered half of the

00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:26,660
work and estimate because there is a lot

00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,870
of work on templates if you take a

00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,940
website classical website you will start

00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,100
with sketching with a client you will

00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:36,220
work with this client to sketch the all

00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:40,070
the websites templates like contact form

00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:42,110
sitemap home page article product page

00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:45,050
whatever then you will probably do some

00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:48,440
wire frames to validate it with exact

00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:50,540
proportions and in phones and things and

00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,700
then you had some back-and-forth things

00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,770
with the client and then you have to

00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,690
design these templates and probably you

00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:58,550
will need some static HTML for these

00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:01,310
templates to validate it works on all

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:02,690
responsive and multiply this by if you

00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,110
have a responsive as three back points

00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,180
you

00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,130
bye-bye three and then you have your

00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,959
developer at the end who is doing the

00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:12,470
templates actually creating the DPL

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,660
files and rupal so at the end adding one

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:17,899
templates I think a lot of work of

00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:20,750
course these numbers again depends of

00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:24,589
the complexity of your templates of your

00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:27,170
site but well yell if you have 30

00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:29,240
templates if you have a site which has

00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:36,800
60 templates i think the budget will

00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:39,680
double it's quite good number so next

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,570
point is that a migration it's quite

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,060
complicated subject because it's very

00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:46,279
complicated to estimate if you are

00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,110
running with Drupal to do put that

00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:52,010
immigration it should be ok you have a

00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:55,130
lot of models me great feeds whatever if

00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:59,120
you are running a project with some

00:11:55,130 --> 00:12:01,690
structured data my sickle ms SQL it

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:05,810
should be ok and then if you have this

00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:07,550
website with no only title and HTML

00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:10,610
inside and the guy said please if you

00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:13,810
have the bold put it in I as a teaser if

00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:17,990
you have you ll I put it in this

00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:21,620
multi-line multi entities well it you

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:23,269
will have a lot of pain so usually when

00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,550
you got the air FP you don't have any

00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:27,350
big so much information about the data

00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:32,570
sources so you cannot really estimate

00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:34,730
exactly them but what we've not just is

00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,589
that it's relative depends of the number

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,269
of content types so usually tamo great

00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,860
one content types for example article

00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:42,680
from Drupal to Drupal it will take you

00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,540
one day just to figure out from

00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,670
structured a bit of two three days /

00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:49,220
content type and if you are going from

00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:50,959
HTML don't well I cannot testing that

00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:55,790
you just say to the client will see or

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:57,320
or add some numbers from okay well see

00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,360
but now it's quite complicated because

00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:05,180
you will face a lot of problems with

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:07,220
HTML integration another thing guys who

00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,570
do estimates always forget that it's

00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,930
really complicated is the number of

00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:14,810
deploys because actually when the deploy

00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:17,089
is a crazy thing because it's quite

00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,949
normal it's quite easy well

00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:22,189
we do agile will deploy at each sprint

00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:24,620
it's okay and actually it might be real

00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:26,209
painful thing because depending on the

00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,480
number of deploys you have in the

00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:31,790
project and then in the hosting company

00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:35,300
you'll you're using the deployment be

00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:38,240
right real nightmare I give you an

00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:40,480
example we have a website where the

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,860
hosting company wasn't aware of Drupal

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:47,269
actually wasn't aware of hosting I think

00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:50,360
but but the guys was deployed was

00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:53,149
manually using FTP and uploading the

00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,610
entire website no differential deploy so

00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:57,529
imagine that the guys developers have to

00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:00,889
create features who back on them

00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:02,629
together created a tar file and send

00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:04,189
them and then they deploy manually and

00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:05,749
they forgot all the time they deploy it

00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:08,480
because they have free front end web

00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:11,300
service and they forgot one and random

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,040
errors and everybody calls us saying hey

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,430
guys you did prep and we didn't crack

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:19,160
okay prove okay so depending of your of

00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:21,529
your partner is hosting company the

00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,870
number of deployed it can be really

00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:26,059
costly so usually you will spend like

00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:30,949
half a day with Drupal clouds because

00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:33,620
there are a lot of them now and for

00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:35,179
Capistrano so it's classical hosting

00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,600
company but you automated the deploy

00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:41,439
process you have like a day and also go

00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:44,059
three days but again these numbers

00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:45,769
remember that during a deploy you not

00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:47,389
only have to deploy actually the thing

00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:50,240
but the developers has to create

00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:52,550
features for features doesn't work all

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,829
the time you'll have to export views you

00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:57,050
will have to create model updating you

00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:59,420
will have to put it all together deploy

00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:02,269
test the deploy that's the rollback if

00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:04,220
you want and then deploy actually to

00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:06,740
production of pre-production so it takes

00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,389
time and if you have a deploy each

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:14,990
sprint you'll have to think about this

00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:18,730
time the testing the create well how

00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:23,990
much of you have dedicated test teams

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:27,529
well yeah of course I am wonder why

00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:29,600
developers do bugs actually have some of

00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:31,240
my dear lovers here looking at me but

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,830
well everybody do

00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,440
so that's why we need testing testing

00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:38,820
might be dedicated team or or actually

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,620
your developers doing only tests it

00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,899
doesn't matter but what we noticed is

00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:46,360
that testing is directly related to the

00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:50,350
number of hours of development this is

00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:52,360
kind of empiric number it was all the

00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:56,500
time so this is quite I'm quite sure of

00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:59,070
this estimate I include in this test of

00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:02,020
course not only manual testing but also

00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:04,510
HTML cross browser testing and reaching

00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:07,779
automated tests selenium or simple test

00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:09,820
whatever so if of course it depends of

00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:13,450
the complexity of the website because

00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:15,940
for example if you do ecommerce website

00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:17,320
the developers will spend like two or

00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,709
three or five days during the checkout

00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,870
process but there is a lot of a lot of

00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:24,130
features inside the checkout process you

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,740
will have to test it in different

00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:28,839
scenarios cancel roll back go back and

00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,130
try again so depending of the complexity

00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:32,380
of the website and the business logic

00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:34,560
some business cases might be very easy

00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:37,360
to code and very long to test

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:44,560
import-export things like that take time

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:47,500
because you have many use cases well

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,360
then then you have the management this

00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,750
is again this is very different from one

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,579
client to another basically depends of

00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,500
your organization how you manage the

00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:58,899
project how smart your developers are

00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:01,089
how smart your project managers are how

00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:03,339
is your relationship what we've noticed

00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:07,059
actually is that it's not really related

00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:11,410
to to the project itself it's more

00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:14,050
related to the client um I've got a

00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:16,809
client prism with a social network low

00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:19,540
social network with kind of medium sized

00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:23,380
project and everything was quite okay

00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:26,199
and and it was a nightmare because five

00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:29,140
person knowing nothing about web calling

00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:31,270
all everybody every day and asking

00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:34,390
things like I cannot connect at my site

00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:38,950
at a jegs.com I suggest you table what a

00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:40,990
DX at X that combat don't add and Erebus

00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:43,000
think and say yes not normally it's not

00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,130
running in email and all the time during

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,770
one year it was

00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:48,540
this so for that kind of clients you

00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,820
will need like much more project

00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:53,400
management but usually these figures

00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,500
work quite well again it depends of the

00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,740
size of the project because usually when

00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,260
the project's goes bigger you have more

00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,820
you have to face more people in front of

00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,740
you and the client sighs you have a

00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,800
functional guy the marketing guy the

00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,780
design probably the top management thing

00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,810
so you have like steering committees

00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:18,150
thing so you'll have to spend much more

00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:21,330
time the last thing you have to do quote

00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:24,050
Elsa specifications and actually who

00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:28,980
writes specification for each project

00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:31,980
well that's not enough guys yeah that's

00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,680
yeah I think that's that's that's a big

00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:37,230
error if you don't fry aspects because

00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:39,020
well with all this agile think where we

00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:42,200
don't do specs we do sprints okay but

00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:45,060
actually specification is their only way

00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:48,720
to not lose money on a fixed price

00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:50,610
project because even if you do agile we

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,230
do agile sometimes known with our

00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:55,380
clients but we've right specifications

00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:57,330
print by sprint so we have a quite Bible

00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,340
of the project so when you write

00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:02,400
specification in the most detailed way

00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:05,070
possible the client will never say a it

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,480
was it wasn't my original air FB

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:08,300
whatever you say guys you validated the

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,680
specs once you validated the specs

00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:13,170
everything else out of the specs will be

00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:15,870
an evolution or change request and this

00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:18,120
is quite easy to to discuss because we

00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:20,160
were at a spec he validated it it easier

00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,290
to discuss rather than going back again

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:29,460
and again to the initial rfp and saying

00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:35,640
what was this workflow think so well yes

00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:37,920
again this these numbers are quite well

00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,440
it depends basically on the size of your

00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:43,470
project but really reaching specs is

00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:46,650
quite really important it's the only way

00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:50,580
have you wait you can manage this change

00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:53,070
request item wait we forgot all most

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:55,500
important the features i mean the oldest

00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,760
business logic like makes your website

00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,980
unique and and

00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,590
and different from the others of course

00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:05,010
we've talked about seeing you drupal set

00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:07,560
up things but the features are are quite

00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:10,290
unique well there is no magic rules to

00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,510
estimate features it's like how I think

00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:14,100
you have to split it in small parts the

00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:17,340
more precise you will be in your code

00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,840
the better will be your estimates for

00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,270
example watching that put like three

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,370
days for voting try to think about like

00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:26,190
voting I have to install five star

00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:29,790
watching API set up all the content

00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:31,920
types that are touched by the voting I

00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:34,710
have to theme the five star then I have

00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,140
to create a block with most voted

00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:38,910
content I had to limit and I have to

00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,700
integrate this in my website and I have

00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:43,650
to deploy it so the only feature that

00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,690
seems very easy five star and voting

00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:47,280
actually it's not that easy if you split

00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,590
it in small parts and you think about

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:55,530
how much really I need time to do each

00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:57,300
small part that's this estimate then

00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:00,270
when you do estimates basically you do

00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:02,970
it against the RFP or tender or specs

00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:05,190
and then you will see like you'll

00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:09,420
probably see like everything going from

00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:12,990
one page 1 e-mail RFP going to freehand

00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:15,840
pages RFP well we got all of them and it

00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:18,960
doesn't really matter how much money the

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,600
client habits well does the culture so

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,610
again we splitted this narrow FP into

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,820
three big parts the first one we have

00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:29,970
the user centric RFP so this is the new

00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:32,790
kind of agile think we see in the air FP

00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:35,190
right now guys saying as an admin I can

00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:37,200
create a content type as an admin I can

00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:41,550
as an anonymous user I can go to an

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:44,400
article page and this for 300 pages well

00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:46,710
I don't like this kind of therapy but

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,030
there are some advantages because you

00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:49,650
have a detailed presentation for the

00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:51,990
feature because it described on

00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:53,640
different personas you can really

00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,650
understand how the feature they want to

00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,390
implement work because for example for

00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,730
our workflow problem they will describe

00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:04,200
basin for each role they should describe

00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:06,570
how this work off works but you to

00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,000
create OST made official to understand

00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:10,440
it's the definition of the feature

00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,330
spread it across several

00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,059
use a story so I have to summarize it in

00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:17,519
one piece which might be quite long and

00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:18,960
then you will be have to be very careful

00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,120
with the template accounting because

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,559
usually guys doesn't present some wire

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:27,419
frames so as a user I can see articles

00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:29,759
okay you know you have article templates

00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:32,190
you probably had some homepage but

00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:35,009
that's kind of complicated to count the

00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:37,559
number of templates the second type of

00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:40,559
rfp you have with the page centric ESP

00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:43,080
so you have a bunch of wireframes or

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,269
designs sometimes annotated sometimes

00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:48,870
not alike this is my website please do

00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:51,539
it this is good i think i prefer this

00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:53,820
because actually you it's easy to

00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:57,690
contemplate and you have you reduce your

00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:59,549
risks of misunderstanding and but you

00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,710
will need to be very careful with an all

00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:05,669
the business rules and in the back

00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:08,490
office and and because we got the client

00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:11,340
for example forum real estates websites

00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:14,580
and the little blocks like with promoted

00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:17,279
apartments and actually we put like okay

00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:19,200
five days to do that and what the client

00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,450
actually wanted was much more

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,639
complicated because they wanted like

00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:25,440
very complex business logic depending of

00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:28,470
search result which search result is a

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,480
job searches of using apache solr with

00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:32,460
if you are promoted and if you are a

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,279
partnered near than 50 kilometers then

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:37,259
push this book there well and all this

00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:39,360
all around so you have to be careful

00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:41,730
with these templates only inner peace

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:46,110
and finally we had this feature list

00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:48,509
this is usually whole school okay i want

00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:54,509
watching I want comments I want articles

00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:57,330
I won't homepage do it well it's easy to

00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:59,429
get teachers okay but you have to

00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:01,470
imagine all the context templates SEO

00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:04,110
and all the stuff behind the features

00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:08,129
and the difference between different

00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:11,309
videos might be really important that

00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:13,529
the thing finally had this hidden costs

00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:16,679
because when you are reading the RFP

00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:18,029
many things are not described and again

00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:20,039
if you are wanted to provide a good

00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:23,730
quality job you have to build and

00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:25,800
prepare that so for example

00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:27,960
you have the back office clean up okay

00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:31,170
Drupal 8 looks good i saw the keynote

00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,310
but drupal 7 right now and you have to

00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,780
clean up things because you will not

00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:35,700
present to you to the site

00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,950
administrators and contributors all the

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,530
crappy things with path auto ring or

00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:43,410
whatever so you will probably need to

00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:45,390
spend some time of cleaning up workflow

00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:47,190
notification user permission the client

00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:49,020
usually don't think about that but they

00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:53,100
wanted actually so you have to probably

00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:55,230
add as an option the way I see big zip

00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,510
top is a classical thing how will add

00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:59,430
sick edit or that will be fine and then

00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:01,290
you will see like crappy red things

00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:03,390
climbing inside the your side because

00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:05,100
the guys adding copy paste from war but

00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:08,940
whatever so you'll have else to prepare

00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:11,460
like make the YZ big render exactly like

00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,890
the front end those dozen things and of

00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,350
course you have optimization Drupal is a

00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:20,310
slow CMS by default so you'll have to

00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:23,400
add caching memcache varnish a edge side

00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:25,830
includes probably some CDN and all these

00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,480
together makes time lazy load images

00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:30,480
it's small things but you will spend

00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:36,150
time on it and the client will not think

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:38,670
about it before one thing we've not just

00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:40,940
will lost a lot of projects because we

00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:44,460
were adding all these things inside our

00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:46,830
restaurant response so we was like guys

00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:49,920
in a small company how maybe how the

00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:54,690
hell we make we are more expensive than

00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:56,340
like capgemini it's just why and after

00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,710
that we understood that there is some

00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,900
tricks when you're answering especially

00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:06,180
public RFP to avoid being the most

00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:08,970
expensive the first thing is being the

00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:11,460
most precise possible in your codes at

00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:14,040
the beginning we was like putting 20 or

00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,050
10 lines in our codes and then we ended

00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,750
up with hundreds of lines and our codes

00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:21,840
why because the first thing is it would

00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:24,540
be easier if you win the project to say

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,130
hey guys look there was one line for

00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:30,420
that there is no line for what you

00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:32,580
asking me for sorry and then it's much

00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:35,820
more complicated to discuss for example

00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:37,730
if you say okay theming 25 days and the

00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:41,160
clan said no 22

00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:44,850
okay and by I signed today and say okay

00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:47,910
2220 okay 20 and if you have one

00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:50,580
template sank three hours here home page

00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:52,950
five hours article three hours product

00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:55,770
page four hours at this point four hours

00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:59,490
well you will say four hours for product

00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:01,260
page yes four hours three no four okay

00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:03,150
so it's much easier it's much more

00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,370
complicated to negotiate with you if

00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,809
you're very detailed and precise and the

00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:09,299
other thing is that it shows you are

00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:14,190
like understand his project and not just

00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:17,309
like putting 20 days so then once you

00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:20,460
set up all this bunch of lines in your

00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:22,470
quote take care because you probably

00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,840
will be the most expensive because other

00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:27,270
guys doesn't think about everything and

00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,150
we will not put everything so put

00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:32,520
options put everything as options back

00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:34,410
office options everything that is not

00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,750
ask it directly in there he put as

00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:38,460
options and then you will have the

00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,169
chance to explain to the client one why

00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,540
you put this option and why he needs

00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:44,340
that so will enable the discussion and

00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:47,370
then you enable the contact with a

00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,780
client so then you can maybe win the

00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,910
project because you are talking to each

00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,679
other and you show to the client that

00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:55,830
you understand his needs and you think

00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:59,100
more than just what he asked it for and

00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:02,220
of course in the others there will be a

00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,900
lot of in clear feature and you will not

00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,690
have the possibility to discuss with the

00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:09,900
client before the release of your answer

00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:12,540
so take the low estimate and explain

00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,280
exactly what you will do don't from what

00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,770
he asked for workflow don't put workflow

00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,990
of three days j workflow using rules

00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:21,240
model with free roles and no

00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:23,580
notification with one dashboard three

00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,010
days so when he asked for five

00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:29,220
dashboards and five roses sorry guys we

00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:32,910
wrote freely so it more precise less

00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:36,860
problems or you can do like this some

00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:40,260
big ones we know that they do that you

00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:41,910
underestimate the bill and hope to get

00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,679
money from the run this is a very

00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:45,510
dangerous thing we don't do that at

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,940
addax but i know some companies will do

00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:50,130
that because to win the client they sign

00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,830
the build they lose money on the build

00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,380
and they know

00:28:50,830 --> 00:29:00,700
that will have support and MCO and

00:28:53,380 --> 00:29:04,539
things like that so the build phase well

00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:06,820
now we now what to estimate we now how

00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:09,370
we know well we try to know how to

00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,809
answer the RFP now we we want the

00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,730
project that's funny and that the

00:29:10,809 --> 00:29:14,710
problem starts because then you can

00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:18,669
really lose money because if you don't

00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:21,399
win you probably don't lose it so the

00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:23,409
first thing is to measure the time

00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:25,480
because well we're doing drupal shops

00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:28,000
we're running drupal shops we pay

00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,039
salaries salaries is money based on time

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,929
some of the more time you spend the more

00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:35,019
money you lose so you have to measure it

00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:38,440
if you don't measure it you will not be

00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:40,990
able to control anything so first thing

00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,610
is it set up time tracking software read

00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:45,730
mine does it for us but you can use

00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:48,070
whatever you want and and sit and ask

00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:50,350
everybody time logs it's like just

00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:53,710
mandatory everybody who is using Time

00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:56,200
Logs actually here well yeah good well

00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:58,840
you need to time log everywhere each

00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,809
project managers everybody and usually

00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:04,389
what you should do is one line in your

00:30:01,809 --> 00:30:07,419
initial quotation should should be

00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:09,760
related to one task in red nine and then

00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:13,299
all the issues like bugs and evolution

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,159
should be attached to this super task so

00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:17,980
everybody looks time and at the end you

00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:20,740
can say the difference between your

00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:23,529
initial condition and actually what the

00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:26,049
guys that did so not only you will see

00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:28,059
if you are losing money in the project

00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:29,649
but you will see where and then you can

00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:31,720
check out with guys who was responsible

00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:35,980
this task why we spend much more time

00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:39,279
that we shouldn't what we also create is

00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:41,710
a project backlog with on the left my

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:44,049
initial code and then the real task on

00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:46,870
the right so we can say configure

00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:49,240
certain types it seems be like we lose

00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:50,950
time on that but actually this is a very

00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,809
good way of control because as the

00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:55,480
developers will fill these things

00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:57,429
actually they can warn you saying guys

00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,990
we are going out of estimates because

00:30:57,429 --> 00:31:00,940
the project manager cannot think about

00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:03,710
everything on the project he's like

00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:06,200
doing client developers testers

00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:07,940
problems and he will not be having an

00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,429
eye on everything these kind of things

00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,440
will help you and then we have / sprint

00:31:10,429 --> 00:31:17,029
backlog with estimates and the real

00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:19,789
hours that was done so to sum up with

00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:21,799
this everybody must lock time that's a

00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:24,220
mandatory you should keep the link

00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:27,020
between initial code and the next and

00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:28,730
one thing we noticed is that before the

00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:31,370
estimates wasn't shared with developers

00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:33,590
we was doing like we do estimates we'd

00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:35,570
give task and then we like they see us

00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:38,029
read like our guy's he should speed up

00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:39,890
they understand that we are out but we

00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:41,450
didn't share that now we share the

00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:44,090
estimates with everybody in the project

00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:46,190
every single guy working in the project

00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:48,919
knows about the estimates of the wall

00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:52,279
project it helps like to have the spirit

00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:54,559
of control and you have to stick to the

00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:56,750
plan if you set up time logs and

00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:00,320
specification do it even when you have

00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:04,010
panic that if you have panic stick to

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:07,520
the plan don't don't cancel time log

00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:09,799
don't stop the specification it's it's

00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,919
better to have been late and explain to

00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:14,750
the client you are been late than to

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:19,520
completely destroy your process inside

00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:21,409
your company then the credit this is the

00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:24,679
way we found out how to manage an

00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:27,020
evolution change request so imagine the

00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:29,390
fact that you have answered the very

00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:32,210
very detailed way your quotation you

00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:34,370
created your specification for each

00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:37,880
sprint everything is covered and then

00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:40,370
the clients ask something more so the

00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:44,720
good thing is to set up some kind of

00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:47,360
shared xls file with the client where

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,360
you put the feature he asked the

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,240
estimates and and and the total at the

00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:56,990
end this to avoid the idea is to avoid

00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,549
sending bills like please sign these

00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:00,830
please sign me this is can be like

00:32:58,549 --> 00:33:03,049
harassment during the project 300 here

00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:05,000
200 the small amounts small numbers but

00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:06,409
here is receiving this please sign

00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,960
please sign please and it's not okay so

00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:11,149
set up a policy with him with your

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,639
clients and we are OK by mail and then

00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:16,070
you have this control shared doc and he

00:33:13,639 --> 00:33:16,999
sees the total number of amounts and at

00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:19,639
the end of the project you

00:33:16,999 --> 00:33:22,059
just build a total so he's not

00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:26,989
frustrated he's not I think it's better

00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:29,149
and what we also introduced since this

00:33:26,989 --> 00:33:31,159
year is a stop day in the middle of each

00:33:29,149 --> 00:33:33,499
project we stop everything like for half

00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:36,409
a day or per day and looking ok let's

00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:38,809
like check what we have to do and what

00:33:36,409 --> 00:33:41,479
we still have how much burn we how much

00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:44,029
money we burn so far it's very important

00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:46,789
that everybody stops and speak by skype

00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:49,459
in a room whatever about this like let's

00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:51,589
go with the middle what what we have

00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:54,679
still to do and how much time is spent

00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:56,419
because it when you are doing the

00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:58,819
project your own sprint sprint release

00:33:56,419 --> 00:34:01,159
doing code bugs and you are not like you

00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:07,549
don't take step apart to check out the

00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:09,639
problems finally what really makes your

00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:13,069
project going wild is this never-ending

00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:15,019
acceptance be you'd like yeah yeah we

00:34:13,069 --> 00:34:16,849
finished like eighty five percent on

00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:19,879
ninety-five percent of the features okay

00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:22,789
and then the project I have acceptance

00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:25,669
content accidents problem bugs and still

00:34:22,789 --> 00:34:29,329
and that lasts for months and this is

00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:31,819
what makes you lose money you should

00:34:29,329 --> 00:34:33,589
define at the very beginning of the

00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:35,990
project the acceptance period of time

00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:38,329
and and you should be very very careful

00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:40,279
with the client very strong with the

00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:42,289
client saying guys you have to ax you

00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:44,779
have to test the website you have to

00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:46,579
report bugs be careful you have only two

00:34:44,779 --> 00:34:50,119
weeks three weeks one month three months

00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:53,359
whatever but you have a fixed timeline

00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:55,629
it doesn't mean that the you will have

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:58,759
to solve all the bugs during this period

00:34:55,629 --> 00:35:01,309
but it shows to the client and to your

00:34:58,759 --> 00:35:03,049
team that you have a fixed time for the

00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:05,059
acceptance and then the site will

00:35:03,049 --> 00:35:12,349
probably go live and then you have this

00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:15,890
guarantee period so you must define this

00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:18,950
time yes and also you have to define

00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:21,200
with the client what blocks the release

00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,940
that's something really important when

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,349
you start your your your acceptance

00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:27,769
period you have to talk with a client

00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:30,190
saying okay guy please when you open the

00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:33,670
bag you put blocker only bug

00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:35,440
bugs that actually blocks life so in

00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:38,470
this way when you define this through

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,920
with a client he is ok to go live with

00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:44,349
some bugs which wish he could be

00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,849
relevant with an acceptance period when

00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:48,579
you didn't define this blocker issue

00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:51,040
definition with them so once you set up

00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:52,839
that he understand that blocker means we

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,990
stop everything and we solve this issue

00:35:52,839 --> 00:36:01,599
and it's blocking for life so it helps

00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:04,420
to time box the acceptance also you have

00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:07,240
to decline our very scared about what

00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:08,770
happens after the day we released so you

00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,930
have to explain him this guarantee

00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:12,760
peeled I don't know your contracts how

00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:14,980
they put three months six months two

00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,829
months whatever but you have to explain

00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:20,260
you don't worry we'll be still here to

00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:22,599
making go life because your guarantee

00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:25,359
period you're probably three months or

00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:27,819
whatever is by contract so you know that

00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:30,160
you have to go live as soon as possible

00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:31,869
it's better for you so you have to count

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:37,000
down the client explain in detail what

00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:39,250
happens during the warranty PU well the

00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,440
last thing is the support and

00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:45,520
maintenance some private joke for French

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:48,700
guys support and maintenance is we

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:52,630
notice that you lose the project stops

00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:54,849
like it's going life use you was you you

00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:58,390
he was paid for the for the project it

00:36:54,849 --> 00:37:00,640
was okay but you don't stop to losing

00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:02,920
money because the client will still call

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,829
you I don't know how to create an

00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:08,950
article oh please I think everything is

00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:11,050
broken on homepage and usually its

00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:13,270
problems of contribution maybe some bugs

00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:15,520
but usually it's some kind of support

00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:17,109
tasks and it's very complicated for

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,030
especially for a small company working

00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:21,280
with big clients since one year on the

00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:22,480
project like saying also you cannot call

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,260
me you don't have a support contract

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:28,869
sorry bye well it's it's not possible so

00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:31,660
to avoid this kind of discussion at the

00:37:28,869 --> 00:37:33,220
end of the project again talk about

00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:35,200
support in the middle of the beginning

00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:37,599
of the project saying guys we have a

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,000
support policy by ticket fixed price

00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:43,240
whatever but we had this support think

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,960
and this is for you to help you we want

00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,770
to take it

00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:49,930
take talk again during the project and

00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:54,040
intensify this box before the release

00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:55,570
date because if you if you start talking

00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,940
about support at the end of the project

00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:59,589
he said like it will be like a little

00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,750
bit complicated to take to talk with the

00:37:59,589 --> 00:38:04,930
glide about support of course you can

00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:06,640
also go with some acquire or comments

00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:08,740
guys support whatever but if you

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,930
probably do support on your own projects

00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:17,740
you will need that ticketing system or

00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:19,599
whatever so well that's it so well if

00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:22,800
you have some questions we are welcome

00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,800
I'll try to answer them

00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:35,970
like you have actually you have the mag

00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:39,060
microsoft would be easier if everybody's

00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:42,360
can hear you but okay yeah thank you I

00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:44,250
have two questions first on the

00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,830
functional specification into what

00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:48,900
detail do you go you talked about being

00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:52,950
able to point to the functional spec and

00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:54,330
say hey this wasn't in there so that's

00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:56,190
going to cost extra that's going to be a

00:38:54,330 --> 00:39:00,090
change order and the problem that we run

00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:03,420
into my company is that often the

00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:05,369
functional specification is too detailed

00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:07,320
for the client to understand so they end

00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:09,060
up signing off on it but really not

00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,070
fully understanding what they're signing

00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:12,780
you know there was three content types

00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:14,400
well what's a Content I you know they

00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,050
don't they might not know yeah and

00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,450
that's that's true actually actually

00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:20,070
this is a technical specs we split it

00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:23,340
like functional it's really like blocks

00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:25,320
or the wireframes and yeah the level of

00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:27,480
detail the specification is quite

00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:30,150
complicated that's why on big projects

00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,100
we try to split down the specification

00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:34,320
two sprints and propose to the client

00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:37,050
specification before the spin so they

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,810
don't have like 500 pages but our usual

00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:44,490
specs are like 6 500 pages for big

00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:46,200
project you have to explain we spent

00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:48,420
half a day for each spring to explain

00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:51,359
the specs and read them with a client so

00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:52,980
if he has questions he asked us so we

00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,960
make sure that he actually understands

00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:58,380
but again we asked to sign because

00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,900
otherwise well you cannot and if you

00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:04,170
don't put enough details then you will

00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:05,820
always have some extra discussions which

00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:09,090
are not very good in during the project

00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:11,369
too so well explain the specs and split

00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:13,050
them in small parts I think content

00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:16,020
types it's quite easy to understand for

00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:20,700
some clients well if you explain show

00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:25,410
him and yeah yeah I had a one other

00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:27,480
question so when when you talked about

00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:29,760
you guys use red mind for your ticketing

00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:33,030
system we use open atrium and we

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,080
actually create accounts for our clients

00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:37,290
and they're actually in there in the

00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:39,210
issue cues you know resolving the

00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:41,609
tickets and responding and you know we

00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,829
ask for their feedback but that's some

00:40:41,609 --> 00:40:43,269
time

00:40:41,829 --> 00:40:45,940
problematic not having a sort of

00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:47,859
separate internal issue queue and sort

00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:50,369
of an external saw ye how you guys

00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:53,799
handle that way it's a problematic

00:40:50,369 --> 00:40:55,690
because then you know we like to be open

00:40:53,799 --> 00:40:57,309
and transparent with our clients but

00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:58,779
sometimes you know there are certain

00:40:57,309 --> 00:41:01,599
things you might not want the client to

00:40:58,779 --> 00:41:04,359
see or you know just sort of being able

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,279
to you know have issue cues that are

00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:07,749
sort of more technical and maybe

00:41:06,279 --> 00:41:09,849
separate from the client but then also

00:41:07,749 --> 00:41:12,400
you have to communicate with the client

00:41:09,849 --> 00:41:14,440
as well so it's a tough battle well we

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,989
use only one system that's what often

00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,430
ask it when we work for some agencies

00:41:16,989 --> 00:41:21,309
like subcontractors they asked us from

00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:23,170
separate read minds but when we do

00:41:21,309 --> 00:41:24,999
indirectly like eighty eighty-five

00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:27,219
percent of our clients I'm direct we

00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:29,140
always be all everybody in the project

00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:30,640
everybody in the red mine and usually

00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:32,170
guys who has not technically not though

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,549
he has not they are not interested they

00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:37,900
never log in you see them like never

00:41:33,549 --> 00:41:40,269
looking okay well being transparent and

00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:43,180
even if you have problems it's a good

00:41:40,269 --> 00:41:45,160
thing because what scares out the client

00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:48,099
when you stay we are be late for example

00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:49,690
he can understand your being late but he

00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:51,459
wants to understand why and how to avoid

00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:54,039
this so if you see all these people

00:41:51,459 --> 00:41:55,269
working nights and days and login and

00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:56,920
commute if he even if he doesn't

00:41:55,269 --> 00:41:58,930
understand he see the activity of the

00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,380
project so he knows that you work hard

00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:03,999
on the resolving problems so we offer

00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:06,789
all access to the red mind everybody

00:42:03,999 --> 00:42:08,979
sees everything there it's quite easier

00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:10,509
to explain things like look it's inside

00:42:08,979 --> 00:42:12,699
there they are there if you don't care

00:42:10,509 --> 00:42:14,469
you don't you don't look inside but it's

00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:19,839
easier I think from my point of view I

00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:21,369
know I taco from go gorilla the

00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,170
Netherlands thank you for your

00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:26,739
presentation I think you did a really

00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:29,109
good effort using a statistical data to

00:42:26,739 --> 00:42:31,089
solve this problem and as you said

00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:33,099
seventy percent of the ICT projects in

00:42:31,089 --> 00:42:34,539
all our countries we can name one of you

00:42:33,099 --> 00:42:36,789
usually from the government they're very

00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:37,959
good at this that fail and I think this

00:42:36,789 --> 00:42:40,660
is one of the reasons why there's so

00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:43,959
many people here because it's not you

00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:45,789
know or the tech eyes and we can manage

00:42:43,959 --> 00:42:48,519
this but but real good project

00:42:45,789 --> 00:42:50,019
management and a good method of solving

00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:54,219
this issue which is very important for

00:42:50,019 --> 00:42:55,170
any project to succeed so you've done

00:42:54,219 --> 00:42:57,270
this exercise by

00:42:55,170 --> 00:43:00,240
making these estimations do you have

00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:04,109
data on using this method for

00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:08,460
estimations and real project data and

00:43:04,109 --> 00:43:10,170
the Delta data yes I did not yeah so

00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:14,190
with the Delta between what we estimated

00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:16,559
the real numbers yeah and my fundamental

00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:19,049
question is especially for s3 projects

00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:21,589
we do a lot of this can you really

00:43:19,049 --> 00:43:25,619
estimate in front because I saw a lot of

00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:28,349
15 plus you know yeah I know migrations

00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:31,230
that take like weeks so can you really

00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:35,660
make an estimation beforehand of how

00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:38,880
much work it takes to a project well

00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:41,400
usually what happens you can do real

00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,730
estimates like how wrong they will be

00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,230
that the question actually is every

00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:50,400
estimates are good is teammates at the

00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:52,829
beginning yeah so well that the

00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,079
narration is a good question Mike my

00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:57,390
question is should we do this like

00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:59,640
aren't we going down the rabbit hole and

00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:02,579
shouldn't we just move this to the past

00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:05,010
and go to a much more agile way of

00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:08,609
contracting which we did two years ago

00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:10,140
my life has become much better my

00:44:08,609 --> 00:44:12,089
developers life has become much better

00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:16,020
well I can our clients are much more

00:44:12,089 --> 00:44:18,510
satisfied yeah and I see you're taking

00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:20,309
like sprints and backlogs and you're

00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:23,099
slowly moving into this edge away but

00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:25,710
but if it if you would take the step and

00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:29,160
lose the specifications go to a gel

00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:30,960
design we can really do much better

00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:34,079
projects that are on time that are in

00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:37,049
budget and have a really good quality

00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,900
just we have this flexible scope yeah I

00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:42,240
totally agree that that's in theory in

00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,849
practical it's it's the truth the only

00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:48,210
thing is like how to explain I know that

00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:50,760
nothing Europe it's quite easier to to

00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:54,000
make this agile thing in South Europe or

00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:56,130
in US or in France for example if you

00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,520
have a tender with like half a million

00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:00,750
tender everybody will have to answer

00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,670
fixed budget they don't want to hear

00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:04,890
about like we'll see like agile will

00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:05,890
adjust the budget no it's just it's not

00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:08,080
about the

00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:09,700
the thing if you if you say this you do

00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,950
not understand a job because as I worked

00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,630
with a fixed budget so you can promise

00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:16,120
your clients a fixed budget fixed time

00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:17,320
frame just not not to fix go so every

00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,300
time somebody's talking about fixed

00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,160
price they don't understand all edgell

00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:23,350
projects are fixed price and this is the

00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:25,450
thing we should sell our clients you get

00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:27,310
a fixed price you get a fixed deadline

00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:28,780
and you get really good quality we just

00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:30,250
cannot make the problem what you will

00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:32,440
get yeah but the perimeter then it's not

00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:33,940
fixed this is a tough sale i'm not i'm

00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,830
not saying this is easy because the

00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:38,230
trust is very important here you need a

00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:40,030
good track record but if you can make

00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:42,370
this case and if we all should do this

00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:44,500
like don't promise these things you

00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:46,180
cannot promise there's no way you can

00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,920
promise an integration with a third

00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,780
party tool beforehand this isn't this

00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,940
like even if you document it like 200

00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:54,310
pages you'll still end up with things

00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:56,110
you cannot expect beforehand I mean why

00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:58,090
not stop this all together lawyers

00:45:56,110 --> 00:46:00,220
aren't you know saying like okay I'm

00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:01,480
going to do this for ten thousand euros

00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:03,120
beforehand know they say well we're just

00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,620
going to do the project and we'll see

00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:07,450
yeah the problem is that you have a lot

00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:09,910
of like you don't see a decline before

00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:12,040
the RFP answers so you will write down

00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:14,020
yes we'll do that but you then we'll ask

00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:16,060
like confirm that this is included in

00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:18,760
the perimeter and you don't have even a

00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:20,470
call will decline before so you're not

00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,480
beat for that kind of projects well

00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:24,790
there are a lot of that like setting a

00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,110
bigger FP 500-page you don't have the

00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:27,760
permission to communicate with the

00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:29,920
client before you have to ask questions

00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:33,130
by mail that they send to all that and

00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,750
all this business and then they asked to

00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:36,730
confirm the perimeter the exact that yes

00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:39,250
I will do that yes I will do that yes

00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:41,050
these are not the clients we will take

00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:42,700
and ya know because they're too risky

00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:44,410
and you know so I'm just saying there's

00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:46,780
there is an alternative and I really

00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:48,340
liked your effort on doing data analysis

00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:49,360
and trying to make conclusions and we

00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,980
should and we should do all the time

00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:53,410
logging but I think there's a much more

00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:55,330
better yes a way of doing it I hope all

00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:58,440
the grades will move to that well we

00:46:55,330 --> 00:47:00,610
should all do it I mean let's start

00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:03,250
thank you you meant you mentioned about

00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:04,540
stop dies yeah do you share the fact

00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:06,610
that you have stopped days with your

00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:09,880
clients and you ever use it as an

00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:11,740
opportunity to assess VSS acquire that

00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,780
maybe go back with yeah that's that the

00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:16,180
scope analysis or workshops or discovery

00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:18,120
workshops I i if you can place that

00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:19,569
music light is quite very good

00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,759
unfortunately on

00:47:19,569 --> 00:47:23,829
on many RFP you have like one victory

00:47:21,759 --> 00:47:26,289
answer and even you don't have the time

00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:28,239
to set up this workshop we will will set

00:47:26,289 --> 00:47:32,680
up this workshop for very big projects

00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:34,900
but even these discovery workshops the

00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:36,369
scope analysis is it still estimates

00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:38,109
because you still can discover many

00:47:36,369 --> 00:47:40,690
problems within within the project but

00:47:38,109 --> 00:47:42,789
yeah that's definitely the we do all we

00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:44,859
try to do all the time the scope

00:47:42,789 --> 00:47:45,940
analysis with with some water you may

00:47:44,859 --> 00:47:47,799
have misunderstood the question I was

00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:51,549
talking about to stop the stopped I that

00:47:47,799 --> 00:47:55,660
you mentioned very the stopped i scoped

00:47:51,549 --> 00:47:59,229
guided the stop okay stop day yes sorry

00:47:55,660 --> 00:48:01,809
yeah yeah with the stopped I do you let

00:47:59,229 --> 00:48:04,359
clients know that that's in and do you

00:48:01,809 --> 00:48:06,069
ever use that no I he needs more and no

00:48:04,359 --> 00:48:08,019
no the stubbly is more internally with

00:48:06,069 --> 00:48:09,940
the team saying okay guys are we running

00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:12,400
out of limits or not it's just in

00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:14,140
internal to check out everything review

00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,999
the specs review what we've done and

00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:17,619
review what remains to be done so it's

00:48:15,999 --> 00:48:21,069
like arias teammate in the middle of the

00:48:17,619 --> 00:48:23,499
project for us just to how to know how

00:48:21,069 --> 00:48:27,640
to adapt our or behavior add more days

00:48:23,499 --> 00:48:29,709
on offered feature or or stop down and

00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,239
slow down with offer features me more

00:48:29,709 --> 00:48:32,709
careful with evolution and change

00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:38,859
requests just in the middle of projects

00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:40,209
stop and look inside your numbers I want

00:48:38,859 --> 00:48:41,829
to say thank you that you're sharing

00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:45,309
this knowledge that was I think that

00:48:41,829 --> 00:48:47,440
this is the key for giving better

00:48:45,309 --> 00:48:50,799
estimates just to share our knowledge

00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,690
how how you do it how how did thank you

00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:54,880
and then I have a couple of questions

00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:57,609
the first one I will try to be fast the

00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,949
the first one in your company where is

00:48:57,609 --> 00:49:02,949
then between bug fixing face the

00:48:59,949 --> 00:49:06,069
acceptance phase and starting the

00:49:02,949 --> 00:49:08,499
support well when the when the site goes

00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:10,690
live actually that's it's what's kind of

00:49:08,499 --> 00:49:12,759
good late if everybody see that well

00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:15,069
even if on some project life is not like

00:49:12,759 --> 00:49:16,599
but before life where I work faxing

00:49:15,069 --> 00:49:19,569
acceptance period and then once we've

00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:21,279
once we've gone live we stopped the

00:49:19,569 --> 00:49:22,970
support and warranty period but you

00:49:21,279 --> 00:49:24,620
mention something like

00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:28,940
the site only with fixing of the

00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:32,210
critical books or issues and fixing of

00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:36,080
the rest issues when the site is life

00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:38,690
yes and all these books goes in the

00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:40,580
support case yeah when actually this is

00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:42,770
the only thing this is because the

00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:45,230
acceptance if you are late the

00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:47,030
acceptance may go very far away but you

00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:49,550
if you make except your clients going

00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:52,430
live then by contract your garage peeled

00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:54,620
is fixed in the time so well it's quite

00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:56,420
easy then to discuss sign guys we are

00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:58,880
three months after the release there are

00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:01,970
still a couple of bugs but now we have

00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:04,880
to signing MCO or a support contract for

00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:09,050
going so it's just Jerick things thank

00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:11,810
you on one more question how do you

00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:13,790
estimate the third-party integrations I

00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:16,130
know that this is something like there's

00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:19,400
no matter about this but how you do it

00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:21,620
well well it's usually depends of these

00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,750
third-party integrations very large or

00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:25,790
you have data sources of content then

00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:28,190
usually you have to check out by content

00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:30,440
type like if you import events from an

00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:32,930
external system check out the system if

00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:35,180
it is documented if it is a standard

00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:36,800
protocol it's quite easy you want you

00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:38,960
check out how much time you need with

00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,150
feeds to integrate this content type if

00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,670
this is sa p for example for an

00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:45,770
e-commerce website well you have to

00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:47,960
check out how much interaction web

00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:50,240
services you have to call well going to

00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,770
split into details well this is kind of

00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,270
features well you have to split in the

00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:55,190
details and check out this because it's

00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:57,040
so different you know external data

00:50:55,190 --> 00:51:01,670
systems well and my last question oh

00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:03,380
sorry guys really the first 1a how you

00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:06,410
share this knowledge in your company

00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:08,780
because I see that your yeah smart guy

00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:12,380
but but Caillou shared this knowledge in

00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:14,570
oh well we we have these estimates

00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:17,030
uploaded in redmond in the wiki with all

00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:19,760
with Google Docs with all estimators

00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:22,220
share with all guys in working in the

00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:26,060
projects I mean knowledge of estimating

00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:28,100
ah well we will talk a lot with the

00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:29,300
project actually estimates initial

00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:31,400
estimates are done by me but then

00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:34,250
project managers do all the requests and

00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:36,290
estimates so well we we talked a lot

00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:39,250
that we don't have any process of change

00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:42,560
yeah well so we talk like this wiki yeah

00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:44,060
problem and thank you for the

00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:48,170
presentation is excellent and some

00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:50,540
really good jokes I wasn't sure if it

00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:53,690
was about the art of estimating audio of

00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:54,620
replying to rfps because one of the

00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:56,870
points that you made at the beginning

00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:59,270
was that senior people tend to do the

00:51:56,870 --> 00:52:02,690
estimations and junior people do the

00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:04,700
work and the principal in agile that the

00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:07,250
people doing the work of the people that

00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:09,170
should be doing the estimating yes so

00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:11,480
that's true but that's that's exactly

00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:13,400
but if you receive again and like when

00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,710
how do you win projects sometimes guys

00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,420
call in and then you discuss and then

00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:20,720
you set up the project and then but

00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:22,610
actually what happens in in in France

00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:26,000
for example I don't know in the US but

00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:27,950
in Francis you receiving 300 pages RFP

00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,260
and you have two weeks to answer saying

00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:31,910
how good you are how good your guys are

00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:34,430
how much it cost that you confirm that

00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:36,590
everything is inside and then if I send

00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:39,380
this in French to my developers who not

00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:42,320
all speak French they will spend like

00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:45,770
hours to do that so the problem is that

00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:48,080
if I asked to the dreamer to estimate

00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:51,080
the templates and to the developer

00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:53,480
estimate teachers then then we'll

00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:56,000
probably have to spend like five weeks

00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:58,940
to estimate because so we need to go

00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,950
fast and that's why usually guys senior

00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:02,690
in senior position do the estimates

00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:04,400
because they know how to understand what

00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:07,070
the client actually wants behind the

00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:09,440
lines the developers probably will not

00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:12,050
see all these tricks inside the Arab

00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,810
village that are not detailedly explain

00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:17,000
so this is why i don't think that

00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:18,590
actually developers actually developers

00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,590
are very good and estimates when they

00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:23,840
know exactly what to do but on the stage

00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:26,180
of the air FP nobody knows exactly what

00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:28,340
to do to you have to project your RFP

00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:30,590
into a website with everything splitted

00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:34,070
out so this kind of complicated job and

00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:36,590
it takes time for for developers who are

00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:40,160
actually developing other projects well

00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:41,750
that's why we do this way seems to me

00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,210
you might be of the best best of both

00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:47,270
worlds you you're using read mine you're

00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:47,920
creating high level epics for everything

00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:49,990
you've put in the

00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,660
whoa and then developers are having to

00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:54,130
break that down into tasks yeah and are

00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:55,930
they doing the estimating as they break

00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:58,119
that down and you go down more detail

00:53:55,930 --> 00:54:00,130
yeah and once they did this estimate one

00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:02,589
so well in the build phase that is this

00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:06,040
estimates we are able to check out oh

00:54:02,589 --> 00:54:08,079
 we like five days for in our

00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:11,010
initial code and the developers put like

00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:14,170
25 days what happens so we can dig into

00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:16,270
the project manager spot this out can

00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:18,490
jiggle well guys maybe misunderstanding

00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:22,030
on scope we can talk with the client to

00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:23,589
raise a little bit estimates or or slow

00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:25,900
down developer saying we don't need all

00:54:23,589 --> 00:54:27,270
that things inside so this is a good way

00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:32,680
to check out where the problems are

00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:36,430
thank you hi there I'm Gretchen from

00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:38,970
Drupal squad and often times when

00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:42,099
delivering estimates to clients I get a

00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:44,470
common response of they get out there

00:54:42,099 --> 00:54:46,720
red pen and they say oh I will do

00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:49,839
project management or no we will do key

00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:54,430
way or I will do content management

00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:58,270
strategy do you a walk away from those

00:54:54,430 --> 00:55:00,430
bids or do you be have a formula that

00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:02,200
you apply to your estimates that absorb

00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:06,220
the inefficiencies when that happens on

00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:09,730
a project uh not sure I get the question

00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:12,700
exactly and so a client decides to do

00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:14,829
one of the roles themselves yeah oh yeah

00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:17,079
you want to drive hands on decoder you

00:55:14,829 --> 00:55:21,359
mean it's not the code but project

00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:21,359
management or business analysis

00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:34,860
no no this is it somebody get these play

00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:38,190
division where the client decides to

00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:42,660
play the role of project management of a

00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:46,290
project manager or a BA do you accept

00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:48,780
those bids well or do you build in

00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:50,660
additional time for in it we always add

00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:53,910
additional project manager because I

00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:56,010
can't remember any of my client or maybe

00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:58,320
a couple of them like they're able to

00:55:56,010 --> 00:56:01,470
manage actually external developers

00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:03,390
located far away and again the problem

00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:05,340
is that you've set up processes inside

00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:07,440
your company you have like your femurs

00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:08,910
otherwise don't healthy males we have

00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,030
only we do for example we don't this

00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:13,440
fixed static HTML before doing

00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:15,900
templating all those guys doing a

00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,510
different way so when you have a new

00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:20,670
project manager like external they will

00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:22,590
apply his methods and then so well

00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:26,220
that's we always add the project manager

00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:27,830
so do you have a basic percentage that

00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:30,360
you work with there is it case by case

00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:33,390
well its case by case of course because

00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:36,330
well again if the client is a tech guy

00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:38,940
was a good team and it's a small project

00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:41,130
we add lower figures if the guy is like

00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:44,430
marketing department with the crazy

00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:46,740
ideas and no idea of text and there is a

00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:48,390
very big project we had like twenty five

00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:49,530
percent of project management well it

00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:51,570
depends of the size of the project

00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:53,520
because if we small project you have

00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:54,660
only one guy in front of you with a big

00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:58,320
project you have 10 of them and

00:56:54,660 --> 00:57:02,120
everybody's talking and arguing him so

00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:05,190
well we have more Pearson thank you

00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:08,160
thank you for your talk it was a lot of

00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:10,590
interesting facts and statistics however

00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:12,840
I have a couple of concerns and the most

00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:17,370
important is it if we are talking about

00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:20,820
s 2 and s free project cited by you I

00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:23,940
wonder if you have a chance to see how

00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:28,200
the project size curly in numbers you

00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:30,570
provide it relate to team size because

00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:33,540
developing the projects with two or

00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:34,770
three engineers in the end and with the

00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:37,290
team of 10

00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:38,910
of 15 if we are talking about big

00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:40,800
projects it's a big challenge and

00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:42,990
usually there is a lot of other heads

00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:45,900
which should be estimated pretty well

00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:47,850
yeah but well that's the same if the

00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:49,440
project is big probably the team is

00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:52,290
bigger than the then you have this

00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:55,170
overhead yeah that's right and and and I

00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:57,540
would say that the even most important

00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:59,820
is also the client type it's it's

00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:01,410
subjective so subjective I you cannot

00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:03,510
decide like you are a good glad you're a

00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:05,880
bad line but you know all of you like

00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:07,650
know this this this complicated client

00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:10,230
that cannot understand anything and

00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:12,000
don't want just cannot understand the

00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:14,760
agile they don't want to understand the

00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,100
specification in changing every time and

00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:21,540
then more technical organized island so

00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:23,630
I think yes of course the estimates

00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:25,860
based on the size of the project

00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:27,930
depending of the size of your team a

00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:30,030
bigger project is probably bigger the

00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:32,220
team is so yes of course there's

00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:35,850
overhead though I I try to put these

00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:38,310
numbers based on the size of the website

00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:41,730
but you can just replace size of a bite

00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:44,430
size of the team well okay thank you and

00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:48,060
one more small point about specification

00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:49,980
you said that you're trying to write

00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:53,010
specification and whenever a project

00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:55,140
however who's paying for this work the

00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:57,660
client is paying because we put what I

00:58:55,140 --> 00:59:00,840
with specification a what will you do if

00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:03,990
clients you show to your estimation

00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:06,810
where there is a lot of numbers well

00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:08,940
descriptive stories then clients ahead

00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:10,530
and don't need estimation I don't need

00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:13,980
specification I don't want to pay well

00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:15,930
we split that you actually answer is X

00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:18,930
psi well we don't need specification

00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:21,150
actually well you need the immunity they

00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:22,620
say i don't want to pay it ah well is

00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:24,630
this important for you not for me well

00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:26,280
this is well it's important for me but

00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:28,110
it's also documentation if you can't

00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:30,000
explain like a guy if you will don't

00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:32,580
want to refuse to stop work with us

00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,680
after one two three years you will have

00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:36,330
a complete bible of your project and

00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:39,870
then you have like twenty percent off

00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:41,630
and it's okay thank you thank you okay

00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:45,100
we're running a fine thank you very much

00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:47,650
yeah I guess

00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:50,680
more like first of all things thanks for

00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:54,100
your presentation and opinion but I

00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:57,400
would also like to join to measured

00:59:54,100 --> 01:00:01,110
Island guy yeah but I wonder wonder

00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:03,640
craft rises ya hear your side like yeah

01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:06,220
hot there were stupid and friends like

01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:09,760
you know no no no I would I would like

01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:13,720
to say this process would you describe

01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:20,370
this really good for minimizing risk for

01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:23,290
vendors yeah but actually like idea or a

01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:27,940
invitation from from this one guy which

01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:31,000
wasn't from undercut but yeah and ideas

01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:36,460
that we actually would need to figure

01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:40,630
out how to fix problem of client that we

01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:44,470
can define a project on detail level for

01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:47,920
whatever 500,000 our project it's like

01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:51,280
impossible so this is the way how we can

01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:53,650
minimize our risk as a vendor but yeah

01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:55,930
it doesn't actually help or fix the

01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:58,690
problem of the quiet yes client and like

01:00:55,930 --> 01:01:01,000
project but I agree agree there is a

01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:03,430
session from X guy from not one I think

01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:07,420
about this business alleged things but

01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:09,490
well we're talking about HTML yes yes it

01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:11,910
was really I agree yeah yeah thank you

01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:11,910
thank you

01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:28,109
